1,1,The Fortune Teller_Brazilian Tales_eng,CO139CL01
2,2,Hamlet observes to Horatio that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.,CO139CL01
3,3,"This was the selfsame explanation that was given by beautiful Rita to her lover, Camillo, on a certain Friday of November, 1869, when Camillo laughed at her for having gone, the previous evening, to consult a fortune-teller. The only difference is that she made her explanation in other words.",CO139CL01
4,4,"""Laugh, laugh. That's just like you men; you don't believe in anything. Well, let me tell you, I went there and she guessed the reason for my coming before I ever spoke a word. Scarcely had she begun to lay out the cards when she said to me: 'The lady likes a certain person ...'",CO139CL01
5,5,"I confessed that it was so, and then she continued to rearrange the cards in various combinations, finally telling me that I was afraid you would forget me, but that there were no grounds for my fear.""",CO139CL01
6,6,"""She was wrong!"" interrupted Camillo with a laugh.",CO139CL01
7,7,"""Don't say that, Camillo. If you only realized in what anguish I went there, all on account of you. You know. I've told you before. Don't laugh at me; don't poke fun at me....""",CO139CL01
8,8,"Camillo seized her hands and gazed into her eyes earnestly and long. He swore that he loved her ever so much, that her fears were childish; in any case, should she ever harbor a fear, the best fortune-teller to consult was he himself. Then he reproved her, saying that it was imprudent to visit such houses. Villela might learn of it, and then ...",CO139CL01
9,9,"""Impossible! I was exceedingly careful when I entered the place.""",CO139CL01
10,10,"""Where is the house?""",CO139CL01
11,11,"""Near here. On Guarda-Velha Street. Nobody was passing by at the time. Rest easy. I'm not a fool.""",CO139CL01
12,12,Camillo laughed again.,CO139CL01
13,13,"""Do you really believe in such things?"" he asked.",CO139CL01
14,14,"It was at this point that she translated Hamlet into every-day speech, assuring her lover that there was many a true, mysterious thing in this world. If he was skeptical, let him have patience. One thing, however, was certain: the card reader had guessed everything. What more could he desire? The best proof was that at this moment she was at ease and content.",CO139CL01
15,15,"He was about to speak, but he restrained himself. He did not wish to destroy her illusions. He, too, when a child, and even later, had been superstitious, filled with an arsenal of beliefs which his mother had instilled, and which had disappeared by the time he reached twenty.",CO139CL01
16,16,"The day on which he rid himself of all this parasitic vegetation, leaving behind only the trunk of religion, he wrapped his superstition and his religion (which had both been inculcated by his mother) in the same doubt, and soon arrived at a single, total negation.",CO139CL01
17,17,Camillo believed in nothing. Why?,CO139CL01
18,18,"He could not have answered; he had not a solitary reason; he was content simply to deny everything. But I express myself ill, for to deny is in a sense to affirm, and he did not formulate his unbelief. Before the great mystery he simply shrugged his shoulders and went on.",CO139CL01
19,19,"The lovers parted in good spirits, he more happy than she. Rita was sure that she was loved; but Camillo was not only sure that she loved him, but saw how she trembled for him and even took risks, running to fortune-tellers. However much he had reproved her for this, he could not help feeling flattered by it.",CO139CL01
20,20,"Their secret meeting-place was in the old Barbonos street at the home of a woman that came from Rita's province. Rita went off through Mangueiras street, in the direction of Botafogo, where she resided; Camillo entered Guarda-Velha street, keeping his eye open, as he passed, for the home of the card reader.",CO139CL01
21,21,"Villela, Camillo and Rita: three names, one adventure and no explanation of how it all began. Let us proceed to explain. The first two were friends since earliest childhood. Villela had entered the magistracy. Camillo found employment with the government, against the will of his father, who desired him to embrace the medical profession. But his father had died, and Camillo preferred to be nothing at all, until his mother had procured him a departmental position.",CO139CL01
22,22,"At the beginning of the year 1869 Villela returned from the interior, where he had married a silly beauty; he abandoned the magistracy and came hither to open a lawyer's office. Camillo had secured a house for him near Botafogo and had welcomed him home.",CO139CL01
23,23,"""Is this the gentleman?"" exclaimed Rita, offering Camillo her hand. ""You can't imagine how highly my husband thinks of you. He was always talking about you.""",CO139CL01
24,24,Camillo and Villela looked at each other tenderly.,CO139CL01
25,25,"They were true friends. Afterwards, Camillo confessed to himself that Villela's wife did not at all belie the enthusiastic letters her husband had written to him. Really, she was most prepossessing, lively in her movements, her eyes burning, her mouth plastic and piquantly inquiring.",CO139CL01
26,26,"Rita was a trifle older than both the men: she was thirty, Villela twenty-nine and Camillo twenty-six. The grave bearing of Villela gave him the appearance of being much older than his wife, while Camillo was but a child in moral and practical life.... He possessed neither experience nor intuition.",CO139CL01
27,27,"The three became closely bound. Propinquity bred intimacy. Shortly afterwards Camillo's mother died, and in this catastrophe, for such it was, the other two showed themselves to be genuine friends of his. Villela took charge of the interment, of the church services and the settlement of the affairs of the deceased; Rita dispensed consolation, and none could do it better.",CO139CL01
28,28,"Just how this intimacy between Camillo and Rita grew to love he never knew. The truth is that he enjoyed passing the hours at her side; she was his spiritual nurse, almost a sister,—but most of all she was a woman, and beautiful.",CO139CL01
29,29,"The aroma of femininity: this is what he yearned for in her, and about her, seeking to incorporate it into himself. They read the same books, they went together to the theatre or for walks. He taught her cards and chess, and they played of nights;—she badly,—he, to make himself agreeable, but little less badly. Thus much, as far as external things are concerned. And now came personal intimacies, the timorous eyes of Rita, that so often sought his own, consulting them before they questioned those of her own husband,—the touches of cold hands, and unwonted communion. On one of his birthdays he received from Villela a costly cane, and from Rita, a hastily pencilled, ordinary note expressing good wishes. It was then that he learned to read within his own heart; he could not tear his eyes away from the missive.",CO139CL01
30,30,"Commonplace words, it is true; but there are sublime commonplaces,—or at least, delightful ones. The old chaise in which for the first time you rode with your beloved, snuggled together, is as good as the chariot of Apollo. Such is man, and such are the circumstances that surround him.",CO139CL01
31,31,"Camillo sincerely wished to flee the situation, but it was already beyond his power. Rita, like a serpent, was charming him, winding her coils about him; she was crushing his bones, darting her venomous fangs into his lips. He was helpless, overcome. Vexation, fear, remorse, desire,—all this he felt, in a strange confusion. But the battle was short and the victory deliriously intoxicating. Farewell, all scruple!",CO139CL01
32,32,"The shoe now fitted snugly enough upon the foot, and there they were both, launched upon the high road, arm in arm, joyfully treading the grass and the gravel, without suffering anything more than lonesomeness when they were away from each other. As to Villela, his confidence in his wife and his esteem for his friend continued the same as before.",CO139CL01
33,33,"One day, however, Camillo received an anonymous letter, which called him immoral and perfidious, and warned him that his adventure was known to all. Camillo took fright, and, in order to ward off suspicion, began to make his visits to Villela's house more rare. The latter asked him the reason for his prolonged absence.",CO139CL01
34,34,"Camillo answered that the cause was a youthful flirtation. Simplicity evolved into cunning. Camillo's absences became longer and longer, and then his visits ceased entirely. Into this course there may have entered a little self-respect,—the idea of diminishing his obligations to the husband in order to make his own actions appear less treacherous.",CO139CL01
35,35,"It was at this juncture that Rita, uncertain and in fear, ran to the fortune-teller to consult her upon the real reason for Camillo's actions. As we have seen, the card reader restored the wife's confidence and the young man reproved her for having done what she did. A few weeks passed. Camillo received two or three more anonymous letters, written with such passionate anger that they could not have been prompted by mere regard for virtue; surely they came from some violent rival of his. In this opinion Rita concurred, formulating, in ill-composed words of her own, this thought: virtue is indolent and niggardly, wasting neither time nor paper; only self-interest is alert and prodigal.",CO139CL01
36,36,"But this did not help to ease Camillo; he now feared lest the anonymous writer should inform Villela, in which case the catastrophe would follow fast and implacably. Rita agreed that this was possible.",CO139CL01
37,37,"""Very well,"" she said. ""Give me the envelopes in which the letters came, so that I may compare the handwriting with that of the mail which comes to him. If any arrives with writing resembling the anonymous script, I'll keep it and tear it up ..."" <TRANSLATION ADDED>",CO139CL01
38,38,"But no such letter appeared. A short time after this, however, Villela commenced to grow grave, speaking very little, as if something weighed upon his mind. Rita hurried to communicate the change to her lover, and they discussed the matter earnestly. Her opinion was that Camillo should renew his visits to their home, and sound her husband; it might be that Villela would confide to him some business worry.",CO139CL01
39,39,"With this Camillo disagreed; to appear after so many months was to confirm the suspicions and denunciations of the anonymous letters. It was better to be very careful, to give each other up for several weeks. They arranged means for communicating with each other in case of necessity and separated, in tears.",CO139CL01
40,40,"On the following day Camillo received at his department this letter from Villela: ""Come immediately to our house; I must talk to you without delay."" It was past noon. Camillo left at once; as he reached the street it occurred to him that it would have been much more natural for Villela to have called him to his office; why to his house? All this betokened a very urgent matter; moreover, whether it was reality or illusion, it seemed to Camillo that the letter was written in a trembling hand. He sought to establish a connection between all these things and the news Rita had brought him the night before.",CO139CL01
41,41,"""Come immediately to our house; I must talk to you without delay,"" he repeated, his eyes staring at the note.",CO139CL01
42,42,"In his mind's eye he beheld the climax of a drama,—Rita cowed, weeping; Villela indignant, seizing his pen and dashing off the letter, certain that he, Camillo, would answer in person, and waiting to kill him as he entered. Camillo shuddered with terror; then he smiled weakly; in any event the idea of drawing back was repugnant to him. So he continued on his way. As he walked it occurred to him to step into his rooms; he might find there a message from Rita explaining everything. But he found nothing, nobody.",CO139CL01
43,43,"He returned to the street, and the thought that they had been discovered grew every moment more convincing; yes, the author of the previous anonymous communications must have denounced him to the husband; perhaps by now Villela knew all. The very suspension of his calls without any apparent reason, with the flimsiest of pretexts, would confirm everything else.",CO139CL01
44,44,"Camillo walked hastily along, agitated, nervous. He did not read the letter again, but the words hovered persistently before his eyes; or else,—which was even worse—they seemed to be murmured into his ears by the voice of Villela himself. ""Come immediately to our house; I must talk to you without delay."" Spoken thus by the voice of the other they seemed pregnant with mystery and menace. Come immediately,—why? It was now nearly one o'clock. Camillo's agitation waxed greater with each passing moment.",CO139CL01
45,45,"So clearly did he imagine what was about to take place that he began to believe it a reality, to see it before his very eyes. Yes, without a doubt, he was afraid. He even considered arming himself, thinking that if nothing should happen he would lose nothing by this useful precaution. But at once he rejected the idea, angry with himself, and hastened his step towards Carioca square, there to take a tilbury. He arrived, entered and ordered the driver to be off at full speed.",CO139CL01
46,46,"""The sooner the better,"" he thought. ""I can't stand this uncertainty.""",CO139CL01
47,47,"But the very sound of the horse's clattering hoofs increased his agitation. Time was flying, and he would be face to face with danger soon enough. When they had come almost to the end of Guarda-Velha street the tilbury had to come to a stop; the thoroughfare was blocked by a coach that had broken down. Camillo surveyed the obstruction and decided to wait. After five minutes had gone by, he noticed that there at his left, at the very foot of the tilbury, was the fortune teller's house,—the very same as Rita had once consulted. Never, as at this moment, had he so desired to believe in card-reading.",CO139CL01
48,48,"He looked closer, saw that the windows were closed, while all the others on the street were opened, filled with folks curious to see what was the matter. It looked for all the world like the dwelling of indifferent Fate.",CO139CL01
49,49,"Camillo leaned back in his seat so as to shut all this from view. His excitement was intense, extraordinary, and from the deep, hidden recesses of his mind there began to emerge spectres of early childhood, old beliefs, banished superstitions. The coachman proposed another route; he shook his head and said that he would wait. He leaned forward to get a better look at the card-reader's house ... Then he made a gesture of self-ridicule: it had entered his mind to consult the fortune-teller, who seemed to be hovering over him, far, far above, with vast, ash-colored wings; she disappeared, reappeared, and then her image was lost; then, in a few moments, the ash-colored wings stirred again, nearer, flying about him in narrowing circles ... In the street men were shouting, dragging away the coach.",CO139CL01
50,50,"""There! Now! Push! That's it! Now!""",CO139CL01
51,51,"In a short while the obstruction was removed. Camillo closed his eyes, trying to think of other things; but the voice of Rita's husband whispered into his ears the words of the letter: ""Come immediately ...""",CO139CL01
52,52,"And he could behold the anguish of the drama. He trembled. The house seemed to look right at him. His feet instinctively moved as if to leave the carriage and go in ... Camillo found himself before a long, opaque veil ... he thought rapidly of the inexplicability of so many things. The voice of his mother was repeating to him a host of extraordinary happenings; and the very sentence of the Prince of Denmark kept echoing within him: ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in our philosophy."" What could he lose by it, if...?",CO139CL01
53,53,"He jumped out to the pavement, just before the fortune-teller's door; he told the driver to wait for him, and hastened into the entry, ascending the stairs. There was little light, the stairs were worn away from the many feet that had sought them, the banister was smooth and sticky; but he saw and felt nothing. He stumbled up the stairs and knocked. Nobody appearing, he was about to go down; but it was too late now,—curiosity was whipping his blood and his heart beat with violent throbs; he turned back to the door, and knocked once, twice, three times. He beheld a woman; it was the card-reader. Camillo said that he had come to consult her, and she bade him enter.",CO139CL01
54,54,"Thence they climbed to the attic by a staircase even worse than the first and buried in deeper gloom. At the top there was a garret, ill lighted by a small window.",CO139CL01
55,55,"Old furniture, somber walls, and an air of poverty augmented, rather than destroyed, the prestige of the occupant.",CO139CL01
56,56,"The fortune-teller told him to be seated before the table, and she sat down on the opposite side with her back to the window, so that whatever little light came from without fell full upon Camillo's face.",CO139CL01
57,57,"She opened a drawer and took out a pack of worn, filthy cards. While she rapidly shuffled them she peered at him closely, not so much with a direct gaze as from under her eyes.",CO139CL01
58,58,"She was a woman of forty, Italian, thin and swarthy, with large, sharp, cunning eyes. She placed three cards upon the table, and said:",CO139CL01
59,59,"""Let us first see what has brought you here. The gentleman has just received a severe shock and is in great fear ..."" Camillo, astonished, nodded affirmatively.",CO139CL01
60,60,"""And he wishes to know,"" she continued, ""whether anything will happen to him or not ...""",CO139CL01
61,61,"""To me and to her,"" he explained, excitedly.",CO139CL01
62,62,"The fortune-teller did not smile; she simply told him to wait. She took the cards hastily once more and shuffled them with her long tapering fingers whose nails were so long and unclean from neglect; she shuffled them well, once, twice, thrice; then she began to lay them out. Camillo's eyes were riveted upon her in anxious curiosity.",CO139CL01
63,63,"""The cards tell me ...""",CO139CL01
64,64,"Camillo leaned forward to drink in her words one by one. Then she told him to fear nothing. Nothing would happen to him or to the other. He, the third, was aware of nought. Nevertheless, great caution was indispensable; envy and rivalry were at work. She spoke to him of the love that bound them, of Rita's beauty ... Camillo was bewildered. The fortune-teller stopped talking, gathered the cards and locked them in the drawer.",CO139CL01
65,65,"""The lady has restored peace to my spirit,"" he said, offering her his hand across the table and pressing that of the card-reader.",CO139CL01
66,66,"She arose, laughing.",CO139CL01
67,67,"""Go,"" she said. ""Go, ragazzo innamorato ...""",CO139CL01
68,68,"And arising, she touched his head with her index finger. Camillo shuddered, as if it were the hand of one of the original sybils, and he, too, arose. The fortune-teller went to the bureau, upon which lay a plate of raisins, took a cluster of them and commenced to eat them, showing two rows of teeth that were as white as her nails were black. Even in this common action the woman possessed an air all her own. Camillo, anxious to leave, was at a loss how much to pay; he did not know her fee.",CO139CL01
69,69,"""Raisins cost money,"" he said, at length, taking out his pocket-book. ""How much do you want to send for?""",CO139CL01
70,70,"""Ask your heart,"" she replied.",CO139CL01
71,71,Camillo took out a note for ten milreis'[5] and gave it to her. The eyes of the card-reader sparkled. Her usual fee was two milreis.,CO139CL01
72,72,"""I can see easily that the gentleman loves his lady very much ... And well he may. For she loves the gentleman very deeply, too. Go, go in peace, with your mind at ease. And take care as you descend the staircase,—it's dark. Don't forget your hat ...""",CO139CL01
73,73,"The fortune-teller had already placed the note in her pocket, and accompanied him down the stairs, chatting rather gaily. At the bottom of the first flight Camillo bid her good-bye and ran down the stairs that led to the street, while the card-reader, rejoicing in her large fee, turned back to the garret, humming a barcarolle. Camillo found the tilbury waiting for him; the street was now clear. He entered and the driver whipped his horse into a fast trot.",CO139CL01
74,74,"To Camillo everything had now changed for the better and his affairs assumed a brighter aspect; the sky was clear and the faces of the people he passed were all so merry. He even began to laugh at his fears, which he now saw were puerile; he recalled the language of Villela's letter and perceived at once that it was most friendly and familiar. How in the world had he ever been able to read any threat of danger into those words! He suddenly realized that they were urgent, however, and that he had done ill to delay so long; it might be some very serious business affair.",CO139CL01
75,75,"""Faster, faster!"" he cried to the driver.",CO139CL01
76,76,"And he began to think of a plausible explanation of his delay; he even contemplated taking advantage of this incident to re-establish his former intimacy in Villela's household ... Together with his plans there kept echoing in his soul the words of the fortune-teller. In truth, she had guessed the object of his visit, his own state of mind, and the existence of a third; why, then, wasn't it reasonable to suppose that she had guessed the rest correctly, too? For, the unknown present is the same as the future. And thus, slowly and persistently the young man's childhood superstitions attained the upper hand and mystery clutched him in its iron claws. At times he was ready to burst into laughter, and with a certain vexation he did laugh at himself. But the woman, the cards, her dry, reassuring words, and her good-bye—",CO139CL01
77,77,"Go, go, ragazzo innamorato, and finally, that farewell barcarolle, so lively and gracious,—such were the new elements which, together with the old, formed within him a new and abiding faith.",CO139CL01
78,78,"The truth is that his heart was happy and impatient, recalling the happy hours of the past and anticipating those yet to come. As he passed through Gloria street Camillo gazed across the sea, far across where the waters and the heaven meet in endless embrace, and the sight gave him a sensation of the future,—long, long and infinite.",CO139CL01
79,79,"From here it was but a moment's drive to Villela's home. He stepped out, thrust the iron garden gate open and entered. The house was silent. He ran up the six stone steps and scarcely had he had time to knock when the door opened and Villela loomed before him.",CO139CL01
80,80,"""Pardon my delay. It was impossible to come sooner. What is the matter?""",CO139CL01
81,81,"Villela made no reply. His features were distorted; he beckoned Camillo to step within. As he entered, Camillo could not repress a cry of horror:—there upon the sofa lay Rita, dead in a pool of blood. Villela seized the lover by the throat and, with two bullets, stretched him dead upon the floor.",CO139CL01

83,2,Hamlet observes to horatio that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in his philosophy.,CO139CL04
84,3,"The lovely Rita gave this same explanation to young Camilo, one Friday in November 1869, when he was laughing at her for having consulted a fortune-teller the day before; the only difference was that she used other words to express the idea.",CO139CL04
85,4,"‘Go on, laugh if you want. That’s men for you; they don’t believe in anything. Well, I did go, and she knew why I was consulting her even before I’d told her. She’d hardly begun to lay out the cards when she said to me, “You’re fond of someone …”",CO139CL04
86,5,"I confessed I was, and then she went on laying out the cards, put them in order, and then told me I was frightened you’d forget me, but there was no need …’",CO139CL04
87,6,"‘Wrong!’ Camilo interrupted, laughing.",CO139CL04
88,7,"‘Don’t say that, Camilo. If you knew how I’ve been lately, because of you. You know; I’ve told you. Don’t laugh at me, don’t laugh …’",CO139CL04
89,8,"Camilo took hold of her hands, and gazed at her with a serious, steady look. He swore he really loved her, that these were childish fears; in any case, if she was at all fearful, he was the best fortune-teller to come to. Then he reproached her, and said it was imprudent to go to houses like that. Vilela might get to know about it, and then …",CO139CL04
90,9,‘Not a chance! I took great care as I went in.’,CO139CL04
91,10,‘Where’s the house?’,CO139CL04
92,11,"‘Near here, in the Rua da Guarda Velha; there was no one in the street at the time. Don’t worry; I’m not crazy.’",CO139CL04
93,12,Camilo laughed again:,CO139CL04
94,13,‘Do you really believe in that kind of thing?’ he asked her.,CO139CL04
95,14,"That was when, without knowing she was translating Hamlet into common speech, she told him that there are lots of mysterious things in the world that are true. If he didn’t believe her, fine; but the truth is that the fortune-teller had divined everything. What more did he want? The proof is that now she was calm and contented.",CO139CL04
96,15,"I think he was going to say something, but he stopped himself. He didn’t want to deprive her of her illusions. He too, when he was a boy, and even later in life, had been superstitious; he’d had a whole arsenal of absurd beliefs impressed on him by his mother, which disappeared when he was twenty.",CO139CL04
97,16,"This parasitic vegetation then fell away, leaving only the main trunk of religion; but since he’d received both from his mother, he wrapped them up in the same doubt, and soon afterwards in a single total denial.",CO139CL04
98,17,Camilo believed in nothing. Why?,CO139CL04
99,18,"He couldn’t say; he didn’t have a single argument, and limited himself to denying everything. Even that isn’t right, because denying something is still a kind of affirmation, and he didn’t put his disbelief into words; faced by life’s mystery, he was happy to shrug his shoulders and carry on as before.",CO139CL04
100,19,"They went their separate ways; each of them was happy, he even more than she. Rita was certain she was loved; Camilo not only was sure of that, but saw how she trembled and risked herself for him by going to fortune-tellers – however much he reproached her, he couldn’t but feel flattered.",CO139CL04
101,20,"The house they’d met in was in the old Rua dos Barbonos, where a friend of Rita’s from her home town lived. Rita went off down the Rua das Mangueiras towards her home in Botafogo; Camilo went down the Rua da Guarda Velha, looking at the fortune-teller’s house as he passed.",CO139CL04
102,21,"Vilela, Camilo and Rita, three names – an affair, then, but what about its origins? Here they are. The first two were childhood friends. Vilela studied to be a lawyer, and became a magistrate. Camilo trained to be a civil servant, against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to be a doctor; but his father died, and Camilo preferred doing nothing, until his mother got him an administrative job.",CO139CL04
103,22,"In early 1869, Vilela came back from the provinces, where he’d married a beautiful, foolish woman; he abandoned the magistracy and opened a law firm. Camilo got him a house in the Botafogo area, and went on board ship to welcome him.",CO139CL04
104,23,"‘Is it you?’ Rita had exclaimed, holding out her hand. ‘You can’t imagine how much my husband thinks of you; he was always talking about you.’",CO139CL04
105,24,Camilo and Vilela looked at each other affectionately. .,CO139CL04
106,25,"They were true friends. Then, Camilo confessed to himself that Vilela’s wife didn’t belie her husband’s letters. She really was a lovely, vivacious woman, her eyes were warm, her mouth delicate and inquisitive.",CO139CL04
107,26,"She was a little older than either – thirty, while Vilela was twenty-nine and Camilo twenty-six. However, Vilela’s air of severity made him look older than his wife, while Camilo was an innocent in the moral and practical sides of life. Time had taught him nothing, and he was not provided with the crystal spectacles nature puts in some people’s cradles to foresee the effects of time. He possessed neither experience nor intuition.",CO139CL04
108,27,"The three became fast friends. Daily contact brought on intimacy. A little later, Camilo’s mother died, and in this calamity – which was what it was – the other two stuck by him and showed real friendship. Vilela looked after the funeral, the Masses and the inventory; Rita especially looked after the emotional side of things, and no one could have done it better.",CO139CL04
109,28,"How they moved from this stage to love he never knew. The truth is that he liked spending time in her company; she was his moral nurse, almost a sister, but more than anything else she was a woman, and a pretty one.",CO139CL04
110,29,"Odor di femmina: that was what he scented in her and around her, and it enveloped him. They read the same books, went to the theatre and on trips together. Camilo taught her draughts and chess and they played in the evenings; she played badly – he, to be agreeable to her, a little less badly. So much for the preliminaries: then there was the woman herself, Rita, with her insistent eyes, which often sought his out, which consulted him before her husband, her cold hands, her unexpected attitudes. One day, on his birthday, he got an expensive walking stick from Vilela, from Rita only a card with plain good wishes in pencil, and it was then he started to read his own heart; he couldn’t tear his eyes from the words.",CO139CL04
111,30,"Common words; but things can be common and sublime or, at least, delicious. The old hired cab in which you first went for a ride with your loved one with the curtains down is worth as much as Apollo’s chariot. That’s the nature of man, and of the things that surround him.",CO139CL04
112,31,"Camilo sincerely wanted to escape, but he couldn’t. Rita, like a snake, moved closer and closer, wrapped herself round him, made his bones crack in a single spasm, and dropped her venom on his lips. He was stunned, and submitted. Embarrassment, fright, remorse, desire – he felt them all, each mixed with the other; but the battle was short and the victory ecstatic. Goodbye to scruples!",CO139CL04
113,32,"It didn’t take long for the shoe to adjust itself to the foot, and there they went along the high road, arm in arm, happily treading on plants and pebbles, suffering nothing but a little longing when they were apart. Vilela’s trust and esteem were the same as ever.",CO139CL04
114,33,"One day, however, Camilo received an anonymous letter, calling him immoral and perfidious, and saying that their adventure was public knowledge. Camilo was afraid, and, to deflect suspicions, began to visit Vilela’s house less often. The latter noticed his absences.",CO139CL04
115,34,"Camilo replied that the cause was a trivial, youthful love affair. Innocence bred guile. His absences became longer and longer, until the visits came to a complete stop. Maybe a little amour propre came into it too, a desire to lessen the husband’s favours, and so make the betrayal itself less burdensome.",CO139CL04
116,35,"It was around this time that Rita, suspicious and fearful, had recourse to the fortune-teller to ask her about the real cause of Camilo’s behaviour. We have seen that the fortune-teller restored her trust, and that the young man reprimanded her. A few weeks went by. Camilo got two or three more anonymous letters, so heated, that they couldn’t have been prompted by a concern for virtue or morality; they were written by some jealous, thwarted lover; this was Rita’s opinion, who formulated this thought in other, ill-expressed words: virtue is lazy and stingy, and doesn’t waste time or paper; only self-interest is active and spendthrift.",CO139CL04
117,36,"This made Camilo no less anxious; he feared that the anonymous author would go to see Vilela, and then catastrophe would be unavoidable. Rita agreed it was possible.",CO139CL04
118,37,"‘Well,’ she said, ‘I’ll take the envelopes to compare the writing with any letters that appear there; if any are the same, I’ll take them and tear them up …’",CO139CL04
119,38,"None came; but a little time later Vilela began to look morose, saying little, as if he was suspicious. Rita lost no time in telling her lover, and they deliberated on the matter. Her opinion was that Camilo should go back to their house, sound out her husband, and maybe he would confide some private trouble to him.",CO139CL04
120,39,"Camilo begged to differ; to appear after so many months was to confirm the suspicion or the accusation. It was better that they should be cautious, and sacrifice themselves for a few weeks. They fixed a way of exchanging news, if they had to, and tearfully separated.",CO139CL04
121,40,"The following day, at work, Camilo got a message from Vilela: ‘Come to our house instantly; I need to speak to you without delay.’ It was after midday. Camilo left immediately; in the street, he realised it would have been more natural for Vilela to have asked him to come to his office; why at home? Everything pointed to something unusual, and the handwriting, rightly or not, looked shaky to him. He put all these things together with yesterday’s news.",CO139CL04
122,41,"‘Come to our house instantly; I need to speak to you without delay,’ he repeated, staring at the piece of paper.",CO139CL04
123,42,"In his imagination, he saw the tip of a drama – Rita humiliated and in tears, Vilela indignant, taking up the pen, certain he would come, and waiting there to kill him. Camilo shivered, he was frightened; then he smiled nervously – in any case, any idea of going back was repugnant to him, and he went on his way. As he did so, it occurred to him to go home; he might find a message from Rita explaining everything. There was nothing there, nobody.",CO139CL04
124,43,"He went back into the street, and the idea that they had been found out began to seem more and more probable; some kind of anonymous accusation was likely, perhaps from the same person who had threatened him before; maybe Vilela now knew everything. The cessation of his visits for no apparent motive, on a feeble pretext, must have confirmed everything else.",CO139CL04
125,44,"Camilo went on his way, worried and nervous. He didn’t reread the note, but he had the words by heart, fixed, in front of his eyes; or, what was even worse, they were whispered in his ear, in Vilela’s own voice. ‘Come to our house instantly; I need to speak to you without delay.’ Said in this way, in another’s voice, they had a tone of mystery and menace. Come instantly, what for? It was nearly one in the afternoon. He became more and more agitated by the minute.",CO139CL04
126,45,"His imagination was so fixed on what might happen that he began to believe it and see it. He was genuinely afraid. He considered taking a weapon with him, thinking that, if there was nothing wrong, nothing would be lost by doing so, and it was a useful precaution. Soon after, he rejected the idea, ashamed of himself, and went on, hurriedly, towards the Largo da Carioca, to get a cab. He got there, got in, and ordered the driver to go fast.",CO139CL04
127,46,"‘The sooner the better,’ he thought, ‘I can’t carry on in this state …’",CO139CL04
128,47,"But even the horse’s trotting worsened his anxiety. Time was flying, and very soon he’d be face to face with the danger. Almost at the end of the Rua da Guarda Velha the cab had to stop; the street was blocked by an upturned cart. Camilo, at bottom, was glad of the obstacle, and waited. After five minutes, he noticed that at the roadside, on the left, right by the cab, was the fortune-teller’s house, the one Rita had once consulted, and never before had he wanted so much to believe in the lessons the cards had to teach.",CO139CL04
129,48,"He looked and saw the windows, closed, while all the others were open and jammed with faces looking at the incident in the street. You might have said it was the abode of indifferent Destiny itself.",CO139CL04
130,49,"Camilo leaned back in the cab, so as to see nothing. He was very agitated indeed, extraordinarily so, and from the depths of his moral being emerged ghosts of another time, old beliefs, ancient superstitions. The cab driver suggested that they go back to the first cross-street, and go by another route; he said no, they should wait. And he leaned forward to look at the house … Then he made an incredulous gesture: it was the idea of hearing what the fortune-teller had to say, passing by in the distance, far away, with huge grey wings; the idea disappeared, came back again, and once more faded out of his mind; but a little later it flapped its wings again, closer now, sweeping round in concentric circles. In the street, men were shouting, freeing the cart:",CO139CL04
131,50,"‘Right now! Push! Come on, come on!’",CO139CL04
132,51,"The obstacle would soon be removed. Camilo shut his eyes, thought about other things; but the husband’s voice whispered in his ears the words of the letter: ‘Don’t delay, come, come …’",CO139CL04
133,52,"He saw the twists in this drama, he was shaking. The house was looking at him. His legs wanted to get down and go in … Camilo found himself in front of a long opaque veil … hurriedly, he thought about how so many things are inexplicable. His mother’s voice was telling him about a large number of extraordinary happenings, and the Prince of Denmark’s very own words echoed inside him: ‘There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.’ What was there to lose, if …?",CO139CL04
134,53,"He came to on the pavement, right next to the door, told the driver to wait, and quickly slipped into the corridor and up the stairs. There was very little light, the stairs were worn down and the handrail was sticky; but he saw and felt none of this. He ran up and knocked. Nobody came, and he thought of going back down; but it was too late, his heart was beating fast, his temples throbbing; he knocked, once, twice, three times. A woman came; it was the fortune-teller. Camilo said he’d come to consult her, and she asked him in.",CO139CL04
135,54,"From there they went up to the attic, by a staircase worse than the first one, and darker. At the top was a little room, badly lit from a window which gave on to the roofs at the back.",CO139CL04
136,55,"Old bits of furniture, dark walls, an air of poverty – all of which, far from destroying the impact of the place, increased it.",CO139CL04
137,56,"The fortune-teller asked him to sit on one side of the table, and herself sat down on the other side, her back to the window, so that the little light coming from outside fully illuminated Camilo’s face.",CO139CL04
138,57,"She opened a drawer and took out a pack of cards, large and soiled. While she shuffled them, quickly, she was looking at him, not full in the face, but from under her lids.",CO139CL04
139,58,"She was a woman of forty, Italian, dark and thin, with big, cunning, acute eyes. She turned three cards on the table over, and said to him:",CO139CL04
140,59,"‘First, let’s see what brings you here. You’ve had a shock …’ Camilo, astonished, gestured that he had.",CO139CL04
141,60,"‘And you want to know,’ she went on, ‘if something is going to happen to you or not …’",CO139CL04
142,61,"‘To me and her,’ he hurriedly explained.",CO139CL04
143,62,"The fortune-teller didn’t smile; she only told him to wait. Quickly she picked up the cards again and shuffled them with her long thin fingers, their nails neglected; she shuffled them well, changing the groups of cards once, twice, three times over; then she began to lay them out. Camilo’s eyes were fixed on her, curious and anxious.",CO139CL04
144,63,‘The cards are telling me …’,CO139CL04
145,64,"Camilo leaned over to drink her words in one by one. Then she told him not to be afraid of anything. Nothing would happen to one or the other; he, the third person, was ignorant of everything. Nevertheless, they must be very cautious; envy and resentment were seething round them. She told him of the love between them, of Rita’s beauty. Camilo was amazed. The fortune-teller finished, gathered up the cards and shut them in the drawer.",CO139CL04
146,65,"‘You have given me peace of mind,’ he said, stretching over the table, and grasping her hand in his.",CO139CL04
147,66,"She got up, laughing.",CO139CL04
148,67,"‘Go on,’ she said, ‘off you go, ragazzo innamorato.’",CO139CL04
149,68,"As she stood there, she touched him on the head with her index finger. Camilo trembled, as if it was the hand of the Sibyl herself, and got up too. The fortune-teller went over to the dresser, on which there was a plate with some raisins, picked a bunch, and began to tear them off and eat them, showing two rows of teeth which formed a vivid contrast to her nails. Even in this everyday act, the woman had a peculiar air about her. Camilo, anxious to go, didn’t know how to pay; he didn’t know what the price was.",CO139CL04
150,69,"‘Raisins cost money,’ he said finally, taking out his wallet. ‘How many do you want to send out for?’",CO139CL04
151,70,"‘Ask your heart,’ she replied.",CO139CL04
152,71,"Camilo got a ten mil-reis note out, and gave it to her. The fortune-teller’s eyes flashed. The usual price was two mil-reis.",CO139CL04
153,72,"‘I see you love her very much … and you’re right. She loves you very much too. Go with peace of mind. Careful of the staircase, it’s dark; put your hat on …’",CO139CL04
154,73,"The fortune-teller had already put the note in her pocket, and was going downstairs with him, talking with a slight accent. Camilo said goodbye to her below and went down the stairs leading to the street, while the fortune-teller, happy with her payment, went back up, humming a barcarolle. Camilo found the cab waiting; the street was clear. He got in and went on at a canter.",CO139CL04
155,74,"Everything seemed better now, things had another aspect to them, the sky was clear, and faces were cheery. He began to laugh at his fears, calling them puerile; he remembered the terms of Vilela’s letter and had to recognise they were intimate and familiar. What had he found so menacing? He also noted that the terms of the letter were urgent, and he’d done wrong in taking so much time; it might be something really serious.",CO139CL04
156,75,"‘Go as fast as you can,’ he said to the cab man more than once.",CO139CL04
157,76,"To himself, so as to explain the delay to his friend, he thought up some story; it seems he also devised a plan to take advantage of the incident to return to the frequent visits … Along with the plans, the fortune-teller’s words echoed in his soul. It was true, she had divined the object of the consultation, his state of mind, the existence of a third person; why should she not divine the rest? Thus it was, slowly and unerringly, that the young man’s old beliefs came back to the surface, and mystery gripped him in its nails of steel. Sometimes he wanted to laugh, and laughed at himself, somewhat shamefaced; but the woman, the cards, the dry, confident words, her exhortation:",CO139CL04
158,77,"‘Off you go, ragazzo innamorato’; and finally, the barcarolle as she said goodbye, slow and graceful – these were the new elements which, together with the old ones, made up a new and vibrant faith.",CO139CL04
159,78,"The truth is that his heart was content and impatient, thinking of happy times in the past and others which were on their way. As he passed Glória, Camilo looked out over the sea, looked far out, at the point where the sea and sky form an infinite embrace, and had the sensation of a long, long, unbroken future.",CO139CL04
160,79,"A little later he got to Vilela’s house. He got down, pushed the iron garden gate and went in. The house was silent. He went up the six stone steps, and had hardly had time to knock when the door opened, and Vilela appeared.",CO139CL04
161,80,"‘Sorry, I couldn’t come any sooner; what’s happened?’",CO139CL04
162,81,"Vilela didn’t reply; he had a deranged look; he beckoned him in, and they went into a small room inside. Going in, Camilo couldn’t suppress a shriek of terror – at the back, on the sofa, was Rita, dead and bloody. Vilela grabbed him by the throat, and with two shots of his revolver, stretched him out dead on the floor.",CO139CL04

166,4,"“Go on, then, laugh. You men are all the same; you don’t believe in anything. But just so you know, when I went there, the woman knew exactly why I’d come even before I told her. As soon as she started laying down the cards, she said to me: “You love someone . . .”",CO139CL10

170,8,"Camilo clasped her hands and gazed earnestly into her eyes. He swore that he loved her deeply and that her fears were pure childishness; in any event, if she had any fears, he was the best fortune-teller to come to. Then he scolded her, telling her it was unwise to visit such places. Vilela might find out, and then . . .",CO139CL10

174,12,Camilo laughed again:,CO139CL10
175,13,“So you really believe in such things?” he asked.,CO139CL10
176,14,"It was then that she, not knowing she was translating Hamlet into everyday language, told him that there were many things in this world that are both mysterious and true. So what if he didn’t believe her—the truth was that the fortune-teller had foreseen everything. What more did he want? Now she felt perfectly calm and contented, and that was the proof.",CO139CL10
177,15,"I think Camilo was about to say something, but stopped himself. He didn’t want to destroy her illusions. He had been superstitious as a child and even for some time afterward, full of a whole arsenal of irrational beliefs that his mother had instilled in him, and which disappeared when he turned twenty.",CO139CL10
178,16,"On the day he stripped away all this parasitical vegetation to reveal the bare trunk of religion, he, since he had learned both lessons from his mother, wrapped them in the same newfound skepticism and, soon afterward, discarded them both.",CO139CL10
179,17,Camilo didn’t believe in anything. Why?,CO139CL10
180,18,"He couldn’t say; he had no one reason, and so contented himself with rejecting everything. But even that isn’t quite right, since rejection is itself a form of affirmation and he could not put his disbelief into words; in the face of such mysteries, he merely shrugged his shoulders and carried on regardless.",CO139CL10
181,19,"They parted in good spirits, he even more than she. Rita was sure of being loved; Camilo was not only sure of that, but also saw how she trembled and ran risks for him, for example, by resorting to visiting fortune-tellers. Though he scolded her, he couldn’t help feeling flattered.",CO139CL10
182,20,"Their meeting place was a house on the old Rua dos Barbonos, where a woman from Rita’s home province was living. Rita walked down Rua das Mangueiras toward Botafogo, where she lived, and Camilo set off down Rua da Guarda Velha, glancing on his way at the fortune-teller’s house.",CO139CL10
183,21,"Vilela, Camilo, and Rita: three names, one adventure, and no explanation whatsoever as to how we got there. So let me explain. The first two were childhood friends. Vilela took up a career as a local magistrate, while Camilo went into the civil service, much against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to be a doctor. However, his father died, and Camilo preferred doing nothing at all, until his mother found him a government position.",CO139CL10
184,22,"At the beginning of 1869, Vilela returned from the provinces, where he’d married a very beautiful, but empty-headed young woman. He had given up the magistracy and come back to the city to set up a law firm. Camilo found him a house near Botafogo, and boarded the steamer to welcome him home.",CO139CL10
185,23,"“Is it you, sir?” exclaimed Rita, holding out her hand to Camilo. “You cannot imagine how highly my husband values your friendship, for he is always talking about you.”",CO139CL10
186,24,Camilo and Vilela gazed warmly at each other.,CO139CL10
187,25,"They were friends indeed. Afterward, Camilo had to admit that Vilela’s wife entirely lived up to her husband’s letters. She really was both graceful and vivacious, with warm eyes and a delicate, inquisitive mouth.",CO139CL10
188,26,"She was a little older than both of them: she was thirty, Vilela twenty-nine, and Camilo twenty-six. Vilela’s grave demeanor, however, made him appear older than his wife, whereas Camilo was an innocent in all things practical and moral. He had acquired none of the knowledge that normally comes with the years, nor had nature endowed him with the “spectacles” it bestows on some almost at birth, giving them wisdom beyond their years; in short, he lacked both experience and intuition.",CO139CL10
189,27,"The three of them became inseparable. Proximity led to intimacy. Then Camilo’s mother died, and in this disaster (for so it was) both Vilela and Rita gave proof of their great friendship for him. Vilela dealt with all the arrangements for the funeral, the mass, and the inventory of the deceased’s belongings, while Rita took special care of his emotional needs, and no one could have done it better.",CO139CL10
190,28,"How they went from that to love, he never quite knew. He certainly enjoyed spending hours at her side; she was his spiritual nurse, almost his sister, but most of all she was a beautiful woman.",CO139CL10
191,29,"Odor di femmina, the scent of a woman: that is what he breathed in from her and from the air about her, until it became part of his own self. They read the same books and went on walks together and to the theater. Camilo taught her chess and draughts, and they played every night, she badly, and he, wishing to make himself agreeable, not much better. I think you get the picture. Then came effects of a more physical nature: there were Rita’s willful eyes persistently seeking his and consulting his even before her husband’s; her strangely cold hands; the occasional unexpected exchange of glances. On his birthday, he received from Vilela the gift of a magnificent walking cane, and from Rita only a card with the plainest of greetings written in pencil. It was then that Camilo learned to read his own heart, for he could not tear his eyes away from that little scrap of paper.",CO139CL10
192,30,"Banal words, but some banalities are sublime, or at least delectable. The decrepit old hansom cab in which you and your ladylove first rode together entirely alone is as fine a thing as Apollo’s chariot. Such is man, and such are the things that surround him.",CO139CL10
193,31,"Camilo genuinely wanted to escape, but it was too late. Rita, serpentlike, had encircled him, embraced him, squeezed him until his bones cracked and dripped venom in his mouth. He was dazed and defeated. Shame, fear, remorse, desire—he felt all of them, but the battle was brief and the victory divine. Farewell, scruples!",CO139CL10
194,32,"It did not take long for the shoe to mold itself to the foot, and off they went on their merry way, arm in arm, skipping lightly over grass and pebbles, suffering nothing more than a few pangs of regret, for the moments when they were apart. Meanwhile, Vilela’s trust and affection remained unchanged.",CO139CL10
195,33,"One day, however, Camilo received an anonymous letter calling him immoral and perfidious, and saying that the affair was public knowledge. Camilo was afraid and, hoping to divert suspicion, he began to visit Vilela’s house less frequently. His friend commented on his absence.",CO139CL10
196,34,"Camilo gave as his reason a frivolous youthful passion. Innocence bred ingenuity. Camilo’s absences grew longer and longer, until his visits ceased completely. A little amour propre may have played its part too; a desire to escape the husband’s kindnesses and thus alleviate the burden of his treachery.",CO139CL10
197,35,"It was around this time that Rita, feeling fearful and suspicious, went off to consult the fortune-teller about the real reason for Camilo’s behavior. As we have seen, the fortune-teller entirely restored Rita’s faith in Camilo, and Camilo scolded her for going there in the first place. Several weeks went by. Camilo received two or three more anonymous letters, so passionate that they could not be considered mere sanctimonious warnings, but rather the bitter outpourings of a rival. That was Rita’s view, and she, somewhat less succinctly, formulated the following thought: “Virtue is niggardly and lazy, wasting neither paper nor time; only self-interest is spendthrift and diligent.”",CO139CL10
198,36,"Not that this was of any comfort to Camilo; he feared the anonymous letter-writer would go to Vilela, and then catastrophe would be inevitable. Rita agreed that this was a possibility.",CO139CL10
199,37,"“Very well, then,” she said, “I will take the envelopes home with me and compare them to the handwriting on every letter that arrives. If any arrive bearing the same handwriting, I’ll tear them up.”",CO139CL10
200,38,"No such letters appeared, but shortly afterward, Vilela grew suddenly somber and taciturn, as if he suspected something. Rita rushed to tell Camilo, and they pondered what to do. Rita felt that Camilo should begin visiting their house again and sound out her husband: it might well be that Vilela would confide in him some business matter that was troubling him.",CO139CL10
201,39,"Camilo disagreed: appearing suddenly after so many months would only confirm any suspicion or accusation. Better to lie low and forgo each other’s company for a few weeks. They agreed on how they would communicate in case of necessity, and separated tearfully.",CO139CL10
202,40,"The following day, at the department, Camilo received the following note from Vilela: “Come to our house immediately; I need to speak to you at once.” It was already after midday. Camilo did not hesitate, but once in the street, it occurred to him that it would have been more natural for Vilela to summon him to his office—why to his house? Everything indicated that something grave had happened, and, although he may have been imagining it, the handwriting did look shaky. He put all this together with what Rita had told him the previous day.",CO139CL10
203,41,"“Come to our house immediately; I need to speak to you at once,” he repeated to himself, his eyes fixed on the piece of paper.",CO139CL10
204,42,"In his imagination he sketched the climactic scene of a drama: Rita tearful and defeated, Vilela angrily grabbing his pen and scribbling the note, certain that Camilo would come, then sitting there waiting to kill him. Camilo shuddered. He felt afraid, but then he smiled through clenched teeth and carried on walking, for he found the idea of retreating utterly repugnant. On the way, it occurred to him to call in at home first—there might be a message from Rita explaining everything. There was no message and no messenger.",CO139CL10
205,43,"Back in the street, the notion that they had been discovered seemed to him ever more plausible; the most likely thing was an anonymous informer, maybe even the same person who had threatened him previously. Perhaps Vilela knew everything. Calling off his visits, on only the flimsiest of pretexts, would only have confirmed what he now knew.",CO139CL10
206,44,"Camilo carried on walking, anxious and agitated. He didn’t read the note again, but he knew the words by heart, they were there before his eyes, or, worse still, he could hear them whispered in his ear, in Vilela’s own voice. “Come to our house immediately; I need to speak to you at once.” Spoken like that, in the other man’s voice, they had an air of mystery and menace. Come immediately—but why? It was nearly one o’clock. His agitation was growing by the minute.",CO139CL10
207,45,"So vivid was his imagination of what would happen that he came to believe it and even see it there before him. By now he really was afraid. He began to think about taking a gun, since if it turned out there was no reason to worry he would still have nothing to lose, and it would be a sensible precaution. However, he quickly dismissed the idea, annoyed with himself for even thinking of it, and carried on, walking more quickly as he approached the cab rank in Largo da Carioca. He climbed in and told the driver to set off at full speed.",CO139CL10

209,47,"But the horse’s steady trotting only served to discomfit him further. Time was flying and very soon he would find himself face-to-face with danger. Almost at the end of Rua da Guarda Velha, the cab came to a halt, because the street was blocked by an overturned cart. Camilo privately welcomed the obstruction and waited. After five minutes, he noticed that just a few steps away, on the left-hand side of the street, stood the house of the fortune-teller—the same one Rita had once consulted. Never before had he wished so fervently to believe in what the cards had said.",CO139CL10
210,48,"He looked up at the windows of the house, all firmly shut, while every other window in the street was flung wide and crammed with curious onlookers. It appeared every bit the home of indifferent Fate.",CO139CL10
211,49,"Camilo leaned back in his seat, not wanting to see any more. He was by now extraordinarily agitated, and rising up from the innermost depths of his moral being came his old beliefs and superstitions, the ghosts of times gone by. The cabdriver suggested they turn around and take the first side street; he, however, said he would rather wait, and again leaned forward to look up at the house. Then he made an incredulous gesture, unable to believe the thought that had just occurred to him, namely, the idea of consulting the fortune-teller, an idea that flapped past him in the far distance on vast gray wings, disappearing, then reappearing, and once again fading from view; then, moments later, the wings flapped past him again, this time circling ever closer . . . In the street, men were shouting as they struggled to move the cart:",CO139CL10
212,50,“Push! Push! Keep going!”,CO139CL10
213,51,"Soon the obstruction would be cleared. Camilo closed his eyes, his mind on other things, but the voice of Rita’s husband was whispering the words of the letter in his ear. “Come immediately . . .”",CO139CL10
214,52,"And, trembling, he could see before him the twists and turns of the unfolding drama. The house was looking at him. His legs wanted to get out of the cab and go in. Camilo found himself confronted by a long, heavy veil; his mind rapidly reviewed the many things in life that defy explanation. His mother’s voice gave him a long litany of extraordinary events, and that same saying of the Prince of Denmark echoed inside him: “There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” What did he have to lose . . . ?",CO139CL10
215,53,"He found himself on the sidewalk, outside the street door. He told the cabdriver to wait, darted into the hallway and went up the stairs. There was little light, the steps were badly worn, and the handrail sticky, but he didn’t see or feel any of these things. He continued on up and knocked. When no one answered, he considered leaving, but it was too late, curiosity was beating in his veins, and his temples throbbed; he knocked again, once, twice, three times. A woman came; it was the fortune-teller. Camilo said he had come to consult her and she ushered him in.",CO139CL10
216,54,"They went up to the attic, by way of a staircase even darker and more decrepit than the last. Upstairs there was a small room, poorly lit by a single window that looked out over the backs of the houses.",CO139CL10
217,55,"The shabby furniture, stained walls, and the general air of poverty all served to increase rather than destroy the power and mystery of the place.",CO139CL10
218,56,"The fortune-teller told him to sit down at the table, while she sat on the other side with her back to the window, so that what little light entered the room fell on Camilo’s face.",CO139CL10
219,57,"She opened a drawer and took out a deck of long, grubby, dog-eared cards. As she rapidly shuffled the cards, she was studying him, not directly, but furtively from beneath heavy eyelids.",CO139CL10
220,58,"She was a woman of about forty, an Italian, thin and swarthy, with large, sly, astute eyes. She turned over three cards on the table and said:",CO139CL10
221,59,"“First, we shall see what has brought you here. You are very afraid . . .” Camilo nodded in amazement.",CO139CL10
222,60,"“And you want to know,” she continued, “whether or not something will happen to you . . .”",CO139CL10
223,61,"“To me and to her,” he explained enthusiastically.",CO139CL10
224,62,"The fortune-teller did not smile; she simply told him to wait. She scooped up the cards and shuffled them again with her long tapering fingers, their nails untrimmed and neglected. She shuffled the cards thoroughly and cut the pack once, twice, three times; then she began to lay them out. Camilo watched her with anxious, curious eyes",CO139CL10
225,63,“The cards tell me . . .”,CO139CL10
226,64,"Camilo leaned forward to drink in her words one by one. She told him he had nothing to fear. Nothing would happen to either of them; the third party suspected nothing. It was nevertheless vital to exercise caution, for there was much simmering envy and resentment. She spoke of the love that bound them, of Rita’s beauty . . . Camilo was amazed. The fortune-teller finished, gathered up the cards, and locked them away in the drawer.",CO139CL10
227,65,"“You have restored my peace of mind,” he said, reaching across the table and grasping her hand in his.",CO139CL10
228,66,She stood up and laughed.,CO139CL10
229,67,"“Off you go then,” she said, “ragazzo innamorato . . .”",CO139CL10
230,68,"Standing over him, she touched his forehead with her index finger. Camilo shuddered as if it were the hand of the Sibyl herself, then he, too, stood up. The fortune-teller went over to the chest of drawers, on which there stood a bowl of raisins. She picked up a handful and began eating the raisins, revealing two rows of white teeth in sharp contrast with the state of her nails. Even when doing something so ordinary, the woman had about her a most unusual air. Camilo was keen to leave, but had no idea how he should pay, or how much.",CO139CL10
231,69,"“Raisins cost money,” he said at last, taking out his wallet. “How many do you want to send for?”",CO139CL10
232,70,"“The answer is in your heart,” she replied.",CO139CL10
233,71,Camilo took out a ten-mil-réis note and gave it to her. The fortune-teller’s eyes lit up. The usual fee was two mil-réis.,CO139CL10
234,72,"“I can see you love her very much . . . And you’re quite right, for she loves you very much too. Off you go, it will all be fine. Watch out on the stairs, though, it’s dark. And put your hat on . . .”",CO139CL10
235,73,"The fortune-teller had already slipped the money into her pocket. She accompanied him down the stairs, talking with a slight Italian accent. Camilo said goodbye to her on the landing and went down to the street, while the fortune-teller, delighted with the ten mil-réis, returned to the attic, humming a Venetian barcarola. Camilo found the cab waiting; the traffic was moving again. He climbed in and they set off at a fast trot.",CO139CL10
236,74,"Everything seemed better now. Things took on a different aspect: the sky was clear and the faces about him beamed. He even managed to laugh at his own fears, which he now found puerile; he remembered the words of Vilela’s letter and saw in them merely the familiarity of a close friend. What on earth had he found threatening about them? He also noticed the urgency of the message, and that he had been wrong to take so long: it could well be some terribly serious business matter.",CO139CL10
237,75,"“As fast as you can!” he said to the cabdriver, several times.",CO139CL10
238,76,"He thought up some story to explain the delay to his friend; it seems he also devised a plan to take advantage of the situation and resume his regular visits . . . Meanwhile, the fortune-teller’s words still echoed in his soul. After all, she had foreseen the reason for his visit, his current predicament, the existence of a third party; why wouldn’t she also be able to foresee everything else? After all, the unknown present is as much of an enigma as the future. And so, slowly but surely, his former beliefs and superstitions took hold of him once again, and mystery gripped him in its iron claws. At times he wanted to laugh, and he did laugh at himself, somewhat shamefacedly; but the woman, the cards, her brief yet reassuring words, her final exhortation—",CO139CL10
239,77,"“Off you go then, ragazzo innamorato”—and finally, in the distance, her slow, lilting farewell barcarola, all these were the new elements which, combined with the old ones, formed the basis of a new and vigorous faith.",CO139CL10
240,78,"The truth is that his heart was cheerful and impatient, thinking about happy times gone by, and those to come. As he passed through Glória, Camilo gazed across the water, staring out to where sea and sky clasp each other in an infinite embrace, and he sensed before him a long, long unending future.",CO139CL10
241,79,"Shortly afterward, he arrived at Vilela’s house. He got out of the cab and pushed open the iron gate into the garden. The house was silent. He climbed the six stone steps and barely had time to knock when the door opened and Vilela appeared.",CO139CL10
242,80,"“Sorry, I couldn’t get here any sooner. What’s happened?”",CO139CL10
243,81,"Vilela did not reply; he looked almost deranged. He beckoned to Camilo, and led him to a small room off the parlor. When he entered, Camilo could not suppress a terrified scream: there, on the sofa, lay Rita, dead and drenched in blood. Vilela then grabbed Camilo by the throat and, with two shots from his revolver, laid him out dead on the floor.",CO139CL10

245,2,"Garcia, on foot, was clicking his fingernails and watching; Fortunato, in the rocking chair, was looking at the ceiling; Maria Luísa, by the window, was finishing some needlework.",CO162CL08
246,3,"It had been five minutes since any of them had said anything. They had talked about the day, which had been excellent, about Catumbi, where Fortunato and his wife’s house was, and about a sanatorium, which we shall return to. Since the three individuals present here are now dead and buried, it’s time to tell the story plainly.",CO162CL08
247,4,"They had talked as well about something besides those three things, something so horrible and serious that it left them feeling not much like discussing the day, the neighborhood, and the sanatorium. The entire conversation, in this respect, was forced.",CO162CL08
248,5,"Just now, Maria Luísa’s hands seem to be shaking still, and Garcia’s face has taken on an expression of severity that is unusual in him. In reality, what happened was of such a nature that to make it comprehensible it’s necessary to go back to the origin of the situation.",CO162CL08
249,6,"Garcia had become a doctor the year before, in 1861. In 1860, still in school, he met Fortunato, for the first time, at the door to Santa Casa; he was on his way in and the other fellow was on his way out. His aspect made an impression on him; but, even so, he would have forgotten it had there not been a second encounter a few days later.",CO162CL08
250,7,"He lived on Rua de Dom Manoel. One of his rare pastimes was to go to the theater of São Januário, which was nearby, between that street and the beach; he would go once or twice a month, and he would never find more than forty people. Only the most intrepid dared walk as far as that corner of the city. One night, when he was already in his seat, Fortunato turned up and sat down next to him.",CO162CL08
251,8,"The play was a rough-hewn melodrama, bristling with oaths and reproaches, but Fortunato was listening to it with odd interest. In the sad scenes, his listened with even greater attention, and his eyes darted avidly from one character to the other, to the point that the student suspected that in the play there were personal reminiscences of his neighbor’s.",CO162CL08
252,9,"After the melodrama came a farce, but Fortunato didn’t stay for it. Garcia went out after him. Fortunato took Beco do Cotovelo, Rua de São José, to the Largo da Carioca. He was walking slowly, head down, stopping now and then to give some sleeping dog a caning; the dog was left crying, and he would go his way.",CO162CL08
253,10,In the Largo da Carioca he got in a tilbury and headed for the area of Praça da Constituição. Garcia turned back for home with finding out anything more.,CO162CL08
254,11,"Several weeks went by. One night—it was nine o’clock—he was at home when he heard voices on the stairs; he went right down from his garret to the second floor, where an employee at the war arsenal lived.",CO162CL08
255,12,"It was this man who, bloodied, was being taken up the stairs by several men.",CO162CL08
256,13,"His black manservant came to open the door; the man was moaning, the voices were indistinct, the light dim. Once the wounded man was put to bed, Garcia said a doctor had to be called.",CO162CL08
257,14,"“One’s coming,” said someone.",CO162CL08
258,15,Garcia looked at him: it was the man from Santa Casa and the theater. He thought he might be a relative or a friend of the wounded man but changed his mind when he heard him ask him if he had family or someone close to him.,CO162CL08
259,16,"The black man told him he didn’t, and he took on the responsibility for his care, asked the people who were not from the house to leave, paid the porters, and gave the first orders. When he found out that Garcia was a neighbor and a medical student, he asked him to stay to help the doctor. Then he told him what happened.",CO162CL08
260,17,"“It was a gang of muggers. I was coming from the Moura Barracks, where I was visiting a cousin, when I heard a loud racket and then saw a crowd. They apparently wounded someone who was passing by and who turned into one of those alleys; but I saw only this gentleman, who was crossing the street when one of the muggers, brushing him, stabbed him. He didn’t fall right away; he said where he lived, and since it was right around the corner I thought it better to take him.”",CO162CL08
261,18,“Did you know him before?” asked Garcia.,CO162CL08
262,19,"“No, I’ve never seen him. Who is he?”",CO162CL08
263,20,"“He’s a good fellow, an employee at the war arsenal. His name is Gouvêa.”",CO162CL08
264,21,“I don’t know who he is.”,CO162CL08
265,22,"A doctor and a deputy police chief came a little later; Gouvêa got treatment, and the men took down information. The stranger said that his name was Fortunato Gomes da Silveira, that he lived on a private income, was single and a resident of Catumbi. The wound was deemed serious. While the doctor, assisted by the student, treated Gouvêa, Fortunato served as an orderly, holding the basin, the candle, the dressings, without getting in the way at all, gazing coldly at the wounded man, who was moaning heavily.",CO162CL08
266,23,"In the end, he spoke in private with the doctor, accompanying him to the landing on the staircase, and he said again to the deputy police chief that he was willing to help the police with their investigation. The two men left; he and the student remained in the room.",CO162CL08
267,24,"Garcia was astonished. He took a look at him, saw him sit down unworriedly, stretch his legs, put his hands in his pants pockets, and look at the wounded man’s eyes. His eyes were clear, the color of lead; they moved slowly, and they had a hard, dry, and cold look.",CO162CL08
268,25,"A gaunt and pale face; a thin wisp of beard—short, reddish, and sparse—beneath his chin and going from one side of his head to the other. He must have been about forty. From time to time, he turned to the student and asked something about the wounded man; but then he went back to looking at him as the young fellow gave him his answer.",CO162CL08
269,26,"The feeling the student got was of repulsion and curiosity at the same time; he couldn’t deny that he was witnessing an act of unusual devotion, and if it was disinterested, as it seemed to be, there was nothing for it but to admit that the human heart was a well of mysteries.",CO162CL08
270,27,"Fortunato left after nearly an hour; he returned the following days, but the wound was getting better quickly, and before it had done so entirely he disappeared without telling the beneficiary of his concern where he lived. It was the student who gave him his name and address.",CO162CL08
271,28,"“I’m going to thank him for his help once I can get out,” the convalescent said.",CO162CL08
272,29,"He rushed to Catumbi six days later. Fortunato received him reluctantly, listened impatiently to his words of thanks, gave him an annoyed response, and ended up using the tails of his housecoat to take whacks at his knees. Gouvêa, in front of him, seated and quiet, smoothed his hat with his fingers, looking up now and then, not finding anything else to say. After ten minutes he begged his pardon and left.",CO162CL08
273,30,"“Watch out for muggers!” said the master of the house, laughing.",CO162CL08
274,31,"The poor devil left mortified, humiliated, having trouble stomaching the contempt, struggling to get it out of his mind, explain it, or forgive it so that only the memory of his gratitude would remain in his heart: in vain did he make the effort. Resentment, a new and exclusive guest, went in and kicked out gratitude in such a way that the unfortunate feeling had no choice but to go up to his head and shelter there as a mere idea. It was thus that the benefactor himself instilled a feeling of ingratitude in this man.",CO162CL08
275,32,"All of this astonished Garcia. This young fellow had a budding ability to decode men, to break people down into their component parts; he had a love for analysis, and he experienced the joy, which he called supreme, of making it through several moral layers to feel the secret of an organism.",CO162CL08
276,33,"His curiosity piqued, he thought about going to see the man from Catumbi, but he noted that he had not received a formal invitation to his house. At the very least he needed a pretext, and he couldn’t find one.",CO162CL08
277,34,"Some time later, having graduated and living on Rua de Mata-cavalos, near Rua do Conde, he ran into Fortunato in a gondola; he ran into him still other times, and the frequency led to familiarity. One day Fortunato asked him to come pay him a visit nearby, in Catumbi.",CO162CL08
278,35,“Did you know I’m married?”,CO162CL08
279,36,“I didn’t know.”,CO162CL08
280,37,"“I got married four months ago. Four days ago, you could say. Come have dinner with us this Sunday.”",CO162CL08
281,38,“Sunday?”,CO162CL08
282,39,“Don’t go begging off. I won’t let you. Come on Sunday.”,CO162CL08
283,40,"Garcia went on Sunday. Fortunato gave him a good dinner, good cigars, and good conversation, in the company of his wife, who was interesting. His look hadn’t changed: his eyes were the same sheets of tin, hard and cold. His other features were no more appealing than before.",CO162CL08
284,41,"Though they didn’t redeem his nature, his attentions nevertheless made for some compensation, and that was something. It was Maria Luísa whose person and manners were both charming.",CO162CL08
285,42,"She was willowy, graceful, with sweet and submissive eyes; she was twenty-five years old but didn’t look more than nineteen.",CO162CL08
286,43,"The second time he went there, Garcia noticed that there was a slight dissonance of character between them, little or no spiritual affinity, and in the woman’s dealings with her husband manners that went beyond respect and bordered on resignation and fear.",CO162CL08
287,44,"One day, when the three of them were together, Garcia asked Maria Luísa if she had heard how he had met her husband.",CO162CL08
288,45,"“No,” said the young woman.",CO162CL08
289,46,“You’re going to hear about a good deed.”,CO162CL08
290,47,"“It’s not worth it,” Fortunato put in.",CO162CL08
291,48,"“She’ll see if it’s worth it,” insisted the doctor.",CO162CL08
292,49,"He told the story of the Rua de Dom Manoel. The young woman listened to it in fright. Without realizing it, she held out her hand and, laughing and grateful, closed it around her husband’s wrist, as if she had just discovered his heart. Fortunato shrugged, but he didn’t listen indifferently.",CO162CL08
293,50,"In the end, he himself told the story of the visit the wounded man had paid him, with all of the particulars concerning the looks, the gestures, the unspoken words, the silences—in short, something extravagant. And he laughed a lot as he told it.",CO162CL08
294,51,It wasn’t the laughter of duplicity. Duplicity is evasive and oblique; his laughter was cheerful and frank.,CO162CL08
295,52,“A strange man!” thought Garcia.,CO162CL08
296,53,"Maria Luísa was upset by her husband’s mockery; but he gave her back her earlier contentment by telling her about his devotion and his uncommon attributes as a nurse; such a good nurse, he concluded, that if ever he opened a sanatorium he would ask him to work for him.",CO162CL08
297,54,“Really?” asked Fortunato.,CO162CL08
298,55,“Really what?”,CO162CL08
299,56,“Are we going to open a sanatorium?”,CO162CL08
300,57,“Not at all; I was joking.”,CO162CL08
301,58,"“Something could be done. And for you, beginning your practice, I think it would be pretty good. I happen to have a house that’s going to be empty, and it will do.”",CO162CL08
302,59,"Garcia declined that day and the next day, but the other man had gotten the idea into his head, and it was impossible to retreat. In truth, it was a good opportunity for him, and it could end up being good business for both of them. Several days later, he ended up agreeing, and it was a disappointment for Maria Luísa.",CO162CL08
303,60,"A frail and skittish creature, she suffered at the mere thought of her husband’s having to be in contact with human ailments, but she didn’t dare oppose him, and she bowed her head. Plans were made and carried out quickly.",CO162CL08
304,61,"The fact is that Fortunato would never take greater care of anything, neither then nor later. Once the sanatorium was opened, he became the manager of it and the supervisor of the nurses; he checked everything, made sure everything was in order, supplies and syrups, drugs and bills.",CO162CL08
305,62,Garcia saw then that the devotion to the wounded man of Rua Dom Manoel was not a random occurrence but an impulse rooted in this man’s very nature. He saw him working harder than any of the employees.,CO162CL08
306,63,"He shrank before nothing, felt no painful or disgusted annoyance, and was always up for everything, at any time of the day or night. Everybody was astonished and everybody applauded. Fortunato studied, was present for operations, and handled, he alone, the caustic acids.",CO162CL08
307,64,"“I really believe in caustic acids,” he would say.",CO162CL08
308,65,"The conjunction of their interests tightened the bonds of intimacy. Garcia became a familiar figure in the house; he had dinner there nearly every day, there he observed the character and life of Maria Luísa, whose moral loneliness was obvious. And loneliness seemed to heighten her charm.",CO162CL08
309,66,"Garcia started sensing that something was perturbing him when she appeared, when she spoke, when she worked quietly in the corner by the window or played sad music on the piano. Little by little, love made it into his heart.",CO162CL08
310,67,"When he noticed it, he tried to expel it so that no bond other than that of friendship would tie him to Fortunato, but he was unable to. All he could do was lock it up; Maria Luísa understood both things—the love and the silence—but gave no sign of doing so.",CO162CL08
311,68,"In early October an incident arose that opened the doctor’s eyes even more to the young woman’s situation. Fortunato had begun studying anatomy and physiology, and he whiled away his idle hours by cutting open and poisoning cats and dogs.",CO162CL08
312,69,"Since the animals’ cries disturbed the patients, he took his laboratory home, and his wife, of a nervous temperament, had to endure them.",CO162CL08
313,70,"One day, finally, unable to take it any longer, she went to see the doctor and asked him to get her husband, as if it were coming from him, to put an end to those experiments.",CO162CL08
314,71,“But you yourself. . . .”,CO162CL08
315,72,"“He’ll naturally think I’m being childish,” Maria Luísa replied with a smile. “What I’d like is for you, as a doctor, to tell him that it isn’t good for me; and believe me, it isn’t.”",CO162CL08
316,73,"Garcia soon got Fortunato to stop doing those experiments. If he went somewhere else to do them no one knows, but he may have. Maria Luísa thanked the doctor, for herself as well as for the animals, which she couldn’t watch suffer. She coughed every now and then. Garcia asked her if something was wrong; she said there was nothing.",CO162CL08
317,74,“Let me check your pulse.”,CO162CL08
318,75,“I don’t have anything.”,CO162CL08
319,76,"She left without offering her wrist. Garcia remained apprehensive. He thought, on the contrary, that she might have something, that it was necessary to check her and let her husband know in time.",CO162CL08
320,77,"Two days later—the very day we are seeing them now—Garcia went over for dinner. In the parlor he was told that Fortunato was in the study, and he headed in that direction; he was nearing the door just as Maria Luísa came out in tears.",CO162CL08
321,78,“What is it?” he asked her.,CO162CL08
322,79,"“The rat! The rat!” burst out the young woman, gasping for breath and moving away.",CO162CL08
323,80,Garcia remembered that he had heard Fortunato complaining the evening before about a rat that had taken an important sheet of paper from him; but he was far from expecting what he saw. He saw Fortunato seated at the desk in the middle of the study and on which he had put a dish full of spirits. The liquid was flaming.,CO162CL08
324,81,"Between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand he was holding a piece of twine, from the end of which, tied by the tail, was hanging the rat. In his right hand he had a pair of scissors. Just as Garcia went in, Fortunato snipped off one of the rat’s legs; then he lowered the rat into the flame, quickly, to keep from killing it, and made ready to do the same with the third leg, since he had already snipped off the first one. Garcia froze in horror.",CO162CL08
325,82,“Kill it now!” he said to him.,CO162CL08
326,83,“Just a second.”,CO162CL08
327,84,"And with a singular smile, the reflection of a contented soul, something that revealed inner delectation of superlative feeling, Fortunato cut off the rat’s third leg and for the third time lowered the rat into the flame. The wretched creature writhed, screeching, bloodied, scorched, and still wouldn’t die.",CO162CL08
328,85,"Garcia looked away, then looked back and put out his hand to put a stop to the torture but didn’t manage to because, with all that serenity radiating from his face, that devil of man inspired fear.",CO162CL08
329,86,"There was still the last leg to cut off; Fortunato cut it off very slowly, and he went on gazing at the half-dead rat. On lowering it into the flame for the fourth time, he did so even more quickly, to save, if possible, a few scraps of life.",CO162CL08
330,87,"Garcia, in front of him, managed to overcome the repugnance of the sight to look at the man’s face. Neither rage nor hatred; just immense pleasure, calm and profound, such as another person would get from listening to a beautiful sonata or from the sight of a celestial statue, something like a pure aesthetic sensation.",CO162CL08
331,88,"It seemed to him—and it was true—that Fortunato had completely forgotten him. As such, he couldn’t be faking, and he had to be exactly as he seemed. The flame was dying down; the rat, shadow of a shadow, might still have had a residue of life left in it. Fortunato took advantage of the chance to cut its snout off and to put the flesh in the fire for the last time.",CO162CL08
332,89,"In the end, he dropped the cadaver into the dish and pushed all that mixture of blood and scorched flesh away.",CO162CL08
333,90,"When he got up he saw the doctor and started. He then showed himself to be angry at the animal that had eaten his sheet of paper, but his anger was obviously feigned.",CO162CL08
334,91,"“He punishes without anger,” thought the doctor, “out of a need for a feeling of pleasure that the pain of others alone can give him: it’s this man’s secret.”",CO162CL08
335,92,"Fortunato stressed the importance of the piece of paper, the trouble the loss of it caused him, a waste of time, to be sure, but time was most precious to him now. Garcia just listened, without saying anything or believing him.",CO162CL08
336,93,"He recalled the man’s deeds, the serious ones and the trivial ones, and came up with the same explanation for them all. It was the same change of the keys of human feeling, a connoisseurship of its own kind, a concentration of Caligula.",CO162CL08
337,94,"When Maria Luísa returned to the study a bit later, her husband went over to her with a laugh, took her hands, and spoke gently to her:",CO162CL08
338,95,“Sissy!”,CO162CL08
339,96,And turning to the doctor:,CO162CL08
340,97,“Can you believe she almost fainted?”,CO162CL08
341,98,"Mari Luísa defended her fear, said she was nervous and a woman; then she went to sit down by the window with her wool and her needles, and her hands were still shaking, as we saw at the beginning of this story. You will remember that after having spoken about other things the three of them went quiet, the husband seated and looking at the ceiling, the doctor clicking his fingernails.",CO162CL08
342,99,"They ate a little later, but dinner was not cheerful. Maria Luísa brooded and coughed; the doctor asked himself if she might not be exposed to some excess in the company of such a man. It was only a possibility, but love turned it from a possibility into a certainty; he trembled for her and made up his mind to keep an eye on them.",CO162CL08
343,100,"She coughed, coughed, and it wasn’t long before the sickness removed its mask. It was consumption, the voracious old lady who sucks out life until nothing but bone residue is left. For Fortunato, the news was a blow; he truly loved his wife, after his fashion, was used to her, found it hard to lose her. He spared no effort: doctors, medicines, changes of air, every resource and every therapy. But all was in vain. The disease was deadly.",CO162CL08
344,101,"In the last days, in the presence of the young woman’s most terrible sufferings, the husband’s nature overpowered every other fancy. He no longer left her side: he turned his lusterless and cold eye on that slow and painful decomposition of life, drank in one after the other the tribulations of that lovely creature, now gaunt and glassy, consumed by fever and hollowed out by death.",CO162CL08
345,102,"A most gruesome selfishness, hungry for sensations, he didn’t forgive her a single minute of her death throes or shed in return a single tear, public or private. Only when she died did he find himself stunned. Regaining his composure, he saw he was alone again.",CO162CL08
346,103,"At night, once a relative of Maria Luísa’s, who had come to help her die, had gone to bed, Fortunato and Garcia, both lost in thought, stayed in the room holding a wake over the body; but the husband was tired, and the doctor told him to get a little rest.",CO162CL08
347,104,“Go lie down. Sleep for an hour or two and then I’ll go.”,CO162CL08
348,105,"Fortunato left, went to lie down on the couch in the adjoining parlor, and fell asleep right away. Twenty minutes later he woke up, tried to get back to sleep, nodded off for a few minutes, and finally got up and returned to the living room. He walked on tiptoe to keep from waking up the relative, who was sleeping nearby. At the door, he stopped in astonishment.",CO162CL08
349,106,"Garcia had gone over to the body, lifted the shroud, and been gazing for a few seconds on the dead features. Then, as if death were spiritualizing everything, he bent over and kissed her on the head. It was just then that Fortunato reached the door.",CO162CL08
350,107,"He stopped in astonishment. It couldn’t be a friendly kiss; it was the epilogue to an adulterous book. Let it be known: he wasn’t jealous. Nature had made him in such a way that he felt neither jealousy nor envy but vanity, which is no less prey to resentment. He watched in astonishment, stewing in spite.",CO162CL08
351,108,"In the meantime, Garcia bent over again to give the body another kiss, but he couldn’t hold it back then. The kiss exploded into sobs, tears of silenced love, and irremediable despair. Fortunato, in the doorway, where he had remained, calmly savored this explosion of moral pain, which was long, very long, delightfully long.",CO162CL08

353,2,"Garcia was standing, staring at his fingernails and cracking his knuckles from time to time; Fortunato, in a rocking chair, looked at the ceiling; Maria Luisa, near the window, was finishing off some needlework.",CO162CL04
354,3,"For five minutes none of them had said a thing. They’d talked about the weather, which had been very pleasant – about Catumbi, where Fortunato and his wife lived, and about a private hospital, something we’ll explain later. As all three characters here present are now dead and buried, it’s time the story was told with no holds barred.",CO162CL04
355,4,"They had talked about something else too, something so serious, so nasty, that they hardly had the heart to talk about the weather, the neighbourhood and the hospital. Embarrassment held them back.",CO162CL04
356,5,"Even now, Maria Luisa’s fingers look as if they’re trembling, while Garcia’s face wears a severe expression, unusually for him. In fact, the nature of what had happened was such that to understand it we’ll have to take the story back to its beginnings.",CO162CL04
357,6,"Garcia had graduated in medicine in the previous year, 1861. In 1860, when he was still a student, he met Fortunato for the first time, in the doorway of the Santa Casa hospital; as he was going in, the other man was coming out. Fortunato’s appearance made an impression; even so he would have forgotten him if it hadn’t been for the second encounter a few days later.",CO162CL04
358,7,"Garcia was living in the Rua de Dom Manuel. One of his few amusements was to go to the São Januário theatre, which was nearby, between the street and the bay; he went once or twice a month – there were never more than forty people in the audience. Only the most intrepid ventured as far as that part of town. One night, when he’d taken his seat, Fortunato came in and sat next to him.",CO162CL04
359,8,"The play was a melodrama, clumsily put together, bristling with daggers, curses and pangs of conscience; but Fortunato watched with a singular interest. At painful moments, he was doubly attentive; his eyes eagerly went from one character to another, so intently that the student thought the play must be stirring personal memories.",CO162CL04
360,9,"The melodrama was followed by a farce; but Fortunato didn’t see it through; he left, and Garcia went after him. Fortunato went along the Beco do Cotovelo and the Rua de São José, as far as the Largo da Carioca. He walked slowly, head bent, stopping at times to thwack some sleeping dog with his cane; the dog would yelp, and he would go on his way.",CO162CL04
361,10,In the Largo da Carioca he got into a cab and went off towards the Praça da Constituição. Garcia went back home none the wiser.,CO162CL04
362,11,"Some weeks went by. One night, about nine o’clock, he was at home when he heard voices on the stairway; he went down from his lodgings at the top of the house to the first floor, where an employee of the Arsenal lived.",CO162CL04
363,12,"The man was being carried up the stairs, covered in blood.",CO162CL04
364,13,"His black servant hurried to open the door; he was groaning, and there was a confusion of voices in the semi-darkness. Once he’d been laid out on the bed, Garcia said they should call a doctor.",CO162CL04
365,14,"‘Here’s one,’ someone volunteered.",CO162CL04
366,15,Garcia looked: it was the man from the Santa Casa and the theatre. He thought he might be a relative or a friend of the patient; but discarded the notion when he heard him ask if the man had any family or a close friend nearby.,CO162CL04
367,16,"The servant said not. He then took charge of affairs, asked the strangers to leave, paid the people who had carried the man, and gave preliminary orders. Knowing Garcia was a neighbour and a medical student, he asked him to stay and help the doctor. Then he recounted what had happened.",CO162CL04
368,17,"‘It was a capoeira gang.1 I was coming from the Moura barracks where I’d been to visit a cousin when I heard shouting, and then a loud commotion. It seems they’d attacked another passer-by too, who disappeared up one of those alleyways; but I only saw this man – he was crossing the street when one of the gang brushed past, and knifed him. He didn’t fall to the ground straight away; he said where he lived, and as it was no distance away I thought it best to bring him back.’",CO162CL04
369,18,‘Did you know who he was?’,CO162CL04
370,19,"‘No, I’ve never seen him. Who is he?’",CO162CL04
371,20,"‘He’s a good fellow, an employee at the Arsenal. His name’s Gouveia.’",CO162CL04
372,21,‘I don’t know him.’,CO162CL04
373,22,"A doctor and a policeman arrived a short time later; his wounds were dressed, and information was taken. The unknown man said his name was Fortunato Gomes da Silveira; he was a bachelor, living off his investments, and came from Catumbi. They agreed the wound was serious. While the doctor was putting the dressings on, assisted by the student, Fortunato acted as servant, holding the bowl, the candle, the cloths, keeping out of the way, looking coldly at the patient, who was groaning out loud.",CO162CL04
374,23,"In the end, he had a private conversation with the doctor, accompanied him to the doorway leading to the staircase, and again told the officer he was ready to help the police with their investigation. The doctor and the policeman left, and Fortunato and the student stayed in the room.",CO162CL04
375,24,"Garcia was astonished. He looked at him, saw him calmly sit down, stretch out his legs, put his hands in his trouser pockets, and stare at the sick man. His eyes were pale, the colour of lead; they moved slowly, and had a hard, dry, cold expression.",CO162CL04
376,25,"His face was thin and pallid; there was a narrow strip of beard under the chin and from one temple to the other, short, reddish and sparse. He’d be about forty. From time to time, he turned round to the student and asked him something about the patient; but he soon turned back to look at him, in the middle of the young man’s answer.",CO162CL04
377,26,"Garcia felt repelled as well as curious; there was no denying he was witnessing an act of rare dedication, and if Fortunato was as disinterested as he seemed, the conclusion seemed to be that the human heart is a well of mysteries.",CO162CL04
378,27,"Fortunato left a little before one in the morning; he came back during the next few days, but the recovery was quick, and before it was complete he disappeared without telling the man where he lived. It was Garcia who gave him the name, the street and the number.",CO162CL04
379,28,"‘I’ll go and thank him for his kindness as soon as I can get out,’ said the convalescent.",CO162CL04
380,29,"Six days later, he hurried to Catumbi. Fortunato greeted him with embarrassment, listened impatiently to his words of thanks, replied in an offhand manner and ended up tapping the tassels of his dressing gown on his knee. Gouveia sat silently opposite him and smoothed his hat with his fingers, lifting his eyes from time to time, finding nothing else to say. After ten minutes, he begged leave, and left.",CO162CL04
381,30,"‘Steer clear of the capoeiras!’ Fortunato said, laughing.",CO162CL04
382,31,"The poor fellow came away exasperated, humiliated, chewing over the contempt he’d been treated with, struggling to forget it, explain it or forgive it, and let the favour itself dwell alone in his memory; but all in vain. Resentment, a new and exclusive lodger, moved in, and threw the favour out – all it could do was hide itself at the back of his brain, reduced to a mere idea. Thus it was that the benefactor himself prompted the feeling of ingratitude the man felt.",CO162CL04
383,32,"All this astonished Garcia. The young man had the beginnings of a capacity to decipher men’s characters and examine them; he was fond of analysing, and enjoyed the pleasure, than which he knew no greater, of cutting through many moral layers till he felt the living heart of an organism.",CO162CL04
384,33,"His curiosity was aroused, and he thought of going to Catumbi to see the man, but then he remembered he hadn’t even been formally invited. At the least he needed a pretext, and he couldn’t find one.",CO162CL04
385,34,"Some time later, after he’d graduated, and was living on the Rua de Mata-Cavalos, near the Rua do Conde, he met Fortunato on a horse-drawn bus, then ran into him a few more times, until they became familiar with one another. One day Fortunato invited him to go and visit him nearby, in Catumbi.",CO162CL04
386,35,‘You know I’ve married?’,CO162CL04
387,36,"‘No, I didn’t know.’",CO162CL04
388,37,‘I got married four months ago; it seems like four days. Come and have dinner with us on Sunday.’,CO162CL04
389,38,‘Sunday?’,CO162CL04
390,39,‘Don’t be making up excuses; I’ll have none of it. Come on Sunday.’,CO162CL04
391,40,"Garcia went on the Sunday. Fortunato gave him a good dinner, good cigars and good conversation, in the company of his wife, who was an interesting woman. His appearance hadn’t changed; his eyes were the same tin plates, hard and cold; his other features were no more attractive than before.",CO162CL04
392,41,"However, if the welcome didn’t exactly compensate for the nature of the man, it made up for it somewhat, and made a difference. Maria Luisa charmed him, both in her manners and in herself.",CO162CL04
393,42,"She was slim, graceful, with soft, submissive eyes; she was twenty-five, but looked no more than nineteen.",CO162CL04
394,43,"Garcia, the second time he went there, saw that there was a kind of lack of harmony in their characters, little or no moral affinity, and on the woman’s side there were some signs of feelings that went beyond respect, and looked more like resignation or fear.",CO162CL04
395,44,"One day, when the three of them were together, Garcia asked Maria Luisa if she’d been informed of how he had met her husband.",CO162CL04
396,45,"‘No,’ the young woman replied.",CO162CL04
397,46,‘Get ready to hear about a good deed.’,CO162CL04
398,47,"‘It’s not worth telling,’ Fortunato interrupted.",CO162CL04
399,48,"‘You’ll see whether it’s worth telling or not,’ the doctor insisted.",CO162CL04
400,49,"He told the story of the Rua de Dom Manuel. She listened, astonished. Instinctively, she stretched out her hand and grasped her husband’s wrist, grateful and smiling, as if she’d just discovered his heart. Fortunato shrugged his shoulders, but he wasn’t unmoved.",CO162CL04
401,50,"He himself then told the story of Gouveia’s visit, with all the details of his appearance, his gestures, the words struggling to get out, the silences – he was a halfwit, in fact.",CO162CL04
402,51,He laughed a lot as he told the story. It wasn’t false laughter either. Falsity is evasive and oblique; his laughter was jovial and open.,CO162CL04
403,52,‘Strange man!’ thought Garcia.,CO162CL04
404,53,"Maria Luisa was upset by her husband’s raillery; but the doctor brought back her previous happiness by retelling the story of Fortunato’s dedication, and his rare qualities as a nurse; such a good nurse, he concluded, that if one day I set up a private hospital, I’ll take him on.",CO162CL04
405,54,‘Shall we?’ asked Fortunato.,CO162CL04
406,55,‘Shall we what?’,CO162CL04
407,56,‘Let’s set up a hospital.’,CO162CL04
408,57,"‘No, no, I’m only joking.’",CO162CL04
409,58,"‘We could do something; and for you, just starting out on your career, I think it’d be ideal. I’ve got a house that’s coming vacant, just the thing.’",CO162CL04
410,59,"Garcia refused then, and the next day; but the idea had got into Fortunato’s head, and there was no going back. True, it was a good start for him, and might be a money-maker for both. Finally, a few days later, he accepted, to Maria Luisa’s disappointment.",CO162CL04
411,60,"A nervous, fragile creature, she suffered at the mere notion of her husband being in daily contact with human disease, but she dared not oppose him, and bowed to the inevitable. The plans were quickly laid and carried out.",CO162CL04
412,61,"It must be said that Fortunato thought about nothing else, then or later. When the hospital was open he was the administrator and chief nurse, inspected everything, organised everything, stores and soups, pills and accounts.",CO162CL04
413,62,Then Garcia was able to observe that the dedication to Gouveia was not an isolated case; it was inherent in the man’s very nature. He watched him carry out his duties with more dedication than the servants themselves.,CO162CL04
414,63,"He flinched at nothing; there was no disease too painful or repellent; he was ready for anything, at any time of the day or night. Everyone was amazed and delighted. Fortunato studied and followed the operations, and no one else was allowed to apply the caustics.",CO162CL04
415,64,"‘I’ve a lot of faith in caustics,’ he’d say.",CO162CL04
416,65,"Their common interest brought them closer together. Garcia was always at their house; he dined there almost every day, observing Maria Luisa’s character and her life, as her moral solitude became more obvious. The solitude only seemed to double her charms.",CO162CL04
417,66,"Garcia began to notice that he felt uneasy when she appeared, when she spoke, when she was silently working by the window, or playing some sad tune on the piano. Softly, slowly, love entered his heart.",CO162CL04
418,67,"When he realised what was happening he tried to blot it out, so there should be nothing other than friendship between him and Fortunato: but he couldn’t. All he could do was shut it in; Maria Luisa saw both the affection and the silence, but she didn’t let it show.",CO162CL04
419,68,"At the beginning of October something happened that made the young woman’s situation even clearer to Garcia. Fortunato had started studying anatomy and physiology, and spent his spare time poisoning cats and dogs and cutting them up.",CO162CL04
420,69,"As the animals’ squeals unnerved the patients, he moved his laboratory to their house, and his wife, with her nervous disposition, had to put up with them.",CO162CL04
421,70,"One day, however, unable to bear it any longer, she went to Garcia and asked him, as a favour to her, to get her husband to stop these experiments.",CO162CL04
422,71,‘But you yourself …’,CO162CL04
423,72,"Maria Luisa replied with a smile: ‘Of course, he’d say I’m a child. What I want is for you, as a doctor, to tell him that it’s doing me harm; and it is, believe me …’",CO162CL04
424,73,"Garcia easily got Fortunato to give up these studies. If he continued them elsewhere, nobody found out; maybe he did. Maria Luisa thanked the doctor, for her own sake and that of the animals, for she couldn’t bear to see suffering. She coughed from time to time; Garcia asked if there was anything wrong with her; she said no.",CO162CL04
425,74,‘Hold out your wrist.’,CO162CL04
426,75,‘There’s nothing the matter.’,CO162CL04
427,76,"She didn’t give him her wrist, and left the room. Garcia felt concerned. On the contrary, he thought, maybe there was something wrong, and her husband ought to be warned in time.",CO162CL04
428,77,"Two days later – just the day we first came across them, in fact – Garcia went there to dine. In the parlour, they told him Fortunato was in the study, and he headed that way; as he got near the door, Maria Luisa was coming out, in distress.",CO162CL04
429,78,‘What is it?’ he asked.,CO162CL04
430,79,"‘The mouse! the mouse!’ the young woman exclaimed in a stifled voice, leaving hurriedly.",CO162CL04
431,80,"Garcia remembered that, the day before, he’d heard Fortunato complaining about a mouse that had chewed some important piece of paper; but he was far from expecting what he saw. He saw Fortunato sitting at the table, in the middle of the study, on which he had placed a saucer filled with alcohol. The burning liquid flickered.",CO162CL04
432,81,"Between his thumb and index finger he held a piece of string, tied round the mouse’s tail. In his right hand he held a pair of scissors. At the moment Garcia came in, Fortunato cut one of the mouse’s legs off; then he lowered the poor beast into the flame, quickly, so as not to kill it, and started to do the same with the third leg; he’d already cut one off. Garcia stopped in his tracks, horrified.",CO162CL04
433,82,‘Kill it at once!’ he said.,CO162CL04
434,83,‘Any minute now.’,CO162CL04
435,84,"And with an inimitable smile, the true reflection of a contented soul as it savoured inwardly the most delicious of sensations, Fortunate cut the third leg off the mouse, and for the third time lowered it into the flame. The miserable animal twisted this way and that, squealing, bleeding, scorched, and still it didn’t die.",CO162CL04
436,85,"Garcia averted his eyes, then looked again, and held out his hand to stop the torture, but he couldn’t, because this man, with the radiant serenity of his features, inspired fear.",CO162CL04
437,86,"There was one leg left; Fortunato cut it very slowly, following the scissors with his eyes; the leg fell off, and he stopped to look at the half-dead mouse. As he lowered it for the fourth time to the flame, he did it deftly, so as to save, if possible, any shred of life.",CO162CL04
438,87,"Garcia, facing him, managed to control his disgust at the spectacle and observe the man’s expression. No anger, no hatred; just a vast pleasure, quiet and profound; what you might get from hearing a beautiful sonata, or looking at a perfect piece of sculpture – something like a pure aesthetic sensation.",CO162CL04
439,88,"It seemed to him, rightly, that Fortunato had completely forgotten he was there. If that was true, he couldn’t be play-acting – this was the real thing. The flame was dying, the mouse might possibly have a little life left in it, the shadow of a shade; Fortunato turned it to good account by cutting off its nose and again lowering the flesh to the fire.",CO162CL04
440,89,"Finally, he let the body drop into the saucer, and pushed the mixture of blood and burned skin away.",CO162CL04
441,90,"When he got up, he saw the doctor and got a shock. He made a show of anger at the animal that had eaten his piece of paper, but it was obviously put on.",CO162CL04
442,91,"‘There’s no anger in the punishment,’ the doctor thought, ‘he does it out of the need for a pleasurable sensation, which can only be provided by another creature’s pain; that’s the man’s secret.’",CO162CL04
443,92,"Fortunato laid great stress on the importance of the piece of paper and what he’d lost – only time, admittedly, but time was very precious to him these days. Garcia just listened to him, not saying a word; he didn’t believe him for a moment.",CO162CL04
444,93,"He remembered his actions, trivial or not, and found the same explanation for all of them. It was as if the man’s sensibility had gone through a key-change, to a peculiar kind of dilettantism – he was a Caligula in miniature.",CO162CL04
445,94,"When Maria Luisa came back into the study, a little bit later, her husband went to her, took her hands and quietly said:",CO162CL04
446,95,‘Such a delicate little thing!’,CO162CL04
447,96,"And, turning to the doctor, he said:",CO162CL04
448,97,‘Can you believe she nearly fainted?’,CO162CL04
449,98,"Maria Luisa timidly defended herself, saying she was nervous and a woman, then went and sat by the window with her wool and her needles, her fingers still trembling, just as we found her at the beginning of the story. You’ll recall that, after they’d talked about other things, the three of them went quiet, the husband sitting and looking at the ceiling, the doctor cracking his knuckles.",CO162CL04
450,99,A little later they went to have dinner – but it wasn’t a happy occasion. Maria Luisa was brooding and coughing; the doctor was wondering if she might not be in some danger in the company of such a man. It was only a possibility; but love turned it into a certainty; he feared for her and determined to keep an eye on them.,CO162CL04
451,100,"She coughed and coughed, and it wasn’t long before the disease unmasked itself. It was tuberculosis, that insatiable old hag that sucks life away and leaves only the bones. It was a blow to Fortunato; he really loved his wife in his way, he was used to her, and losing her was a wrench. He spared no effort, doctors, medicines, a change of air, every possible expedient and palliative. But it was all in vain. She was mortally ill.",CO162CL04
452,101,"In the final days, as he watched the girl’s final struggle, her husband’s nature subdued any other passion. He never left her side; he fixed his cold, dull eyes on the slow, painful decomposition of life, drank in the beautiful creature’s afflictions one by one. She was thin, transparent, devoured by fever and riddled with death itself.",CO162CL04
453,102,"His exacerbated egotism, hungry for sensations, made him hang on every minute of her agony, nor did he pay for this with a single tear, public or private. Only when she died was he stunned. When he came back to his senses, he saw he was alone again.",CO162CL04
454,103,"At night, when a relative of Maria Luisa’s, who had assisted her while she was dying, went to rest, Fortunato and Garcia stayed in the room, keeping vigil, both of them lost in thought; but the husband was tired, and the doctor told him to go and rest awhile.",CO162CL04
455,104,"‘Go and lie down, have a couple of hours’ sleep: I’ll go later.’",CO162CL04
456,105,"Fortunato went out, lay down on the sofa in the next room, and soon went to sleep. Twenty minutes later he woke up, tried to go to sleep again, nodded off for a few minutes, then got up and went back to the sitting room. He went on tiptoes, so as not to wake the relative, who was sleeping nearby. When he got to the door, he stopped short, astonished.",CO162CL04
457,106,"Garcia had approached the body, lifted the veil and looked at her dead features for a few moments. Then, as if death had spiritualised everything, he bent over and kissed her on the forehead. That was when Fortunato came to the door.",CO162CL04
458,107,"He stopped short, astonished; it wasn’t a kiss of friendship – it might even be the epilogue of an adultery novel. He wasn’t jealous, be it noted; nature had made him in such a way that he was neither jealous nor envious, but it had made him vain, and no less subject to resentment than the next man. He looked on in shock, biting his lip.",CO162CL04
459,108,"Meanwhile, Garcia leaned over to kiss the dead body again, but he could control himself no longer. The kiss burst into sobs, the eyes couldn’t hold back the tears, which flowed thick and fast; the tears of silent love and irremediable despair. Fortunato, at the door, where he had stopped, quietly savoured this explosion of moral pain, which lasted a long, long, deliciously long time.",CO162CL04

461,2,"GARCIA WAS STANDING up, nervously picking at his fingernails; Fortunato, in the rocking chair, was gazing up at the ceiling; Maria Luísa, by the window, was finishing her needlework.",CO162CL10
462,3,"Five minutes had passed without any of them saying a word. They had talked about the weather, which had been excellent, about Catumbi, where Fortunato and his wife lived, and about a private hospital, but more of that later. Since the three people here described are all now dead and buried, the time has come to tell the unvarnished truth.",CO162CL10
463,4,"They had also talked about something else apart from those three subjects, a matter so serious and so distasteful that it left them with little appetite for discussing the weather, the neighborhood, or the hospital. The conversation on this subject had been very awkward indeed.",CO162CL10
464,5,"Even now, Maria Luísa’s fingers still seemed to be trembling, while Garcia’s face wore a stern expression, which for him was most unusual. The nature of what had happened was such that in order to understand it we must go back to the very beginning.",CO162CL10
465,6,"Garcia had qualified as a doctor the previous year, 1861. In 1860, while still at medical school, he had met Fortunato for the first time, at the entrance to the Santa Casa Hospital; he was going in as the other was leaving. Something about Fortunato impressed him, but he would have forgotten all about him had it not been for their second meeting a few days later.",CO162CL10
466,7,"Garcia lived in Rua Dom Manuel. One of his few amusements was to go to the Teatro de São Januário, which was close by, between his street and the waterfront; he went once or twice a month, and there were never more than forty or so spectators in the audience. Only the most intrepid souls dared venture down to that part of town. One night, he was sitting in the stalls, when Fortunato appeared and sat right next to him.",CO162CL10
467,8,"The play was an old melodrama, stitched together with stabbings and bristling with curses and wails of remorse; but Fortunato watched it with unusual interest. During the most painful scenes, he was doubly attentive; his eyes leapt from one character to another so intently that Garcia suspected that the play stirred some personal reminiscences in his neighbor.",CO162CL10
468,9,"The drama was followed by a farce, but Fortunato did not stay to see it; Garcia followed him out. Fortunato headed down Beco do Cotovelo and Rua de São José, as far as Largo da Carioca. He was walking slowly, shoulders hunched, stopping now and then to prod a sleeping dog with his cane; the dog would yelp, and Fortunato would carry on walking.",CO162CL10
469,10,At Largo da Carioca he got into a cab and headed off toward Praça da Constituição. Garcia returned home none the wiser.,CO162CL10
470,11,"Several weeks went by. He was at home one night when, at around nine o’clock, he heard the sound of voices on the stairs; he quickly left his attic lodgings and went down to the first floor, which was occupied by a man who worked at the War Arsenal.",CO162CL10
471,12,"The man in question was being carried upstairs, soaked in blood.",CO162CL10
472,13,"His black servant hurried to open the door; the man was groaning, the voices around him jumbled, the light dim. Once they’d laid the wounded man on the bed, Garcia said they should call a doctor.",CO162CL10
473,14,"“He’s on his way,” someone replied.",CO162CL10
474,15,"Garcia looked up: it was the same man he’d seen at the hospital and at the theater. He imagined him to be a friend or relative of the wounded man, but immediately rejected this idea when he heard him ask if the man had any family or next-of-kin.",CO162CL10
475,16,"The black man said no, and the stranger took control of the situation, asking the others to leave, paying the porters, and giving some initial instructions regarding the patient. On learning that Garcia was a neighbor and a medical student, he asked him to stay and assist the doctor. Then he explained what had happened.",CO162CL10
476,17,"“It was a gang of ruffians. I was coming back from the Moura Barracks where I’d been to visit a cousin, when I heard lot of shouting, and then some sort of scuffle. It seems they also wounded another passerby, who fled down one of the alleyways; but I only saw this gentleman, who was crossing the street when one of the ruffians brushed past him and stabbed him with a knife. He didn’t pass out immediately; he told me where he lived and, since it was only a few yards away, I thought it best to bring him here myself.”",CO162CL10
477,18,“Had you met him before?” asked Garcia.,CO162CL10
478,19,"“No, never laid eyes on him. Who is he?”",CO162CL10
479,20,"“He’s a good man, works at the War Arsenal. His name is Gouvêa.”",CO162CL10
480,21,“Never heard of him.”,CO162CL10
481,22,"The doctor and deputy superintendent arrived shortly afterward; bandages were applied and statements taken. The stranger gave his name as Fortunato Gomes da Silveira, a bachelor of independent means residing in Catumbi. The wound was deemed serious. While it was being dressed with Garcia’s assistance, Fortunato played the role of servant, holding the basin, the candle, and the bandages, not in the least disturbed, looking coldly down at the wounded man, who groaned constantly.",CO162CL10
482,23,"Afterward, he spoke privately with the doctor, accompanied him as far as the landing, and again assured the deputy superintendent that he stood ready to help the police with their inquiries. The doctor and deputy superintendent left; Fortunato and the student remained in the bedroom.",CO162CL10
483,24,"Garcia was astonished. He looked at the other man and watched him calmly sit down, stretch his legs, put his hands in his trouser pockets, and fix his gaze on the wounded man. His eyes were pale gray, the color of lead; they moved slowly and had a hard, cold, dry expression.",CO162CL10
484,25,"His face was thin and pale, framed by a wispy, ginger chinstrap beard. He was probably around forty. From time to time, he would turn to the student and ask something about the wounded man, then turn back to look at the patient while Garcia answered.",CO162CL10
485,26,"The young man’s feeling was one of revulsion mixed with curiosity; he couldn’t deny that he was witnessing an act of rare dedication, and if it was as selfless as it seemed, then he had to accept that the human heart was indeed a well of mysteries.",CO162CL10
486,27,"Fortunato left shortly before one o’clock; he returned during the days that followed, but the wound healed quickly, and, before it was completely healed, he disappeared without telling the object of his charity where he lived. It was Garcia who passed on Fortunato’s name, street, and house number.",CO162CL10
487,28,"“I’ll go and thank him for his kindness just as soon as I’m able to leave the house,” said the convalescent.",CO162CL10
488,29,"And six days later, he hurried over to Catumbi. Fortunato received him with some embarrassment, listened impatiently to his words of thanks, replied somewhat irritably, and ended up playing with the tassels on his dressing gown. Sitting silently in front of him, Gouvêa fiddled with his hat and looked up from time to time, unable to think of anything else to say. After ten minutes he took his leave.",CO162CL10
489,30,"“Watch out for those ruffians!” his host said, laughing.",CO162CL10
490,31,"The unfortunate fellow left the house feeling humiliated and mortified, resentful of the disdainful way in which he had been received. He struggled to forget, to explain or pardon, so that only the memory of the kind deed would remain in his heart, but all in vain. Resentment, a new, exclusive lodger, entered his heart and kicked out the kind deed, which, poor thing, had no alternative but to clamber up into his brain and seek refuge there as a mere idea. Thus it was that the benefactor instilled in the beneficiary a feeling of rank ingratitude.",CO162CL10
491,32,"All this astonished Garcia. The young man had a nascent ability to decipher men and deconstruct characters; he loved analysis and possessed the gift, which he prized above all others, of being able to penetrate numerous emotional and spiritual layers until he grasped the inner secret of a human organism.",CO162CL10
492,33,"His curiosity pricked, he considered going to see the man from Catumbi, but realized that he had received no formal invitation to call on him. At the very least he needed a pretext, and he could think of none.",CO162CL10
493,34,"Some time later, when he was a qualified doctor and living on Rua de Matacavalos, near Rua do Conde, he met Fortunato in a streetcar. He subsequently bumped into him on several more occasions, and the frequency of those encounters led to a certain degree of familiarity. One day, Fortunato invited him to come and visit him nearby, in Catumbi.",CO162CL10
494,35,“You do know that I’m married?”,CO162CL10
495,36,"“No, I didn’t.”",CO162CL10
496,37,"“I got married four months ago, although it seems like four days. Come and dine with us on Sunday.”",CO162CL10
497,38,“Sunday?”,CO162CL10
498,39,"“Now, don’t start making excuses. I won’t hear of it. Come on Sunday.”",CO162CL10
499,40,"Garcia duly went on Sunday. Fortunato gave him a good dinner, good cigars, and good conversation, in the company of his wife, who was an interesting woman. Fortunato’s face had not changed; his eyes were the same sheets of cold, hard tin, and his other features were no more attractive, either.",CO162CL10
500,41,"While his obliging manners did not entirely make up for his gruff nature, they were at least some compensation. Maria Luísa, on the other hand, was charming both in person and in manners.",CO162CL10
501,42,"She was slim and elegant, with soft, submissive eyes; she was twenty-five years old, but looked not a day over nineteen.",CO162CL10
502,43,"On his second visit, Garcia noticed that there was between the couple a certain disparity of character, little or no emotional affinity, and the wife’s attitude toward her husband went beyond respect, bordering almost on subjection and fear.",CO162CL10
503,44,"One day, when the three of them were together, Garcia asked Maria Luísa if she had heard about the circumstances in which he had met her husband.",CO162CL10
504,45,"“No,” replied the young lady.",CO162CL10
505,46,“Then you’re going to hear the tale of a very handsome deed.”,CO162CL10
506,47,"“There’s really no need,” said Fortunato, interrupting.",CO162CL10
507,48,"“I shall let you be the judge of that, senhora,” Garcia insisted.",CO162CL10
508,49,"He described the events on Rua Dom Manuel. The young lady listened in astonishment, unconsciously reaching out her hand to grasp her husband’s wrist, smiling in gratitude, as if she had just discovered that he did actually have a heart. Fortunato shrugged, but was clearly not unmoved.",CO162CL10
509,50,"Afterward, he himself described the wounded man’s visit, describing the look on his face, his gestures, his garbled words and awkward silences—a complete idiot, in fact.",CO162CL10
510,51,He laughed and laughed as he spoke. There was no guile in that laughter; guile is evasive and oblique; his laughter was jovial and frank.,CO162CL10
511,52,“What a peculiar man!” thought Garcia.,CO162CL10
512,53,"Maria Luísa was saddened by her husband’s mocking account, but Garcia restored her previous contentment by returning to the subject of Fortunato’s dedication and rare qualities as a nurse: “So good a nurse,” he concluded, “that if someday I were to set up my own private hospital, I would invite him to join me.”",CO162CL10
513,54,“Are you serious?” asked Fortunato.,CO162CL10
514,55,“About what?”,CO162CL10
515,56,“About setting up a hospital together?”,CO162CL10
516,57,"“No, not at all; I was joking.”",CO162CL10
517,58,"“Well, we could give it a go, and for you, just starting out, it might not be a bad idea. I own a house that is about to become vacant, and that would be just the ticket.”",CO162CL10
518,59,"Garcia refused then, and refused again the following day, but the idea had lodged itself in the other man’s head and there was no going back. It would indeed make a good start to Garcia’s career, and it could well become a profitable venture for them both. He finally accepted a few days later, much to Maria Luísa’s disappointment.",CO162CL10
519,60,"A nervous, fragile creature, she shuddered at the mere thought of her husband living in contact with human diseases, but she didn’t dare oppose him, and so bowed her head. Plans were quickly laid and carried out.",CO162CL10
520,61,"In fact, Fortunato paid little attention to anything else, either then or later. When the hospital opened, he himself became the administrator and chief nurse: he inspected everything and organized everything, from soups to storerooms, medicines to ledgers.",CO162CL10
521,62,"Garcia could see then that the dedication he had shown toward the wounded man on Rua Dom Manuel had not been an isolated event, but was grounded in the man’s very nature.",CO162CL10
522,63,"He watched him serve more willingly than any of the servants. He did not recoil from anything; no disease distressed or repelled him and he was always ready for anything, at any hour of the day or night. Everyone admired and applauded him. Fortunato read books, attended all the surgical operations, and it was he alone who applied the caustic lotions.",CO162CL10
523,64,"“I have a lot of faith in caustic lotions,” he used to say",CO162CL10
524,65,"Their common interests strengthened their bonds of friendship. Garcia was a frequent visitor to the house; he dined there almost every day, observing Maria Luísa and her ever more apparent emotional isolation, an isolation that merely doubled her charms, he thought.",CO162CL10
525,66,"Garcia began to feel a certain agitation whenever she appeared, when she talked, when she would sit silently sewing by the window, or play sad songs on the piano. Softly, gently, love slipped into his heart.",CO162CL10
526,67,"When he realized this, he tried to drive it out, so that there would be no bond but his friendship with Fortunato, but he could not. He could only lock it away; Maria Luísa understood both his affection and his silence, but said nothing.",CO162CL10
527,68,"At the beginning of October, something happened that revealed to Garcia yet more of the young lady’s plight. Fortunato had taken up the study of anatomy and physiology, and spent his free time dissecting and poisoning cats and dogs.",CO162CL10
528,69,"Since the animals’ squeals disturbed the patients, he moved his laboratory to the house, forcing his wife, with her nervous temperament, to endure their cries.",CO162CL10
529,70,"One day, however, unable to bear it any longer, she went to see Garcia and begged him to ask her husband, on her behalf, to put an end to these experiments.",CO162CL10
530,71,“But couldn’t you yourself . . .”,CO162CL10
531,72,"Maria Luísa answered with a smile: “He would no doubt think it very childish of me. What I would like is for you, as a doctor, to tell him that it’s doing me harm; for, believe me, it most certainly is.”",CO162CL10
532,73,"Garcia promptly persuaded Fortunato to end his live experiments. No one knew if he continued them elsewhere, but he may well have done. Maria Luísa thanked Garcia, for her own sake and that of the animals, for she could not bear to see them suffer. She coughed from time to time; Garcia asked if anything was the matter; she said there wasn’t.",CO162CL10
533,74,“Let me feel your pulse.”,CO162CL10
534,75,“There’s nothing wrong with me.”,CO162CL10
535,76,"She wouldn’t let him feel her pulse, and left the room. Garcia became apprehensive. He thought there might indeed be something wrong with her, and that he would need to keep a close eye on her and warn her husband in good time.",CO162CL10
536,77,"Two days later—the very day on which we see them now—Garcia went to dinner with them. When he arrived, he was told that Fortunato was in his study and so he immediately made his way there. He had just reached the door when Maria Luísa rushed out in a state of terrible distress.",CO162CL10
537,78,“What’s the matter?” he asked.,CO162CL10
538,79,"“The mouse! The mouse!” exclaimed the young lady, gasping for air and rushing away.",CO162CL10
539,80,"Garcia remembered that the evening before he had heard Fortunato complaining that a mouse had chewed up an important document. He did not, however, expect to see what now appeared before him. Fortunato was sitting at the table in the middle of the study, and on the table sat a dish of alcohol. The liquid was alight.",CO162CL10
540,81,"Between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand he held a piece of string, from which the mouse dangled by its tail. In his right hand was a pair of scissors. At the precise moment Garcia entered the room, Fortunato snipped off one of the mouse’s legs; then he slowly lowered the poor creature into the flame, only briefly, so as not to kill it, and then prepared to snip the third leg, for he had already cut off the first before Garcia arrived. Garcia froze in horror.",CO162CL10
541,82,“Kill it now!” he said.,CO162CL10
542,83,“Just a moment.”,CO162CL10
543,84,"And with a most peculiar smile, something that hinted at an inner satisfaction, the slow savoring of sublime sensations, Fortunato cut off the mouse’s third leg, and for the third time lowered the mouse into the flame. The miserable creature writhed and squealed in agony, bloodied and scorched, but still did not die.",CO162CL10
544,85,"Garcia turned away, then looked back and reached out his hand to stop the torture. But he did nothing, because this devil of a man, his face radiant and serene, filled him with fear.",CO162CL10
545,86,"Only the last leg remained; Fortunato cut it very slowly, his eyes fixed on the scissors; the leg fell, and he continued to stare at the half-dead mouse. When he lowered it into the flame for the fourth time, he did so even more briefly than before, so as to salvage, if he could, whatever shred of life remained.",CO162CL10
546,87,"Standing in front of him, Garcia managed to overcome his repugnance at the spectacle and stared into the man’s face. There was neither anger nor hatred there, simply an immense pleasure, quiet and profound, such as another man might get from hearing a beautiful sonata or gazing at an exquisite statue—something resembling a purely aesthetic sensation.",CO162CL10
547,88,"It seemed to him, and indeed it was the case, that Fortunato had forgotten all about him. He could not, therefore, be pretending, and Garcia’s analysis must be correct. The flame was dying down, and the mouse retained perhaps the faintest glimmer of life; Fortunato put this possibility to good use by cutting off the mouse’s nose and, for the last time, lowering the exposed flesh into the flame.",CO162CL10
548,89,"Finally, he let the dead body fall into the dish, and pushed the mess of charred flesh and blood away from him.",CO162CL10
549,90,"When he stood up, he saw Garcia and jumped. Then he put on a display of rage against the animal for having devoured his precious document, but his anger was clearly a sham.",CO162CL10
550,91,"“He punishes coldly and without anger,” thought Garcia, “driven by the need for a pleasure that only another’s pain can give him: that is his secret.”",CO162CL10
551,92,"Fortunato stressed the importance of the lost document and the time he had wasted because of it; true, it was only time, but time was now so precious to him. Garcia listened without saying anything, without believing him.",CO162CL10
552,93,"He recalled other things he had seen Fortunato do, both the serious and the trivial, and he found the same explanation for all of them. It was the same key change in all of that man’s sensibilities, a peculiar form of dilettantism, a miniature Caligula.",CO162CL10
553,94,"When, shortly afterward, Maria Luísa returned to the study, her husband went up to her, chuckling, took her hands, and whispered gently:",CO162CL10
554,95,“You big softy!”,CO162CL10
555,96,"And, turning to Garcia, he said:",CO162CL10
556,97,“Would you believe she nearly fainted?”,CO162CL10
557,98,"Maria Luísa timidly defended herself, saying she was nervous, and a woman; then she went to sit by the window with her needles and threads, her fingers still trembling, just as we saw her at the beginning of this story. You will remember that, after talking of other matters, the three of them fell silent, the husband sitting, gazing up at the ceiling, the doctor picking at his fingernails.",CO162CL10
558,99,"A little later, they sat down to dinner, but it was not a happy occasion. Maria Luísa brooded and coughed; Garcia wondered if the company of such a man might not, perhaps, expose her to some violent excess. It was only a possibility, but his love transformed possibility into certainty; he trembled for her and resolved to keep a close eye on both of them.",CO162CL10
559,100,"She coughed and coughed, and it wasn’t long before the illness removed its mask. It was consumption, that insatiable old hag that sucks life to the core, leaving only a husk of bare bones. It came as a tremendous blow to Fortunato; he truly loved his wife, in his fashion; he was used to her and it would be hard to lose her. He spared no effort, doctors, medication, changes of air, resorted to every possible remedy and palliative. But all in vain. The illness was fatal.",CO162CL10
560,101,"During the final days, as Garcia watched the young lady’s terrible suffering, her husband’s inner nature prevailed over any other sentiments he may have had. He never left her side and watched with a cold, dull eye as her life slowly, painfully decayed, drinking in one by one the afflictions of that beautiful creature, now thin and transparent, devoured by fever and consumed by death.",CO162CL10
561,102,"His raging egotism, hungry for sensation, would not let him miss one single moment of her agony, nor repay her with a single tear, public or private. Only when she died did the shock hit him. When he came to his senses again, he saw that once again he was alone.",CO162CL10
562,103,"That night, when a relative of Maria Luísa’s, who had helped her while she was dying, left the room in order to rest, Fortunato and Garcia stayed, watching over the corpse, both of them deep in thought. But the husband was himself exhausted and Garcia told him to rest a little.",CO162CL10
563,104,"“Go and sleep for an hour or two; afterward, it will be my turn.”",CO162CL10
564,105,"Fortunato went and lay down on the sofa in the adjoining room, and promptly fell asleep. Twenty minutes later he woke, tried to go back to sleep, dozed for a few moments, then got up and returned to the drawing room. He walked on tiptoe so as not to wake the relative, who was sleeping nearby. As he reached the door, he stopped in astonishment.",CO162CL10
565,106,"Garcia had gone over to the body, lifted the veil, and gazed for several moments at the dead woman’s features. Then, as if death rendered all things spiritual, he leaned over and kissed her forehead. It was then that Fortunato reached the door.",CO162CL10
566,107,"He stopped in his tracks; it could not be a kiss of friendship, but perhaps rather the epilogue to an adulterous novel. Note that he felt no jealousy; nature had formed him in such a way as to give him neither jealousy nor envy, but it had given him vanity, which is no less prone to resentment. He watched in astonishment, biting his lip.",CO162CL10
567,108,"Meanwhile, Garcia leaned over to kiss the corpse again, but this time he could no longer contain himself. That kiss became a sob, and his eyes could not hold back the tears that streamed down his face, tears of silent love and unquenchable despair. Still standing at the door, Fortunato quietly savored this outburst of spiritual pain, which went on, and on, for a deliciously long time.",CO162CL10

583,16,"Duarte remembered that the major had indeed spoken on a previous occasion of several inaugural addresses, two or three eulogies, and a fair number of articles he had written about the River Plate campaigns.",CO060CL10
584,17,"For many years, however, Lopo Alves had let the Platine generals and the dead rest in peace, and there had been nothing to suggest that the illness would return, still less in the form of a drama. Our young graduate would have had a better understanding of the situation if he had known that, a few weeks earlier, Lopo Alves had attended the performance of a drama of the ultra-romantic variety, which had greatly pleased him and had planted the idea in his head of braving the footlights himself.",CO060CL10
585,18,"However, the major failed to vouchsafe these necessary details, and the graduate remained unaware of the reason behind this explosion of dramatic energy. Indeed, he neither knew nor wished to remedy his ignorance. Instead, he extolled the major’s intellectual abilities, expressed his fervent wish to attend what would surely be a triumphant opening night, promised to recommend it to some friends of his who wrote for the Correio Mercantil, and only paused for breath, and promptly turned pale, when he saw the major, trembling with pleasure, unroll the bundle of papers he had brought with him.",CO060CL10
586,19,"“I’m very grateful for your good intentions,” said Lopo Alves, “and I gladly accept your promise of support, but, first, I have another favor to ask of you. I know you’re an intelligent, well-read man, and you must tell me frankly what you think of my work. I’m not asking for compliments; what I want from you is honesty, and brutal honesty, at that. If you think it’s no good, you must say so without mincing your words.”",CO060CL10
587,20,"Duarte would have liked to let that bitter cup pass, but it was difficult to ask and impossible to refuse. Dejectedly, he consulted his watch, which now showed five minutes to ten, while the major leafed paternally through the one hundred and eighty pages of the manuscript.",CO060CL10
588,21,"“It will be very quick,” said Lopo Alves. “I know what you young men are like, especially when it comes to dances. Don’t worry—you’ll still be able to dance two or three waltzes with your young lady, if you have one, or with all of them, if you don’t. Wouldn’t it be better if we went into your study?”",CO060CL10
589,22,"For the hapless young man, the place of torture was immaterial; he submitted to his guest’s wishes. The latter, with the liberty to which his position entitled him, told the houseboy not to let anyone disturb them. The torturer did not want any witnesses. The study door closed, and Lopo Alves took up his position by the desk, facing the young man, who sank both his body and his despair into a vast leather armchair, determined to say not a word so that the end would come sooner.",CO060CL10
590,23,"The drama was divided into seven scenes. This information alone made the reluctant listener shudder. The only novelty in those hundred and eighty pages would be the author’s own handwriting. The rest would be the situations, characters, plot devices, and even the style of the most hackneyed of tousle-headed romanticism.",CO060CL10
591,24,"Lopo Alves thought he had created a work of originality, when he had done nothing more than cobble together his own reminiscences. At any other moment, this might have amounted to an amusing entertainment. Early on in the first scene—a sort of prologue—there was an abducted child, a poisoning, two masked men, the point of a dagger, and a host of equally dagger-sharp adjectives.",CO060CL10
592,25,"In the second scene, there occurred the death of one of the masked men, who would come back to life in the third, only to be taken prisoner in the fifth, and kill the tyrant in the seventh. As well as the apparent death of the masked man, the second scene included the kidnapping of the child, by then a young lady of seventeen years, a monologue that seemed to last at least the same amount of time, and the theft of a will.",CO060CL10
593,26,"It was almost eleven o’clock when he finished reading the second scene. Duarte could barely contain his anger; by now it was far too late to go to Rio Comprido. It would not be idle conjecture to imagine that if, at that moment, the major had breathed his last, Duarte would have given thanks for his death as a gift of Divine Providence.",CO060CL10
594,27,"The young man’s fine sentiments would not lead one to suspect such ferocious feelings, but reading a bad book is capable of producing the most astonishing effects. In addition to which, while our young graduate’s eyes gazed blankly at Lopo Alves’s thick and shaggy mane, in his mind’s eye there burned the golden threads that adorned the fair, sweet head of Cecília; he could see her blue eyes, the pale bloom of her complexion, and her delicate, graceful gestures, surpassing all the other ladies in Widow Meneses’s drawing room.",CO060CL10
595,28,"Not only could he see it, he could hear in his head the music, the conversation, the sound of footsteps, and the rustle of silk, while Lopo Alves’s voice droned hoarsely on through scene after scene, dialogue after dialogue, with all the impassiveness of devout conviction.",CO060CL10
596,29,"Time was marching on, and the listener had, by now, lost count of the scenes. Midnight had struck long ago; he had missed the dance entirely. All of a sudden, the major rolled up his manuscript, stood up straight, fixed him with an evil, hate-filled gaze, and rushed hastily from the room. Duarte wanted to call after him, but surprise had numbed both voice and limbs. When he regained control of his senses, he could hear the irritable, metallic click of the dramaturge’s heels on the cobbled sidewalk outside.",CO060CL10
597,30,He went to the window; he could neither see nor hear anything. Both author and drama had vanished.,CO060CL10
598,31,“Why couldn’t he have done that earlier?” the graduate asked himself with a sigh.,CO060CL10
599,32,"The sigh barely had time to spread its wings and fly out the window in search of Rio Comprido, when the houseboy came to tell him that there was a short, fat man at the front door.",CO060CL10
600,33,“At this hour!” exclaimed Duarte.,CO060CL10
601,34,"“Yes, at this hour,” replied the short, fat man, entering the drawing room. “When it concerns a serious crime, the police may enter a citizen’s house at this or any hour.”",CO060CL10
602,35,“A crime!”,CO060CL10
603,36,“I believe you know who I am . . .”,CO060CL10
604,37,“I haven’t had that honor.”,CO060CL10
605,38,“I work for the police.”,CO060CL10
606,39,“But what crime are you talking about? What has this to do with me?”,CO060CL10
607,40,"“A minor offense: a theft. You are accused, sir, of having made off with a Turkish slipper. It would seem that the slipper in question is of little or no value, but there are slippers and slippers. It all depends on the circumstances.”",CO060CL10
608,41,"The man said this with a sarcastic laugh, while fixing our young graduate with the eyes of an inquisitor. Duarte was not even aware of the existence of the stolen object. He concluded that it must be a case of mistaken identity and resolved not to rise to the insult being hurled at his person, and to some extent at his class, with this accusation of petty larceny. This is what he said to the police officer, adding that, in any event, this was no justification for disturbing him at such a late hour.",CO060CL10
609,42,"“Do forgive me,” said the representative of the law. “The slipper in question is worth several dozen contos de réis; it’s adorned with the finest of diamonds, making it particularly precious. It is Turkish not only in shape, but also in origin.",CO060CL10
610,43,"Its owner, one of the most well-traveled ladies of our nobility, was in Egypt approximately three years ago, where she purchased it from a Jew. The story told her by this follower of Moses regarding the aforementioned product of Muslim art is truly miraculous, and, to my way of thinking, completely false.",CO060CL10
611,44,"But it is not my place to say so. What matters is that she was robbed, and the police have received a complaint against you, sir.”",CO060CL10
612,45,"By this point in his speech, the man was standing by the window; Duarte suspected him to be a lunatic or a thief. However, he had no time to think further, because a few seconds later five armed men entered the room and proceeded to grab him and push him down the steps, oblivious to his shouts and his desperate attempts to free himself.",CO060CL10
613,46,"Outside in the street was a carriage, which they bundled him into. The short, fat man was already inside, along with a tall, thin individual; they hauled him in and made him sit in the back of the carriage. He heard the crack of the coachman’s whip, and the carriage set off at a tilt.",CO060CL10
614,47,"“Aha!” said the fat man. “So you thought you could get away with stealing Turkish slippers, courting pretty blond ladies, possibly marrying them, and still thumb your nose at the human race?”",CO060CL10
615,48,"Hearing this allusion to the lady of his thoughts, Duarte shuddered. Could this be some sort of revenge by a supplanted rival? Or was the reference merely coincidental? Duarte lost himself in a thicket of conjectures, while the carriage continued to career forward at a full gallop. After a while, he ventured an observation.",CO060CL10
616,49,"“Whatever my crimes may be, I presume that the police—”",CO060CL10
617,50,"“We aren’t the police,” the thin man interrupted coolly.",CO060CL10
618,51,“Ah!”,CO060CL10
619,52,"“This gentlemen and I are a pair. He, you, and I will make a trio. Of course, a trio is no better than a pair, indeed how could it be? The ideal is a couple. You probably don’t understand me, do you?”",CO060CL10
620,53,"“No, I don’t.”",CO060CL10
621,54,“You will soon enough.”,CO060CL10
622,55,"Duarte resigned himself to waiting, sank into silence, and slumped back in his seat, letting both the carriage and the adventure run their course. Some five minutes later, the horses came to a halt.",CO060CL10
623,56,"“Here we are,” said the fat man.",CO060CL10
624,57,"And as he said this, he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to our young hero to use as a blindfold. Duarte refused, but the thin man remarked that it would be more prudent on his part to obey than resist. Duarte did not resist; he himself tied the handkerchief about his head to cover his eyes and stepped out of the carriage.",CO060CL10
625,58,"Then he heard a door creak; two people—probably the same two who had accompanied him in the carriage—held his hands and led him down endless corridors and stairways. On the way, he could hear unfamiliar voices, random words, and snatches of sentences. Finally, they stopped; he was told to sit down and remove the blindfold. Duarte obeyed, but only to find that there was no one there.",CO060CL10
626,59,"He was in a vast room, brightly lit and elegantly and opulently furnished. The decoration was perhaps a little overdone; nevertheless, the person who had chosen it must have had very refined tastes. The bronzes, the lacquerware, the rugs and mirrors—the abundance of objects filling the room—were all of the finest quality. The sight of this restored a certain serenity to the young man’s mind; it seemed unlikely that this could be the home of thieves.",CO060CL10
627,60,"He leaned back languidly on an ottoman . . . An ottoman! This promptly reminded him of how this whole adventure had begun, and about the stolen slipper. A few moments of reflection were enough for him to realize that the slipper in question had become more than problematic. Digging deeper into the world of conjectures, he seemed to stumble upon a new and definitive explanation.",CO060CL10
628,61,"The slipper was simply a metaphor; it represented Cecília’s heart, which he had stolen, a crime for which his supposed rival now wished to punish him. This must, of course, be linked to the thin man’s mysterious words: “a pair is better than a trio; the ideal is a couple.”",CO060CL10
629,62,"“That’s what it must be,” concluded Duarte. “But who, then, is this rejected suitor?”",CO060CL10
630,63,"At that moment, a door at the far end of the room opened and there appeared the black cassock of a pale, bald priest. Duarte sprang to his feet. The priest slowly crossed the room, pausing to bless Duarte as he passed, and left by another door in the wall opposite. Our young graduate stood there motionless, his eyes fixed on the door, staring without seeing, completely dumbstruck.",CO060CL10
631,64,"The priest’s unexpected appearance confounded all his previous theories about the adventure. However, there was no time to think up a new explanation, because the first door once again opened and another figure entered; this time it was the thin man, who came straight over to Duarte and asked him to follow him. Duarte did as he was told.",CO060CL10
632,65,"They went out through a third door, and, making their way along several dimly lit corridors, they came to another room, lit only by the candles in the two silver candlesticks placed on a wide table. At the head of the table sat an old man who looked about fifty-five; he had an athletic body, very thick hair, and a bushy beard.",CO060CL10
633,66,“Do you know who I am?” asked the old man as soon as Duarte entered the room.,CO060CL10
634,67,"“No, I do not, sir.”",CO060CL10
635,68,“No need. What we are about to do requires no introductions. You should first know that the theft of the slipper was a mere pretext—”,CO060CL10
636,69,"“Quite!” said Duarte, interrupting him.",CO060CL10
637,70,"“A mere pretext,” continued the old man, “to bring you to our house. The slipper was not stolen; it never left its owner’s possession. João Rufino, bring the slipper.”",CO060CL10
638,71,"The thin man left the room, and the old man informed our young graduate that the famous slipper was not sewn with diamonds, nor had it been purchased from a Jew in Egypt. It was, however, Turkish, according to what he’d been told, and it was miraculously small. Duarte listened to this explanation and, summoning all his strength, asked resolutely:",CO060CL10
639,72,"“But, sir, will you not tell me, once and for all, what you want from me and why I am here in this house?”",CO060CL10
640,73,"“All in due course,” replied the old man calmly.",CO060CL10
641,74,"The door opened, and the thin man appeared, holding the slipper. Invited to come closer to the light, Duarte was able to ascertain that the slipper was indeed miraculously small. It was made of the finest Moroccan leather and on its padded insole, lined with blue silk, gleamed two gold-embroidered letters.",CO060CL10
642,75,"“A child’s slipper, wouldn’t you say?” said the old man.",CO060CL10
643,76,“I suppose so.”,CO060CL10
644,77,“Then you suppose wrongly; it is a young lady’s slipper.”,CO060CL10
645,78,"“If you say so, but it has nothing to do with me.”",CO060CL10
646,79,"“Excuse me, but it has everything to do with you, because you will marry the owner of this slipper.”",CO060CL10
647,80,“Marry?” exclaimed Duarte.,CO060CL10
648,81,"“Precisely. João Rufino, go and fetch the slipper’s owner.”",CO060CL10
649,82,"The thin man went out, and returned soon afterward. As he appeared, he drew back the door curtain and a woman entered. She walked toward the middle of the room. She was no mere woman, but a sylph, a poet’s vision, a divine creature.",CO060CL10
650,83,"Her hair was blond and her eyes blue, like Cecília’s; rapturous eyes that sought heaven or seemed to live by it. Her hair, untidily pinned back, formed a halo around her head like that of a saint; only a saint, mind, not a martyr, because the smile that played upon her lips was a smile of holy bliss the like of which has rarely been seen on Earth.",CO060CL10
651,84,"Her body was chastely clothed in a white dress of the finest linen, leaving little visible to the eye, but much to the imagination.",CO060CL10
652,85,"A young man such as ours does not lose his elegant manners, even in situations like this. Upon seeing the young lady, Duarte adjusted his dressing gown, straightened his necktie, and bowed ceremoniously, and she responded with such politeness and grace that the adventure began to appear much less terrifying.",CO060CL10
653,86,"“My dear sir, this is the bride in question.”",CO060CL10
654,87,The young lady lowered her eyes; Duarte replied that he had no wish to marry.,CO060CL10
655,88,"“There are three things you will do right now,” the old man continued impassively. “The first is to marry, the second is to write your will, and the third is to swallow a particular drug from the Levant—”",CO060CL10
656,89,“Poison!” cried Duarte.,CO060CL10
657,90,"“It is commonly known as such, but I give it another name: a passport to heaven.”",CO060CL10
658,91,"Duarte turned pale and cold. He tried to speak, but couldn’t; not even a whimper escaped his lips. He would have fallen to the floor, had there not been a chair nearby into which he let himself sink.",CO060CL10
659,92,"“You have a modest fortune,” continued the old man, “of one hundred and fifty contos de réis. This pearl standing before you will be your sole heiress. João Rufino, go and fetch the priest.”",CO060CL10
660,93,"The priest entered, the same priest who had blessed our young graduate a short time earlier. He went straight over to the young man, solemnly mumbling a passage from Nehemiah, or some other minor prophet. He crossed himself and said:",CO060CL10
661,94,“Stand up!”,CO060CL10
662,95,“No! I don’t want to! I will not marry!”,CO060CL10
663,96,"“Is that so?” said the old man from the other side of the table, pointing a pistol at him.",CO060CL10
664,97,"“So it’s murder, is it?”",CO060CL10
665,98,"“It is, but the difference lies in the manner of your death. You can either die violently from a bullet or gently by taking the drug. You choose!”",CO060CL10
666,99,"Duarte was sweating and shaking. He wanted to stand up, but couldn’t. His knees were knocking. The priest came and whispered in his ear:",CO060CL10
667,100,“Do you want to escape?”,CO060CL10
668,101,"“Yes!” he exclaimed, although not with his lips, for then he would have been overheard, but with his eyes, in which he placed every remaining hope of life.",CO060CL10
669,102,“See that window over there? It’s open and beneath it is the garden. Jump out now; it’s quite safe.”,CO060CL10
670,103,"“Oh, Father!” whispered our young man.",CO060CL10
671,104,“I’m not a priest; I’m an army lieutenant. But don’t say a word.”,CO060CL10
672,105,"The window stood slightly ajar; through the crack he could see a sliver of sky, already brightening. Duarte did not hesitate; he summoned all his strength and jumped, throwing himself upon the mercy of God. It wasn’t very high, and the young man didn’t have far to fall; he quickly picked himself up, but the fat man, who was out in the garden, caught up with him.",CO060CL10
673,106,"“What’s all this?” he asked, laughing.",CO060CL10
674,107,"Duarte did not answer; he clenched his fists, beat them violently against the man’s chest, and started running across the lawn. The man didn’t fall despite the heavy blows, and when he’d recovered, he immediately set off in pursuit of the fugitive. Thus began a breakneck chase.",CO060CL10
675,108,"Duarte scaled fences and walls, trampled flower beds, and collided with the trees that, from time to time, rose up in front of him. Sweat poured down his body, his chest heaved, and, little by little, his strength began to ebb away; one of his hands was gashed, his shirt damp with dew from the leaves; twice he was almost captured when his dressing gown got caught on a thorny hedge.",CO060CL10
676,109,"At last, tired, bruised, and out of breath, he stumbled and fell on the stone steps leading up to a house standing in the middle of a garden. He looked back, but saw no one; his pursuer was nowhere to be seen, or at least not yet. Duarte struggled to his feet, climbed the remaining four steps, and crept into the house through a door that stood open and led into a small, low-ceilinged room.",CO060CL10
677,110,"A man was sitting there, reading a copy of the Jornal do Commercio, but he seemed not to have noticed him enter. Duarte collapsed into a chair. He stared at the man. It was Major Lopo Alves.",CO060CL10

She was on the top rung; she was beautiful, rich, elegant and a member of high society.

Quintilia said she would do nothing without consulting her uncle, and the uncle advised refusal – something she knew would happen. The good old fellow never liked men visiting, out of fear his niece would choose one and marry.

I paced around a bit in despair, then sat down again and recounted everything.

He lived, as it were, on divine remnants, on human carelessness and obsequies. Nothing fixed, nothing regular. Why wouldn't he have his church?

All the virtues whose cover of velvet ended up in cotton fringe, once pulled by the fringe, they lay down their cloak on nettles and came to join the new church.

The Devil elevated shouts of triumphs.",CO116CL13
819,53,"One day, however, many years later the Devil noticed that many of his faithful, on the sly, practiced the ancient virtues. They did not practice them all, not entirely, but some, in parts, and, as I say, in secret. Certain gluttons withdrew to eat sparingly three or four times a year, precisely on days of Catholic precept; many miserly gave alms, at night, or in the poorly populated streets; several dilapidators of the purse returned small amounts to him; the fraudsters spoke, once or again, with their hearts in their hands, but with the same sly face, to make us believe that they were fogging up the others.",CO116CL13

822,56,"The Benedictine manuscript cites many other extraordinary discoveries, including this one, which completely disoriented the Devil. One of his best apostles was a Calabrian, fifty-year-old man, a distinguished forger of documents, who owned a beautiful house in the Roman campaign, canvases, statues, a library, etc. He was fraud in person; he even got into bed not to confess that he was healthy.

829,4,"AN OLD BENEDICTINE MANUSCRIPT tells how, one day, the Devil had the idea of founding a church. Although he was making steady and substantial profits, he felt humiliated by the rather isolated role he had played down the centuries, with no organization, no rules, no canon law, and no rituals, indeed nothing much at all. He lived, so to speak, on divine leftovers, on human oversights and favors. Nothing fixed, nothing regular. Why shouldn’t he have his own church? A Devil’s Church would be the best way to take on the other religions and destroy them once and for all.",CO116CL10
830,5,"“Yes, a church of my own,” he concluded. “Scripture against Scripture, breviary against breviary. I’ll have my own mass, with wine and bread aplenty, my own sermons, bulls, novenas, and all the other ecclesiastical bells and whistles. My creed will be the universal nucleus of souls, my church a tent of Abraham. And then, while other religions quarrel and split, my church will stand united and alone, with no Muhammad or Luther to oppose me. There are many ways to affirm a belief, but only one way to deny it.”",CO116CL10
831,6,"As he said this, the Devil shook his head and stretched out his arms in a magnificently manly gesture. Then he remembered that he really ought to go and see God, to tell him his plan and throw down this challenge; he raised his eyes, burning with hatred and bitter with revenge, and said to himself: “Yes, it is time.” And with a beat of his wings—which set off a rumble that shook all the provinces of the abyss—he flew swiftly up from the shadows into the infinite blue.",CO116CL10

860,35,GOOD NEWS FOR MANKIND,CO116CL10
861,36,"Once on Earth, the Devil did not waste a single minute. He hurriedly donned a Benedictine cowl—as being a habit of good repute—and began to spread a new and extraordinary doctrine with a voice that echoed down through the bowels of the century. He promised his faithful disciples all of Earth’s delights, all its glories, and all its most intimate pleasures. He admitted that he was indeed the Devil, but did so in order to rectify mankind’s view of him and to deny the stories pious old women told about him.",CO116CL10
862,37,"“Yes, I am the Devil,” he said again and again. “Not the Devil of sulfurous nights, of bedtime stories, or childish terrors, but the one and only true Devil, the very genius of nature, who was given that name to drive him from the hearts of men. See how gentle and graceful I am. I am your true father. Come with me: embrace the name that was invented to shame me, make it your trophy and your banner, and I will give you everything, absolutely everything . . .”",CO116CL10
863,38,"Thus he spoke in order to arouse enthusiasm and awaken the indifferent, in short, to gather the multitudes around him. And they came; and once they were with him, the Devil began to set out his doctrine. The doctrine was what one would expect from the mouth of a spirit of denial, at least in terms of substance. As for its form, it was at times clever and at others cynical and shameless.",CO116CL10
864,39,"He proclaimed that the accepted virtues should be replaced with others, the natural and legitimate ones. Pride, Lust, and Sloth were restored, as was Greed, which he declared was nothing but the mother of Thrift, the sole difference being that the mother was robust and the daughter a scrawny wretch. The best argument in favor of Wrath was the existence of Homer, for without the fury of Achilles, there would have been no Iliad.",CO116CL10
865,40,"“Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus.” He said the same of Gluttony, which produced the best bits of Rabelais and many fine verses in Diniz’s Hyssope. It was such a superior virtue that no one now remembers Lucullus’s battles, only his banquets; it was Gluttony that made him immortal. But still, setting aside these literary or historical justifications and focusing only on the intrinsic value of such a virtue, who would deny that it feels much better to fill one’s mouth and belly with good food than to get by on meager morsels, or the saliva of fasting?",CO116CL10
866,41,"For his part, the Devil promised to replace the Lord’s vineyard, a merely metaphorical expression, with the Devil’s vineyard in the literal sense, for his followers would never want for the fruit of the finest vines. As for Envy, he preached coolly that it was the greatest virtue of all and the source of infinite prosperity; a precious virtue that would come to supplant all the others, even talent itself.",CO116CL10
867,42,"The crowd chased excitedly after him. With great blasts of eloquence, the Devil instilled in them the new order of things, changing all their notions, making them love the things that were wicked and hate those that were wholesome.",CO116CL10
868,43,"There was nothing more curious, for example, than his definition of fraud. He called it man’s left arm, the right arm being force. His conclusion was simply that many men were left-handed, and that was that. Not that he required everyone to be left-handed, for no one was to be excluded. Some could be left-handed, others right-handed; he’d accept everyone, except those who were neither one thing nor the other. His most profound and rigorous explanation, however, was that of Venality.",CO116CL10
869,44,"One casuist of the time even confessed that his explanation was a monument of logic. Venality, said the Devil, was the exercise of a right superior to all others. If you can sell your house, your ox, your shoe, or your hat—things that legally and juridically belong to you but are not part of you—why shouldn’t you be allowed to sell your opinion, your vote, your word, or your faith, things which are more than mere possessions, because they form part of your own consciousness, that is, your very self? To deny this is to lapse into absurdity and contradiction. For are there not women who sell their hair? Can a man not sell some of his blood for transfusion to another who is anemic?",CO116CL10
870,45,"And why should blood and hair, mere physical parts, enjoy a privilege that is denied to character, man’s moral portion? Having thus set out the principle behind Venality, the Devil lost no time in expounding its practical and financial benefits. He then indicated that, in light of social prejudice, it would be appropriate to disguise the exercise of such a well-founded right; this would, of course, amount to practicing Venality and Hypocrisy at the same time, and would therefore be doubly deserving.",CO116CL10
871,46,"Up and down he went, examining and rectifying everything. Naturally he fought against the forgiveness of sins and other such principles of charitable kindness. He didn’t absolutely prohibit the spreading of calumnies without reward, but urged that it should always be done in return for some sort of payment, whether financial or otherwise. However, in cases where the calumny resulted from nothing more than an uncontrollable explosion of impetuous imagination, he forbade any recompense, since that was equivalent to being paid for merely sweating.",CO116CL10
872,47,"He condemned all forms of respect as potential elements of social and personal politeness—except, of course, where there was some sort of advantage to be drawn from it. But this exception was itself soon eliminated by the realization that the desire for personal gain converted a display of respect into straightforward flattery, and the relevant intention was therefore the latter and not the former. To complete his work, the Devil realized that he needed to sever all bonds of human solidarity—the idea of loving one’s neighbor was a major obstacle to his new institution.",CO116CL10
873,48,"He therefore demonstrated that this rule was a mere invention of parasites and insolvent tradesmen; one should show nothing but indifference toward one’s fellow man, and, in some cases, hatred and contempt. He even demonstrated that the notion of “neighbor” was erroneous, and cited the refined and learned Neapolitan priest Ferdinando Galiani, who wrote to a certain marquise de l’ancien régime: “Neighbor be damned! There’s no such thing as neighbor!”",CO116CL10
874,49,"The only situation in which the Devil permitted loving one’s neighbor was when it concerned loving other men’s wives, because that kind of love has the peculiarity of being nothing more than the individual’s love for himself. And since some disciples may have found that such a metaphysical explanation would escape the understanding of the masses, the Devil resorted to an illustration: one hundred people take shares in a retail bank, but, in reality, none of the shareholders looks after the business, only their own dividends: this is what happens to adulterers.

The church had been founded and its doctrine was being propagated; there was not one region of the globe that did not know of it, not one language into which it had not been translated, and not one race that did not love it. The Devil gave a triumphant cheer.",CO116CL10
878,53,"However, one day, many years later, the Devil noticed that many of his faithful followers were secretly practicing the old virtues again. They didn’t practice all of them, or practice them in their entirety, but they did practice some of them, partially, and, as I say, in secret. Certain gluttons were retreating to eat frugally three or four times a year, on days of Catholic obligation; many misers were giving alms under cover of darkness or on sparsely populated streets; various embezzlers of the public purse were reimbursing small amounts; now and then fraudsters spoke the honest truth, although with their usual sly expression just so that people would think they were still being tricked.",CO116CL10
879,54,"This discovery shocked the Devil. He investigated the evil more closely, and saw that it was spreading rapidly.

The Devil confronted him at the entrance to the mosque and berated him for such outrageous behavior, but the man denied everything, saying he was only going there so as to steal a dragoman’s camel; indeed, he did steal it, in full view of the Devil, but then gave it as a present to a muezzin, who prayed to Allah on the thief’s behalf.",CO116CL10

One of his best apostles was a Calabrian gentleman, fifty years old and an eminent forger of documents, who owned a fine house in the Roman Campagna filled with paintings, statues, a library, etc. He was fraud personified; he would even take to his bed so as not to admit that he was in good health.

917,33,"In vain, the Devil tried to say something more, but God had silenced him, and, upon a divine signal, the seraphim filled Heaven with the harmonious sound of their singing. The Devil suddenly found himself in midair; he furled his wings and, like a bolt of lightning, plunged to Earth.",CO116CL12

920,36,"Once on Earth, the Devil did not waste a single minute. He hurriedly donned a Benedictine cowl—as being a habit of good repute—and began to spread a new and extraordinary doctrine with a voice that echoed down through the bowels of the century. He promised his faithful disciples all of Earth’s delights, all its glories, and all its most intimate pleasures. He admitted that he was indeed the Devil, but did so in order to rectify mankind’s view of him and to deny the stories pious old women told about him.",CO116CL12
921,37,"“Yes, I am the Devil,” he said again and again. “Not the Devil of sulfurous nights, of bedtime stories, or childish terrors, but the one and only true Devil, the very genius of nature, who was given that name to drive him from the hearts of men. See how gentle and graceful I am. I am your true father. Come with me: embrace the name that was invented to shame me, make it your trophy and your banner, and I will give you everything, absolutely everything . . .”",CO116CL12
922,38,"Thus he spoke in order to arouse enthusiasm and awaken the indifferent, in short, to gather the multitudes around him. And they came; and once they were with him, the Devil began to set out his doctrine. The doctrine was what one would expect from the mouth of a spirit of denial, at least in terms of substance. As for its form, it was at times clever and at others cynical and shameless.",CO116CL12
923,39,"He proclaimed that the accepted virtues should be replaced with others, the natural and legitimate ones. Pride, Lust, and Sloth were restored, as was Greed, which he declared was nothing but the mother of Thrift, the sole difference being that the mother was robust and the daughter a scrawny wretch. The best argument in favor of Wrath was the existence of Homer, for without the fury of Achilles, there would have been no Iliad.",CO116CL12
924,40,"“Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus.” He said the same of Gluttony, which produced the best bits of Rabelais and many fine verses in Diniz’s Hyssope. It was such a superior virtue that no one now remembers Lucullus’s battles, only his banquets; it was Gluttony that made him immortal. But still, setting aside these literary or historical justifications and focusing only on the intrinsic value of such a virtue, who would deny that it feels much better to fill one’s mouth and belly with good food than to get by on meager morsels, or the saliva of fasting?",CO116CL12
925,41,"For his part, the Devil promised to replace the Lord’s vineyard, a merely metaphorical expression, with the Devil’s vineyard in the literal sense, for his followers would never want for the fruit of the finest vines. As for Envy, he preached coolly that it was the greatest virtue of all and the source of infinite prosperity; a precious virtue that would come to supplant all the others, even talent itself.",CO116CL12
926,42,"The crowd chased excitedly after him. With great blasts of eloquence, the Devil instilled in them the new order of things, changing all their notions, making them love the things that were wicked and hate those that were wholesome.",CO116CL12
927,43,"There was nothing more curious, for example, than his definition of fraud. He called it man’s left arm, the right arm being force. His conclusion was simply that many men were left-handed, and that was that. Not that he required everyone to be left-handed, for no one was to be excluded. Some could be left-handed, others right-handed; he’d accept everyone, except those who were neither one thing nor the other. His most profound and rigorous explanation, however, was that of Venality.",CO116CL12
928,44,"One casuist of the time even confessed that his explanation was a monument of logic. Venality, said the Devil, was the exercise of a right superior to all others. If you can sell your house, your ox, your shoe, or your hat—things that legally and juridically belong to you but are not part of you—why shouldn’t you be allowed to sell your opinion, your vote, your word, or your faith, things which are more than mere possessions, because they form part of your own consciousness, that is, your very self? To deny this is to lapse into absurdity and contradiction. For are there not women who sell their hair? Can a man not sell some of his blood for transfusion to another who is anemic?",CO116CL12
929,45,"And why should blood and hair, mere physical parts, enjoy a privilege that is denied to character, man’s moral portion? Having thus set out the principle behind Venality, the Devil lost no time in expounding its practical and financial benefits. He then indicated that, in light of social prejudice, it would be appropriate to disguise the exercise of such a well-founded right; this would, of course, amount to practicing Venality and Hypocrisy at the same time, and would therefore be doubly deserving.",CO116CL12
930,46,"Up and down he went, examining and rectifying everything. Naturally he fought against the forgiveness of sins and other such principles of charitable kindness. He didn’t absolutely prohibit the spreading of calumnies without reward, but urged that it should always be done in return for some sort of payment, whether financial or otherwise. However, in cases where the calumny resulted from nothing more than an uncontrollable explosion of impetuous imagination, he forbade any recompense, since that was equivalent to being paid for merely sweating.",CO116CL12
931,47,"He condemned all forms of respect as potential elements of social and personal politeness—except, of course, where there was some sort of advantage to be drawn from it. But this exception was itself soon eliminated by the realization that the desire for personal gain converted a display of respect into straightforward flattery, and the relevant intention was therefore the latter and not the former. To complete his work, the Devil realized that he needed to sever all bonds of human solidarity—the idea of loving one’s neighbor was a major obstacle to his new institution.",CO116CL12
932,48,"He therefore demonstrated that this rule was a mere invention of parasites and insolvent tradesmen; one should show nothing but indifference toward one’s fellow man, and, in some cases, hatred and contempt. He even demonstrated that the notion of “neighbor” was erroneous, and cited the refined and learned Neapolitan priest Ferdinando Galiani, who wrote to a certain marquise de l’ancien régime: “Neighbor be damned! There’s no such thing as neighbor!”",CO116CL12
933,49,"The only situation in which the Devil permitted loving one’s neighbor was when it concerned loving other men’s wives, because that kind of love has the peculiarity of being nothing more than the individual’s love for himself. And since some disciples may have found that such a metaphysical explanation would escape the understanding of the masses, the Devil resorted to an illustration: one hundred people take shares in a retail bank, but, in reality, none of the shareholders looks after the business, only their own dividends: this is what happens to adulterers. This illustration was included in the book of wisdom.",CO116CL12

936,52,"The Devil’s prediction came true. As soon as someone tugged the fringe of those virtues whose velvet cloak was fringed with cotton, they duly threw their cloaks into the nettles and joined the new church. The others duly followed and the institution grew over time. The church had been founded and its doctrine was being propagated; there was not one region of the globe that did not know of it, not one language into which it had not been translated, and not one race that did not love it. The Devil gave a triumphant cheer.",CO116CL12
937,53,"However, one day, many years later, the Devil noticed that many of his faithful followers were secretly practicing the old virtues again. They didn’t practice all of them, or practice them in their entirety, but they did practice some of them, partially, and, as I say, in secret. Certain gluttons were retreating to eat frugally three or four times a year, on days of Catholic obligation; many misers were giving alms under cover of darkness or on sparsely populated streets; various embezzlers of the public purse were reimbursing small amounts; now and then fraudsters spoke the honest truth, although with their usual sly expression just so that people would think they were still being tricked.",CO116CL12
938,54,"This discovery shocked the Devil. He investigated the evil more closely, and saw that it was spreading rapidly. Some cases were simply incomprehensible, like that of a Levantine apothecary who had slowly poisoned a whole generation and then, with the profits of his nefarious trade, had come to the aid of his victims’ children.",CO116CL12
939,55,"In Cairo, the Devil found an otherwise impeccable camel thief covering his face so that he could attend the mosque. The Devil confronted him at the entrance to the mosque and berated him for such outrageous behavior, but the man denied everything, saying he was only going there so as to steal a dragoman’s camel; indeed, he did steal it, in full view of the Devil, but then gave it as a present to a muezzin, who prayed to Allah on the thief’s behalf.",CO116CL12
940,56,"The Benedictine manuscript cites many other extraordinary discoveries, including the following one that completely confounded the Devil. One of his best apostles was a Calabrian gentleman, fifty years old and an eminent forger of documents, who owned a fine house in the Roman Campagna filled with paintings, statues, a library, etc. He was fraud personified; he would even take to his bed so as not to admit that he was in good health. However, this man not only failed to cheat at cards, he even gave bonuses to his servants.",CO116CL12
941,57,"Having attracted the friendship of a canon, he went to make his confession to him every week in a deserted side chapel, and although he did not reveal to him any of his secret activities, he crossed himself twice, once upon kneeling and again when he stood up. The Devil could scarcely believe such treachery, but there was no doubting what had happened.",CO116CL12
942,58,"He did not stop for an instant. The shock gave him no time to reflect, to draw comparisons, or to infer from the present situation something analogous in the past. Once again he flew straight up to Heaven, trembling with rage, anxious to discover the hidden cause of such a peculiar occurrence. God listened to him with infinite benevolence, not interrupting or criticizing him, or even gloating over his satanic agony. He looked the Devil straight in the eye and said:",CO116CL12

970,27,"Estêvão, who had already noticed the deputy’s solicitous manners, was completely astonished when he heard him talking about the novel of the friendship. The reason was a simple one.

973,30,The young doctor replied to the deputy’s language with a similar sincerity.,CO023CL09
974,31,“Why will we end in the first chapter?” he asked. “A friend isn’t something one despises; it’s something one welcomes as a gift from the gods.”,CO023CL09

995,52,"Entering home, Estêvão said to himself:",CO023CL09
996,53,"“Where’s that man’s misanthropy? A misanthrope’s manners are rougher than his; except if he, happier than Diógenes, found in me the man he was looking for.”",CO023CL09
997,54,II,CO023CL09
998,55,"Estêvão was the serious young man type. He had talent, ambition and willingness to learn new things, three powerful weapons in the hands of a self-aware man. Since he was sixteen years old his life had been a constant, deep and enduring study. Destined for the medical course, Estêvão was a little forced to join academia; he hadn’t wanted to disobey his father. His vocation was entirely to mathematics. “What’s the matter?” he said when he learnt of his father’s resolution; “I’ll study both Medicine and mathematics.” Effectively, he had time for one thing and the other; he still had time to study literature, and the main ancient and contemporary works were both as familiar to him as the treatises on surgery and hygiene.",CO023CL09
999,56,"In order to study so hard, he needed to sacrifice part of his health. At the age of twenty-four Estêvão was quite slender, and that wasn’t the same as when he was sixteen; he had a pale skin and his head tipped slightly forward due to his longtime reading habit. But these remnants of an extended intellectual application didn’t change the harmony and the regularity of his facial features, and the eyes didn’t lose their shine and expression to the books.",CO023CL09
1000,57,"Besides, he was naturally elegant; I don’t say embellished, which is different; he was elegant in his manners, in his attitudes, in his smile, in his outfit, all of this blended with a certain severity that was the hallmark of his personality. It was possible to notice his many infringements to the fashion code; nobody could say that Estêvão broke the good rules of the gentleman.",CO023CL09
1001,58,"He lost his parents when he was twenty years-old, but he still had much common sense to continue his journey in the world alone. His study habits served him both as a refuge and a protection. He knew nothing about love. He was so busy with his own mind that he forgot he had a heart inside his chest. Let’s not infer from this that Estêvão was purely a positivist.",CO023CL09
1002,59,"On the contrary, his soul still possessed the two wings given by nature in all the fullness of grace and force. Not rarely his soul ruptured the prison of the flesh to run through the spaces in the sky in search of an indefinite, uncertain and obscure ideal. When he came back from these trances, Estêvão cured them by burying himself in books, searching for a scientific truth. Newton was the antidote of Goethe.",CO023CL09
1003,60,"Moreover, Estêvão had singular ideas. There was a priest, a friend of his, a thirty-year old man, from Fénelon’s school, Fenelon who came in with Telemachus on Calypso’s island. Well, the priest said many times to Estêvão that only one thing was missing for his complete happiness: getting married.",CO023CL09
1004,61,"“When you have,” he said, “a loved and loving woman at your feet, then you’ll be a happy and complete man. You’ll share your time between the two most elevated things that nature gave men—intelligence and heart. I want to marry both of you on this day…”",CO023CL09
1005,62,"“Father Luís,” Estêvão replied, “do me the complete service then: bring me the woman and the blessing.”",CO023CL09
1006,63,"The priest smiled when he heard the doctor’s reply, and as his smile seemed to be a new question to Estêvão, the doctor continued:",CO023CL09
1007,64,"“If you find a woman as complete as I demand, I can say that I’ll get married. You’ll say that human works are imperfect, and I won’t contest you, Father Luís; but in this case I ask you to let me walk alone with my imperfections.”",CO023CL09
1008,65,"At this point a discussion was usually engendered, a discussion that livened up and became longer until the point that Estêvão concluded this way:",CO023CL09
1009,66,"“Father Luís, a girl who abandons the dolls to mechanically learn badly chosen books by heart; who interrupts a lesson to hear a story about a romance; who, in the matter of art, only knows the Parisian fashion; who abandons her pants to enter a ball and who, before sighing for a man, examines a tie’s straightness and a boot’s tightness; Father Luís, this girl may come to be a splendid saloon ornament and even a fruitful family mother, but she’ll never be a woman.”",CO023CL09
1010,67,Estêvão’s sentence had the same flaw of certain absolute rules. This is the reason why the priest always said:,CO023CL09
1011,68,"“You’re right; but I’m not telling you to marry the rule; look for the exception that you may find and take her to the altar, the place where I’ll be to marry you both.”",CO023CL09
1012,69,"These were Estêvão’s feelings in relation to love and women. Nature had given him part of them, but they were partly acquired in the books. He demanded the moral and intellectual perfection of Hélöise;10 and he used the exception to establish a rule. He was intolerant in relation to venial mistakes. He didn’t recognize them as such. There aren’t venial mistakes, he said, in terms of habits and love.",CO023CL09
1013,70,"The spectacle of Estêvão own family contributed to his rigidity of spirit. Until his twenties, he witnessed the sanctity of love maintained by domestic virtue. His mother, who had died at thirty-eight, loved her husband until his death, and survived him by a few months.",CO023CL09
1014,71,"Estêvão knew that the love between his parents was ardent and enthusiastic, in the engagement season, during the marital morning; he knew it this way as a tradition; but in the marital afternoon that he watched he saw a calm, confident and solicitous love, full of dedication and respect, practiced as worship, without recriminations or grief, and as deep as it was in the first day. Estêvão’s parents died loved and happy in the peaceful serenity of their duty.",CO023CL09
1015,72,"In Estêvão’s spirit, the love that founds family should be like that or would be nothing. That was fair; but Estêvão’s intolerance began with the idea that the conviction he had was the same held by his family when they died, and that the ultimate tradition of love was also sustained by it. What was necessary to shake this whole system, even though it was momentary? A very small thing: two eyes and a smile.",CO023CL09
1016,73,"But as these eyes didn’t appear, Estêvão devoted the greatest part of his time to his scientific studies, using his free time in distractions that didn’t really hold his attention for long.",CO023CL09
1017,74,"He lived alone; he had one slave, his same age, and who had grown up in his father’s house – more like a brother than a slave, in dedication and affection.

1043,100,"During this dialogue, Estêvão contemplated and observed Menezes, whose face was illuminated by the sunlight which penetrated through a window. He had a severe head, full of gray hair, which fell in a gracious disarray. His eyes were black and slightly droopy; one could guess, however, that they should have been lively and fiery. The whiskers, also gray, were similar to Lord Palmerston’s, according to the pictures. He didn’t have the wrinkles brought by old-age; he had a wrinkle in his forehead, between the eyebrows, an indication of concentration of the spirit, not a sign of time.",CO023CL09
1044,101,"The forehead was high, the chin and the cheekbones a little prominent. It was possible to guess that he had been handsome in the time of his first youth; and it was possible to anticipate an imposing and august old-age for him. He smiled every once in a while; and even though his face wasn’t that of an old man, his smile produced a singular impression; it seemed to be a moonbeam in the middle of an old ruin. The fact is that the smile was amiable, but not happy.",CO023CL09
1045,102,"The whole set of characteristics was impressive and attractive; Estêvão felt increasingly drawn to that man, who sought him out and reached out his hand to him as well.",CO023CL09
1046,103,"The conversation continued in the affectionate tone in which it began; the first interview of friendship is different from the first interview of love; in this one, muteness is a great eloquence; in that one, confidence is inspired and won by the sincere exposition of feelings and ideas.",CO023CL09
1047,104,"They didn’t talk about politics. Estêvão alluded in passing to Menezes’s functions, but it was a real incident to which the deputy paid no attention.",CO023CL09
1048,105,"By the end of one hour, Estêvão stood up to leave; he had to see a patient.",CO023CL09
1049,106,"“The reason is sacred; otherwise, I’d hold you.”",CO023CL09
1050,107,“But I’ll be back other times.”,CO023CL09
1051,108,"“No doubt, and I’ll also go and see you again. If by the end of fifteen days you’re not annoyed… Look, come in the afternoon; have dinner with me sometimes; after the Chamber I’m completely free.”",CO023CL09
1052,109,"Estêvão left, promising everything.",CO023CL09
1053,110,"He returned indeed, and twice had dinner with the deputy, who also visited Estêvão in his house. They went to the theater together; they established intimate relationships with the families they knew. By the end of one month they were two old friends. They had both observed each other’s characters and feelings. Menezes appreciated the doctor’s seriousness and common sense; he liked him even with his intolerances, praising the generous ambition which dominated him.",CO023CL09
1054,111,"From his side the doctor saw Menezes as a man who knew how to associate the austerity of his age with the kindness of a gentleman, being modest in his manners, well-read and sentimental. He found no traces of said misantropy. It’s true that, on some occasions, Menezes seemed to be more willing to listen than to speak; and then his look became gloomy and lifeless, as if he were contemplating his own consciousness instead of seeing exterior objects. But these moments were quick, and Menezes soon returned to his usual behavior.",CO023CL09
1055,112,"“He’s not a misanthrope,” Estêvão thought, “but he has some tragedy inside himself.”",CO023CL09
1056,113,"Estêvão’s observation acquired a certain air of verisimilitude one night when they were both at Theatro Lyrico, and Estêvão called Menezes’s attention to a woman in black, who was in a first-class box.",CO023CL09
1057,114,"“I don’t know that woman,” Estêvão said. “Do you know who she is?”",CO023CL09
1058,115,"Menezes looked at the indicated box, contemplated the woman for a moment and replied:",CO023CL09
1059,116,"“No, I don’t.”",CO023CL09
1060,117,"The conversation ended at this point; but the doctor noticed that the woman looked twice at Menezes, and he looked twice at her, their eyes meeting each other’s.",CO023CL09
1061,118,"At the end of the show, the two friends went down the hallway to the side where the woman in black was. Estêvão just had a new curiosity, the artist’s curiosity: he wanted to see her closely. But the box’s door was closed. Would she have already left or not? It was impossible to know. Menezes passed by the box without looking at it. When they arrived at the top of the stairs facing one of the sides of Rua dos Ciganos, they both stopped because there was a great number of people. After a while hasty steps were heard; Menezes turned his face to the other side, and giving his arm to Estêvão, went down the stairs immediately, despite the difficulty.",CO023CL09
1062,119,"Estêvão understood, even though he hadn’t seen anything.",CO023CL09
1063,120,"On his part, Menezes didn’t give any sign. When they were free from the crowd, the deputy began a cheerful conversation with the doctor.",CO023CL09
1064,121,"“What happens to you,” he asked, “when you walk in the middle of so many elegant ladies, with all the confusion of silk and fragrances?”",CO023CL09
1065,122,"Estêvão answered absently, and Menezes continued the conversation in the same style; within five minutes the adventure in the theater had been swept away from his memory.",CO023CL09
1066,123,IV,CO023CL09
1067,124,One day Estêvão Soares was invited to a ball in the house of an old friend of his father.,CO023CL09
1068,125,"Society was pompous and numerous; even though Estêvão was always aloof, he found a great number of female acquaintances there. He didn’t dance; he saw, he talked, he laughed a little and left.",CO023CL09
1069,126,"But when he went in, he had a free heart; when he left, he had an arrow in it, to speak the language of Arcadian poets;13 it was the arrow of love.",CO023CL09
1070,127,"Of love? To tell the truth, tone cannot give such a name to the feeling experienced by Estêvão; it wasn’t love yet, but it could easily turn into it. For the time being it was a sweet and soft feeling of fascination; a woman who was there produced in him the impression that the fairies produced in wandering princes or pursued princesses, according to the old wives’ tales.",CO023CL09
1071,128,"The woman in question wasn’t a virgin; she was a thirty-four year-old widow, as beautiful as the day, gracious and tender. Estêvão saw her for the first time; at least he didn’t remember those facial features. He talked to her for half an hour, and he was so fascinated by Magdalena’s voice, manners and beauty that he couldn’t sleep when he got back home.",CO023CL09
1072,129,"As he was a true doctor, he felt in himself those symptoms of this hypertrophy of the heart called love, and he sought to fight against the nascent illness. He read some Mathematics pages; that is, he ran his eyes over them; because as soon as he began reading, his spirit wandered from the place where only his eyes remained: his spirit went to see the widow.",CO023CL09
1073,130,Tiredness was happier then Euclid; by dawn Estêvão Soares fell asleep.,CO023CL09
1074,131,But he dreamt about the widow.,CO023CL09
1075,132,"He dreamt he was holding her tight in his arms, that he covered her with kisses, that he was her husband before church and society.",CO023CL09
1076,133,"When he woke up and remembered the dream, Estêvão smiled.",CO023CL09
1077,134,“Getting married!” he said. “Just what I needed. How could I be happy with the fearful and ambitious spirit that nature has given me? Let’s stop this; I’ll never see that woman again… and goodnight.”,CO023CL09
1078,135,He began to get dressed.,CO023CL09
1079,136,"They brought him lunch; Estêvão ate quickly, because it was late, and he left to see some patients.",CO023CL09
1080,137,"But when he passed by Rua do Conde he remembered that Magdalena had told him she lived there; but where? The widow had told him the number; the doctor was, however, so absorbed on listening to her that he didn’t memorize it.",CO023CL09
1081,138,"He wanted her and he didn’t; he vowed to forget her, though at that moment he would give everything to get the number of her house.",CO023CL09
1082,139,"Since nobody could tell him, he took the initiative of going away.",CO023CL09
1083,140,"The next day, however, he took care to pass twice down Rua do Conde to see if he could find the fascinating widow. He didn’t find anything; but when he was going to get a tilbury to go back home, he met his father’s friend, in whose house he had met Magdalena.",CO023CL09
1084,141,Estêvao had thought about him already; but he immediately removed the thought because asking where the widow lived was something that could betray him.,CO023CL09
1085,142,Estêvão was already using the verb betray.,CO023CL09
1086,143,"The man in question, after greeting the doctor and exchanging some words with him, said he was going to Magdalena’s house, and took his leave.",CO023CL09
1087,144,Estêvão trembled with satisfaction.,CO023CL09
1088,145,He kept his eyes on his friend and saw him entering a house.,CO023CL09
1089,146,"“It’s there,” he thought.",CO023CL09
1090,147,And quickly walked away.,CO023CL09
1091,148,"When he got home he found a letter addressed to him; the handwriting, which was unknown to him, was drawn with elegance and care; the letter gave off a smell of sandalwood.",CO023CL09
1092,149,The doctor broke the seal.,CO023CL09
1093,150,The letter said:,CO023CL09
1094,151,"Tomorrow there will be tea in my house. If you want to come and spend some hours with us, you’ll give us extreme pleasure. Magdalena C…",CO023CL09
1095,152,"Estêvão read and reread the note; he thought of taking it to his lips, but, ashamed of himself for a thought that seemed like weakness, he only smelled the note and put it in his pocket.",CO023CL09
1096,153,Estêvão was a little fatalist.,CO023CL09
1097,154,"“If I didn’t go to that ball I wouldn’t have met this woman, I wouldn’t be worrying, and I would have conjured up a disgrace or happiness, because both things can be born of this fortuitous encounter. What will it be?",CO023CL09
1098,155,Here I’m with doubt of Hamlet. Should I go to her house? Courtesy calls me to go. I should go; but I’ll go shielded against everything. It’s necessary to break away from these ideas and keep having the peaceful life I’ve had.”,CO023CL09
1099,156,He was in this situation when Menezes arrived at his house. He was coming to take him to dinner. Estêvão left with the deputy. He asked him some curious questions while they were on their way.,CO023CL09
1100,157,For example:,CO023CL09
1101,158,"“Do you believe in fate, my friend? Do you think that there’s a god of good and a god of evil, battling over mankind’s life?”",CO023CL09
1102,159,"“Fate is will,” Menezes answered, “each man makes his own fate.”",CO023CL09
1103,160,"“But after all we have some premonitions… Sometimes, we divine events in which we don’t participate; doesn’t it seem to you that there’s a good god who whispers to us?”",CO023CL09
1104,161,"“You speak like a pagan; I don’t believe in these things. I believe my stomach is empty, and that the best thing we can do is to have dinner here at Hotel de Europa16 instead of going to Rua do Lavradio.”",CO023CL09
1105,162,They went to Hotel de Europa.,CO023CL09
1106,163,"There were many deputies there talking about politics, and who joined Menezes. Estêvão listened and answered, without ever forgetting the widow, the letter and the sandalwood.",CO023CL09
1107,164,That’s how singular contrasts between Estêvão’s thoughts and the general conversation were established.,CO023CL09
1108,165,"For example, a deputy was saying:",CO023CL09
1109,166,"“The government is reactionary; the provinces can’t support it anymore. The principles are all waived; in my province two sub-delegates were fired only because they were my relatives; my brother-in-law, who was a revenue director, was removed from his position, which was given to a rascal who was Valladares’s distant relative. I confess that I’ll break with the opposition tomorrow.”",CO023CL09
1110,167,Estêvão was looking at the deputy; but inside himself he was saying the following:,CO023CL09
1111,168,"“Indeed, Magdalena is beautiful, striklingly beautiful. She has killer eyes. Her hair is gorgeous: everything about her is fascinating. If she could be my wife I’d be happy; but who knows?... However, I feel I’ll love her. It’s already irresistible; it’s necessary to love her, but what about her? What does that invitation mean? Will she love me?”",CO023CL09
1112,169,"Estêvão was so absorbed in this ideal contemplation that when the deputy asked him if he thought the situation was dark and grim, the young man, surrendered to his thoughts, replied:",CO023CL09
1113,170,“It’s gorgeous!”,CO023CL09
1114,171,"“Ah!” the deputy said, “I see you’re a ministerialist.”",CO023CL09
1115,172,Estêvao smiled; but Menezes frowned.,CO023CL09
1116,173,He understood everything.,CO023CL09
1117,174,V,CO023CL09
1118,175,"When they left, the deputy said to the doctor:",CO023CL09
1119,176,"“My friend, you’re disloyal to me…”",CO023CL09
1120,177,"“Why?” Estêvão asked, partly serious, partly smiling, as he didn’t understand the deputy’s observation.",CO023CL09
1121,178,"“Yes,” Menezes continued, “You’re hiding a secret from me.”",CO023CL09
1122,179,“Me?”,CO023CL09
1123,180,“Yes; and it’s a love secret.”,CO023CL09
1124,181,“Ah!...” Estêvão said; “why are you saying this?”,CO023CL09
1125,182,"“I noticed that, while they were talking about politics, you were thinking about a woman, and a gorgeous woman…”",CO023CL09
1126,183,Estêvão understood he was found out; and he didn’t deny it.,CO023CL09
1127,184,"“It’s true, I was thinking about a woman.”",CO023CL09
1128,185,“And will I be the last to know?”,CO023CL09
1129,186,"“But to know what? There isn’t love, there isn’t anything. I met a woman who impressed me and who’s still occupying my thoughts; but it’s possible that it doesn’t go beyond that. Here it is. It’s an interrupted chapter; a novel that stops on its first page. I tell you: for me it will be difficult to love.”",CO023CL09
1130,187,“Why?”,CO023CL09
1131,188,“Do I know? For me it’s hard to believe in love.”,CO023CL09
1132,189,"Menezes stared at Estêvão, smiled, shook his head and said:",CO023CL09
1133,190,"“Look, leave incredulity for those who have already suffered deceptions; you’re young, and you don’t know anything about this feeling yet. At your age nobody’s a skeptic… Moreover, if the woman is beautiful, I bet that after some time you’re going to tell me something different.”",CO023CL09
1134,191,“It may be…” Estêvão replied.,CO023CL09
1135,192,"And at the same time he began to think about Menezes’s words, which he compared to the episode at the Theatro Lyrico.",CO023CL09
1136,193,"However, Estêvão accepted Magdalena’s invitation. He prepared himself and anointed himself as if he were going to talk to a bride. What would come out of that meeting? Would he leave free or captive? Would he be already loved? Estêvão didn’t stop thinking about it; that invitation seemed to be an irrefutable proof to him. Catching a tilbury, the doctor began to build many castles in the air.",CO023CL09
1137,194,He soon arrived at the house.,CO023CL09
1138,195,VI,CO023CL09
1139,196,Magdalena was in the living room with her son.,CO023CL09
1140,197,And nobody else.,CO023CL09
1141,198,It was nine-thirty.,CO023CL09
1142,199,“Have I arrived too early?” he asked the owner of the house.,CO023CL09
1143,200,“You never arrive too early.”,CO023CL09
1144,201,Estêvão bowed.,CO023CL09
1145,202,Magdalena continued:,CO023CL09
1146,203,"“If you find me alone, that’s because, having been a little ill, I dismissed the few people I had invited.”",CO023CL09
1147,204,“Ah! But I didn’t receive…”,CO023CL09
1148,205,“Naturally; I didn’t send to have you told you anything. It was the first time I was inviting you; I didn’t want to keep a distinguished man away from my house.”,CO023CL09
1149,206,"Magdalena’s words weren’t worth anything, not even as an excuse, because the excuse was really weak.",CO023CL09
1150,207,Estêvão soon understood that there was an hidden reason for that.,CO023CL09
1151,208,Could it be love?,CO023CL09
1152,209,"Estêvão thought it was love, and he felt sorry for himself because, despite everything, he dreamt of a more reserved and less rushed passion. He didn’t want to be the object of that preference, even though it pleased him; and more than ever he found himself really embarrassed before a woman he was beginning to love, and who perhaps loved him back. What would he say to her? It was the first time the doctor had found himself in such a plight. There are reasons to suppose that Estêvão, at that moment, preferred to be a hundred leagues away, and but no matter how far, he would be thinking of her.",CO023CL09
1153,210,"Magdalena was excessively beautiful, even though her face showed signs of long suffering. She was tall and full, she had a very beautiful bosom, magnificent arms, big, brown eyes, and a mouth made for a love nest.",CO023CL09
1154,211,"At the moment, she was wearing a black dress.",CO023CL09
1155,212,The color black suited her very well.,CO023CL09
1156,213,Estêvão contemplated that figure with love and adoration; he heard her speaking and was both fascinated and dominated by a feeling he couldn’t explain.,CO023CL09
1157,214,It was a mixture of love and fear.,CO023CL09
1158,215,Magdalena appeared to be delicate and thoughtful. She talked about the young man’s merit as well as his nascent reputation and urged him to visit her sometimes.,CO023CL09
1159,216,"At ten-thirty, tea was served in the tearoom. Estêvão stayed there until eleven o’clock.",CO023CL09
1160,217,"The doctor was completely in love when he got to the street. Magdalena had tied him to her carriage, and the poor young man didn’t even have the will to break loose.",CO023CL09
1161,218,"He was building projects as he walked home: he saw himself married to her, loving her and being loved, making everybody envious, and more than anything, he was happy with himself.",CO023CL09
1162,219,"When he arrived at his house, he remembered to write a letter he would send Menezes the following day. He wrote five letters and tore them all into pieces.",CO023CL09
1163,220,In the end he wrote a simple note in these terms:,CO023CL09
1164,221,"My friend. You’re right; believing is part of my age; I believe and I love. I’ve never thought about that, but it’s true. I love… do you know who? I’ll introduce you in her house. You’ll find her beautiful… If she is!...",CO023CL09
1165,222,"The letter said much more; however, it was just gloss on the same motto.",CO023CL09
1166,223,Estêvão returned to Magdalena’s house and his visits began to be regular and punctilious.,CO023CL09
1167,224,"The widow was so thoughtful toward him that it wasn’t possible to doubt the feeling that guided her. At least this was Estêvão’s opinion. He was almost always alone, and was delighted listening to her. Intimacy began to be established.",CO023CL09
1168,225,"On the very second visit, Estêvão talked about Menezes, asking permission to introduce him. The widow said that it would be a pleasure to welcome Estêvão’s friends; but she asked him to postpone the introduction. All Magdalena’s requests and reasons were good enough for the doctor; he didn’t say anything else.",CO023CL09
1169,226,"Naturally, as the visits to the widow became more assiduous, the visits to his friend were rarer.",CO023CL09
1170,227,Menezes didn’t complain; he understood and communicated his feelings to the young man.,CO023CL09
1171,228,"“Don’t apologize for that,” the deputy added, “it’s natural; friendship should give way to love. I want you to be happy.”",CO023CL09
1172,229,"One day Estêvão asked his friend to tell him the reason that led him to not believe in love, and whether some terrible misfortune had happened to him.",CO023CL09
1173,230,"“Nothing has happened to me,” Menezes said.",CO023CL09
1174,231,"But at the same time, understanding that the doctor deserved all his trust, and that he could absolutely not believe in him, he said:",CO023CL09
1175,232,"“Why should I deny it? Yes, I experienced a great misfortune; I also loved, but I couldn’t find in love the sweetness and the dignity of such a feeling; after all, it’s an intimate drama I don’t want to talk about: to defeat it, control yourself.”",CO023CL09
1176,233,VII,CO023CL09
1177,234,“When you want me to introduce my friend Menezes…” Estêvão was saying one evening to Magdalena.,CO023CL09
1178,235,“Ah! That’s true; one of these days. I see you’re a friend of his.”,CO023CL09
1179,236,“We’re intimate friends.”,CO023CL09
1180,237,“True friends?”,CO023CL09
1181,238,“True friends.”,CO023CL09
1182,239,Magdalena smiled; and as she was playing with her son’s hair she kissed him on the forehead.,CO023CL09
1183,240,The child laughed joyfully and hugged his mother.,CO023CL09
1184,241,"The idea of becoming the little one’s honorary father presented itself to Estêvão’s spirit. He contemplated him, called him, caressed him and gave him a kiss in the same place where Magdalena had landed her lips.",CO023CL09
1185,242,"Estêvão used to play the piano, and sometimes he performed a piece of a song at Magdalena’s request.",CO023CL09
1186,243,"They spent hours and hours there with this and other distractions.
The affair didn’t advance one step.",CO023CL09
1187,244,They both could be two craters ready to burst lava; but until that moment they didn’t show any signs.,CO023CL09
1188,245,This situation was bothering the young man. It shied him away and made him suffer; but when he thought about a decisive attack he became even more of a coward and poltroon.,CO023CL09
1189,246,It was the young man’s first love; he didn’t even know the proper words to define this feeling.,CO023CL09
1190,247,"One day, he decided to write the widow a letter.",CO023CL09
1191,248,"“It’s better,” he thought. “The letter is eloquent and has the great advantage of keeping us at a distance.”",CO023CL09
1192,249,He went to his office and began to write the letter.,CO023CL09
1193,250,He spent an hour doing this; each sentence occupied him a long time. Estêvão wanted to run away from the hypothesis of being classified as fool or sensual. He didn’t want the letter to breathe either frivolous or evil feelings: he wanted to revel himself as pure as he was.,CO023CL09
1194,251,But on what circumstances do events depend upon sometimes? Estêvão was rereading and patching the letter when a young man who had some intimacy with him entered the house. His name was Oliveira and he had the reputation of being the prime dandy of Rio de Janeiro.,CO023CL09
1195,252,He entered with a roll of paper in his hand.,CO023CL09
1196,253,Estêvão quickly hid the letter.,CO023CL09
1197,254,"“Hello, Estêvão!” the newcomer said. “Were you writing a libel or a love letter?”",CO023CL09
1198,255,"“Neither one nor the other,” Estêvão replied dryly.",CO023CL09
1199,256,“I have news for you.”,CO023CL09
1200,257,“What is it?”,CO023CL09
1201,258,“I’ve gotten into literature.”,CO023CL09
1202,259,“Ah!”,CO023CL09
1203,260,"“It’s true, and I’m coming to read you my first comedy.”",CO023CL09
1204,261,"“God forbid!” Estêvão said, standing up.",CO023CL09
1205,262,"“You’ll hear, my friend; at least two scenes; wouldn’t I be your protégé in the literary scene? Come on; at least two scenes. Yes? It’s a little thing.”",CO023CL09
1206,263,Estêvão sat down.,CO023CL09

1287,344,"Estêvão violently interrupted the reading, an attitude that really displeased the novice poet. The poor candidate to the muses could hardly babble a plea; Estêvão was deaf to it, and allowed him to leave the comedy behind so that he could read it afterwards.",CO023CL09
1288,345,"Oliveira was content with that; but he didn’t go away without reciting a speech of the tragedy’s protagonist, in tough and long verses, breaking it with a stanza of poetry, in the style of Victor Hugo’s Djinns.",CO023CL09
1289,346,He finally left.,CO023CL09
1290,347,"However, time had passed.",CO023CL09
1291,348,"Estêvão reread the letter and still wanted to send it; but the poet’s interruption was fruitful; rereading the letter, Estêvão thought it was cold and empty; its language was fiery, but it didn’t correspond to the fire that was burning his heart.",CO023CL09
1292,349,"“It’s useless,” he said, tearing the letter into a thousand pieces. “Human language will always be impotent to express certain affections of the soul; all of that was cold and different from what I feel. I’m condemned to say nothing or say it in a bad way. Before her I don’t have any strength, I feel weak…”",CO023CL09
1293,350,"Estêvão stopped in front of the window which faced the street in the moment an old colleague was passing by, arm-in-arm with his wife, a beautiful wife whom he’d married a month earlier.",CO023CL09
1294,351,The couple was happy and joyful.,CO023CL09
1295,352,Estêvão contemplated that picture with sorrow and adoration. Marriage wasn’t for him that impossibility he talked about when he had only ideas and not feelings. Now it was an achievable happiness.,CO023CL09
1296,353,The passing couple gave him new strength.,CO023CL09
1297,354,"“I have to end this,” he said; “I can’t fail to go to that woman and tell her that I love her, that I adore her, that I want to be her husband. She’ll love me if she doesn’t already: yes, she loves me…”",CO023CL09
1298,355,And he began to get dressed.,CO023CL09
1299,356,"When he was putting his gloves on and glancing at the clock, the servant brought him a letter.",CO023CL09
1300,357,It was from Magdalena.,CO023CL09
1301,358,"I hope, my dear doctor, that you don’t fail to come here today; yesterday I waited for you in vain. I want to talk to you.",CO023CL09
1302,359,Estêvão finished reading this note on the stairs as he hurried down with great urgency to get to the widow’s house.,CO023CL09
1303,360,He didn’t want to miss that outburst of courage.,CO023CL09
1304,361,He left.,CO023CL09
1305,362,"Magdalena was by the window when he arrived at her house. She welcomed him with her usual kindness. Estêvão excused himself as best he could for not being able to go there the previous day, adding that he had been absent with a regret in his heart.",CO023CL09
1306,363,"Would he have a better occasion to drop the bomb of a sincere and passionate love declaration? Estêvão hesitated for a few seconds; but, taking courage, he was going to continue the sentence when the widow said:",CO023CL09
1307,364,"“I was anxious to see you so that I can tell you an important thing, which can only be confided to a man of honor like you.”",CO023CL09
1308,365,Estêvão turned pale.,CO023CL09
1309,366,“Do you know where I saw you for the first time?”,CO023CL09
1310,367,“In the ball of ***.”,CO023CL09
1311,368,"“No, it was before this occasion; it as at Theatro Lyrico.”",CO023CL09
1312,369,“Ah!”,CO023CL09
1313,370,“I saw you there with your friend Menezes.”,CO023CL09
1314,371,“We went there a few times.”,CO023CL09
1315,372,"Magdalena began a long exposition, which the young man heard without blinking, but pale and shaken by inner commotions. These were the widow’s last words:",CO023CL09
1316,373,"“As you can see, sir; only a great soul can hear these things. The poor ones wouldn’t understand them. If I deserve something from you and if this confidence can be paid with a benefit, I’ll ask you to do what I requested.”",CO023CL09
1317,374,The doctor passed his hands over his eyes and just murmured:,CO023CL09
1318,375,“But…”,CO023CL09
1319,376,At that moment Magdalena’s little son entered the room; the widow stood up and brought him by the hand to the place where Estêvão Soares was.,CO023CL09
1320,377,"“If you can’t do it for me,” she said, “do it for this innocent child!”",CO023CL09
1321,378,"The child, without understanding anything, threw himself into Estêvão’s arms.",CO023CL09
1322,379,The young man kissed him on his forehead and said to the widow:,CO023CL09
1323,380,“If I have hesitated it wasn’t because I doubted what you just told me; it was because the mission is thorny; but I promise I’ll fulfill it.”,CO023CL09
1324,381,XI,CO023CL09
1325,382,"With trembling steps and blurred vision, Estêvão left the widow’s house shaken by several feelings. The conversation with the widow had been a long struggle; the last promise was a decisive and fatal blow. Estêvão was leaving the house as a man who had just finished killing his blossoming hopes; he walked at random, needing fresh air and wishing he could retire to a dark room; he wanted to be alone and in the middle of a huge crowd at the same time.",CO023CL09
1326,383,"On his way he met Oliveira, the novice poet.",CO023CL09
1327,384,"He remembered that the reading of the comedy prevented him from sending the letter, and therefore saved him from a very sad disillusionment.",CO023CL09
1328,385,Estêvão involuntarily hugged the poet with all the effusion of his soul.,CO023CL09
1329,386,"The hug was reciprocated by Oliveira, who said the following as soon as he could disentangle from the doctor:",CO023CL09
1330,387,"“Thank you, my friend; these manifestations are very honorable to me; I’ve always known you as a perfect literary judge, and the proof you’re giving me is both a consolation and an encouragement; it consoles me from what I’ve been suffering, and encourages for new commitments. If Torquato Tasso…”",CO023CL09
1331,388,"In the face of this threat of a speech, and especially seeing the interpretation of his hug, Estêvão decided to continue his way, abandoning the poet.",CO023CL09
1332,389,"“Goodbye, I’m in a hurry.”",CO023CL09
1333,390,"“Goodbye, and thank you!”",CO023CL09
1334,391,"Estêvão arrived home and threw himself onto his bed. Nobody ever knew, only the bedroom’s walls witnessed, but the truth is that Estêvão cried bitter tears.",CO023CL09
1335,392,"After all, what did Magdalena tell him, and what were her demands?",CO023CL09
1336,393,"The widow wasn’t a widow; she was Menezes’s wife; she had come from the north months before her husband, who only came as a deputy. Menezes, who loved her madly, and was also loved with equal delirium, accused her of infidelity; a letter and a portrait were the evidence. She denied it but explained herself badly; the husband separated from her and sent her to Rio de Janeiro.",CO023CL09
1337,394,"Magdalena accepted the situation with resignation and courage: she didn’t murmur or ask for anything, and she followed her husband’s order.",CO023CL09
1338,395,"However, Magdalena wasn’t a criminal; her crime was an appearance; she was condemned by honorable fidelity. The letter and the portrait didn’t belong to her; they were only an imprudent and fateful deposit. Magdalena could tell everything, but she would betray a promise; she didn’t want to, and preferred that the domestic storm fall solely on her.",CO023CL09
1339,396,"Now, however, the need for secrecy was over; Magdalena received a letter from the north in which her friend, on her deathbed, asked her to discard the letter and the portrait, or to return them to the man who had given them to her. This letter was a justification.",CO023CL09
1340,397,"Magdalena could send the letter to her husband, or ask him for a meeting; but she feared everything; she knew it would be useless because Menezes was extremely severe.",CO023CL09
1341,398,"She saw the doctor one evening at the theater in the company of her husband; she inquired and discovered that they were friends; therefore, she was asking him to be a mediator between the two, that he saved her and rebuilt a family.",CO023CL09
1342,399,"Thus, Estêvão’s love wasn’t the only thing suffering; his self-esteem also. Estêvão easily understood that he wasn’t attracted to her house because of something else. It’s true that the letter only arrived the day before; but it only came to hasten the resolution. Magdalena would naturally have asked him a service like that even if she hadn’t received the letter.",CO023CL09
1343,400,"If the involved man had been someone else, Estêvão would have refused the task the widow had requested, but it was about his friend, a man to whom he owed the esteem and favors of friendship.",CO023CL09
1344,401,So he accepted the cruel mission.,CO023CL09
1345,402,"“Fate will be fulfilled,” he said; “I’ll throw the woman I love into another man’s arms; and for a greater disgrace, instead of enjoying the reestablishment of domestic harmony, I see myself in the tough situation of loving my friend’s wife, which means I’ll have to go away…”",CO023CL09
1346,403,Estêvão didn’t leave his house that day.,CO023CL09
1347,404,"He wanted to write to the deputy telling him everything; but he thought it was better to tell him face to face. Even though it would cost him more, it was more effective for the fulfillment of his promise.",CO023CL09
1348,405,"However, he postponed it for the following day, or rather for the same day, because the night didn’t interrupt time, as Estêvão didn’t sleep a single minute.",CO023CL09
1349,406,X,CO023CL09
1350,407,The poor lover got up from his bed without having slept. The sun was rising.,CO023CL09
1351,408,He wanted to read the newspapers and asked for them.,CO023CL09
1352,409,"He was putting them aside, having finished reading them, when he suddenly saw his name printed in the Jornal do Commercio.",CO023CL09
1353,410,"It was an article on request, with the title of A masterpiece.",CO023CL09
1354,411,The article said:,CO023CL09
1355,412,"We have the pleasure to announce to the country the next appearance of an excellent comedy, the premiere of a young fluminense littérateur named Antônio Carlos de Oliveira.",CO023CL09
1356,413,"This robust talent, for a long time incognito, will finally enter the seas of publicity, and that’s why he soon sought to experiment with a work of certain importance.",CO023CL09
1357,414,"It appears to us that the author, requested by his many friends, read the comedy days ago at Dr. Estêvão Soares’s house, before a luminous audience, who applauded him very much and prophesied Mr. Oliveira a future Shakespeare.",CO023CL09
1358,415,"Dr. Estêvão Soares used his kindness to the point of asking for a second reading of the comedy, and when he met Mr. Oliveira on the street yesterday, he was so enthusiastic that he hugged him tightly, to great astonishment of the many passersby.",CO023CL09
1359,416,"As that comes from a really competent judge in literary matters, this is an honorable act for Mr. Oliveira.",CO023CL09
1360,417,"We look forward to read Mr. Oliveira’s play, and we’re sure that it will make a fortune for any theater.",CO023CL09
1361,418,The friend of literature.,CO023CL09
1362,419,"Despite the feelings that shook him, Estêvão was angry at the article he had just read. There wasn’t any doubt that its author was the author of the comedy himself. The hug on the previous day had been misinterpreted, and the great poet was using it to favor himself. If at least he hadn’t mentioned Estêvão’s name, he could even forgive the writer’s bit of vanity. But his name figured as an accomplice to the work.",CO023CL09
1363,420,"Putting the Jornal do Commercio aside, Estêvão remembered to protest, and he was going to write an article when he received a short letter from Oliveira.",CO023CL09
1364,421,The letter said:,CO023CL09
1365,422,My dear Estêvão.,CO023CL09
1366,423,"A friend of mine remembered to write something about my play. I explained to him about the reading in your house, and told him how, in spite of your lively desire to listen to the reading, you interrupted me to take care of a patient. Despite all this, my friend told the story today in Jornal do Commercio, changing the truth just a little. I apologize for this; it’s the language of benevolence and friendship.",CO023CL09
1367,424,"Yesterday, I came home so proud with your hug that I wrote an ode, and my lyrical vein manifested this way, after the comic and the tragic veins. I’m sending you the draft; if it’s not good, tear it up.",CO023CL09
1368,425,"The letter had, by mistake, the date of the previous day.",CO023CL09
1369,426,The ode was too long; Estêvão didn’t even read it; he threw it in a corner.,CO023CL09
1370,427,The ode began thus:,CO023CL09
1371,428,"Leave your mount, oh, muse!",CO023CL09
1372,429,Come and inspire the poet’s lyre;,CO023CL09

1384,441,"As he had promised, Estêvão went to look for the deputy Menezes immediately. Instead of going directly to the point, he wanted to delve into his past. It was the first time the young man had touched upon this subject. Menezes wasn’t suspicious, but he thought the attitude was strange; but such was his confidence in the young man that he didn’t refuse talking about anything.",CO023CL09
1385,442,"“I’ve always imagined,” Estêvão said, “that there’s a drama in your life. And perhaps I’m deceived, but the truth is that I still haven’t lost this idea.”",CO023CL09

1389,446,“Why not?”,CO023CL09
1390,447,“I’ll tell you. I’m a politician and I’m not. I didn’t enter public life by vocation; I entered as one enters a grave: to sleep better. Why did I do that? The reason is the drama you’re talking about.”,CO023CL09

1392,449,"“Yes, a woman.”",CO023CL09

1414,471,"When he arrived home, he wrote the deputy a long letter, urging him to restore his family, which had been undone and separated for a moment. Estêvão was eloquent; Menezes’s heart needed little to be satisfied.",CO023CL09
1415,472,"Finally, in this diplomatic mission, the doctor was supremely skillful. After a few days, the clouds of the past dissipated, and the couple was reunited.",CO023CL09

1424,481,But next day Menezes received this note:,CO023CL09

1428,485,"When Menezes returned home, he communicated his impressions to his wife and asked if she understood the situation.",CO023CL09
1429,486,"“No,” Magdalena answered.",CO023CL09

A mutual friend introduced them, and they parted at the end of the evening, exchanging visiting cards and saying that if ever they could be of service to each other, etc., etc.",CO023CL10
1439,4,"Just two months later, they met again.",CO023CL10
1440,5,"Estêvão Soares had to go to the house of a government minister to sort out some paperwork for a provincial relative of his, and there he met Mene­ses, who was just coming out of a meeting.",CO023CL10
1441,6,"They were both genuinely pleased to meet each other again, and Meneses managed to make Estêvão promise to come to his house a few days later.",CO023CL10
1442,7,"The minister in question dealt with the young doctor’s request very quickly, but when Estêvão was ready to leave, he was faced by a heavy downpour, with the rain beginning to run in torrents down the street.",CO023CL10
1443,8,"He looked to left and right for an empty cab, but in vain; all the carriages that passed were occupied.",CO023CL10
1444,9,"There was only one empty carriage, apparently waiting for someone, presumably the deputy.",CO023CL10
1445,10,"A few minutes later, that representative of the nation appeared and was surprised to find the doctor still at the door.",CO023CL10
1446,11,"“It’s raining so heavily,” said Estêvão, “I can’t really leave and so I’ve been waiting here in case an empty cab came by.”",CO023CL10

1462,27,"Although already conscious of the deputy’s solicitous manner, Estêvão was completely taken aback to hear him speak of the novel of their friendship. The reason for this was simple. The friend who had introduced them at the theater had said to him the following day:",CO023CL10
1463,28,"“Meneses is a real misanthrope, a skeptic; he believes in nothing and respects no one. In politics as in society, he plays a purely negative role.”",CO023CL10
1464,29,"Despite his real liking for the deputy, it was with these words in mind that Estêvão spoke to him for the second time, and he was astonished by everything about him, by Meneses’s manner and by his words and the affectionate nature these seemed to reveal.",CO023CL10
1465,30,He replied to the deputy with equal frankness.,CO023CL10
1466,31,"“Why should we end at the first chapter?” he asked. “A friend is never something to be scorned, but welcomed like a gift from the gods.”",CO023CL10
1467,32,"“From the gods!” said Meneses, laughing. “I see you are a pagan.”",CO023CL10
1468,33,"“Somewhat, yes, but in the good sense of the word,” answered Estêvão, also laughing. “My life is a little like Odysseus’s life.”",CO023CL10

1470,35,“Neither one nor the other.”,CO023CL10
1471,36,“Then we will get along famously.”,CO023CL10
1472,37,"And with that, the deputy turned away to watch the rain streaming down the carriage window.",CO023CL10
1473,38,"A few minutes passed, during which Estêvão was at liberty to study his traveling companion.",CO023CL10
1474,39,Meneses turned around then and began another topic of conversation.,CO023CL10
1475,40,"When the carriage entered Rua do Lavradio, Meneses said to the doctor:",CO023CL10
1476,41,“This is where I live. My house is just here. Promise you’ll come and visit me occasionally.”,CO023CL10
1477,42,“I’ll come tomorrow.”,CO023CL10
1478,43,“Good. And how is your medical practice going?”,CO023CL10
1479,44,"“Oh, I’m only just starting,” said Estêvão, “and I don’t have much work as yet, but I hope to make something of it eventually.”",CO023CL10
1480,45,“The colleague who introduced us told me that you’re a young man of great merit.”,CO023CL10
1481,46,"“Well, I certainly hope to make a contribution to society.”",CO023CL10
1482,47,"Ten minutes later, the carriage stopped outside a house in Rua do Lavradio.",CO023CL10
1483,48,They both got out and went inside.,CO023CL10
1484,49,"Meneses showed Estêvão his study, which was furnished with two long bookshelves.",CO023CL10
1485,50,"“This is my family,” said the deputy, showing him the books. “History, philosophy, poetry, and a few books on politics. This is where I work and study. Whenever you come here, this is where I’ll receive you.”",CO023CL10
1486,51,"Promising to return the following day, Estêvão went downstairs to the carriage, which was waiting to take him to Rua da Misericórdia.",CO023CL10
1487,52,"When he arrived home, Estêvão was saying to himself:",CO023CL10
1488,53,"“In what way is this man a misanthrope? A misanthrope would be gruff and rude, unless, of course, he has proved more fortunate than Diogenes and found in me the honest man he’s been looking for.”",CO023CL10
1489,54,II,CO023CL10
1490,55,"Estêvão was a serious fellow. He had talent, ambition, and a desire for knowledge, all powerful weapons in the hands of a man aware of his own potential. His life had been one of deep, constant, uninterrupted study since he was sixteen years old. When Estêvão enrolled in medical school, he did so rather reluctantly, not wishing to disobey his father. His true vocation was for mathematics. What does it matter? he thought when he learned of his father’s intentions for him: I will study medicine and mathematics. And he did indeed find time for both, and even found time to study literature, so that the principal works of antiquity and those of contemporary writers were as familiar to him as treatises on surgical operations and hygiene.",CO023CL10
1491,56,"All this studying brought with it a certain diminution in his health. At twenty-four, Estêvão was thinner than he had been at sixteen; he was very pale and his head jutted forward slightly from his long habit of reading. However, these vestiges of intellectual dedication had not affected the regularity and harmony of his features, nor had his eyes lost any of their brightness and expressiveness despite long hours bent over books.",CO023CL10
1492,57,"He possessed, besides, a natural elegance; not that he was a dandy; his elegance lay in his manner, his attitude, his smile, his clothes, all of which were combined with a certain rigor, which was the cornerstone of his character. While he may often have broken the rules of fashion, no one could ever have accused him of breaking the code of the gentleman.",CO023CL10
1493,58,"He had lost his parents when he was only twenty, but had enough common sense to continue alone on his journey into the world. Studying became his refuge and his support. He knew nothing of love. He had been so focused on filling his mind that he had forgotten he had a heart. Do not, however, infer from this that Estêvão was a positivist.",CO023CL10
1494,59,"On the contrary, his soul still had the two wings nature had given him in all their grace and strength. He would often break out of the prison of the flesh to fly up into the heavens, in search of some obscure, uncertain, ill-defined ideal. When he returned from these ecstasies, he would recover from them by burying himself in books, in search of some scientific truth. Newton was his antidote to Goethe.",CO023CL10
1495,60,"Apart from this, Estêvão did have some rather unusual ideas. His friend, a priest of about thirty, was a keen disciple of François Fénelon and admirer of his Adventures of Telemachus. Now, this priest would often tell Estêvão that he lacked only one thing in order to be complete, and that was to marry. He would say:",CO023CL10
1496,61,"“When you have a beloved and loving wife by your side, you will be a complete and happy man. You will then divide your time between the two loftiest things given to us by nature, our intelligence and our heart. On that day, I want to be the one to bind you together in matrimony . . .”",CO023CL10
1497,62,"“In that case, Father Luís,” Estêvão would say, “bring me both wife and blessing.”",CO023CL10
1498,63,"The priest would smile at this answer, and since that smile seemed to Estêvão to beg another question, he would go on:",CO023CL10
1499,64,"“If I ever find a woman as complete as I would like, I promise that I will marry. However, as you yourself would say: all human works are imperfect, and I certainly wouldn’t argue with you there, Father Luís; allow me, therefore, to walk alone with my own imperfections.”",CO023CL10
1500,65,"A heated debate would then ensue, which would grow livelier and livelier until the point when Estêvão would conclude thus:",CO023CL10
1501,66,"“Father Luís, a girl who leaves aside her dolls in order to learn by heart a few ill-chosen books; who interrupts a lesson in order to hear a description of a love scene; who, as regards art, knows only Paris fashion figurines; who cannot wait to go to a ball, and who, before she falls in love with a man, first makes sure his tie is correct and his boots a perfect fit; Father Luís, this girl could easily become a splendid ornament to a salon or even a fecund mother, but she could never be a wife.”",CO023CL10
1502,67,"This statement had the defect of all absolute rules, which is why Father Luís would always say:",CO023CL10
1503,68,"“You’re quite right, but I’m not telling you to marry the rule; look for the exception to that rule and take her to the altar, where I will be waiting to perform the marriage ceremony.”",CO023CL10
1504,69,"Such were Estêvão’s views on love and women, and these feelings came to him in part from nature, but also from books. He demanded the intellectual and moral perfection of an Héloïse, taking the exception to prove the rule. He was intolerant of any venial sins, not even recognizing them as such. There are no venial sins, he would say, when it comes to manners and love.",CO023CL10
1505,70,"Estêvão’s own family had contributed to this rigidity of spirit. Until his twentieth year, he had seen the sanctity of love sustained by domestic virtue. His mother, who had died when she was thirty-eight, had loved her husband to the last, and survived him by only a few months.",CO023CL10
1506,71,"Estêvão knew that his parents’ love for each other had been ardent and keen when they were engaged and during the early years of their marriage too; but in the later years of their marriage, which he had witnessed, he had seen a calm, solicitous, trusting love, full of devotion and respect, practiced almost as a religion, free from recriminations or resentments, and as deep as it had been on the very first day. Estêvão’s parents died beloved and happy in the tranquil serenity of marital duty.",CO023CL10
1507,72,"To Estêvão’s mind, the love that founds a family should be just that and nothing else. This was only right and proper, but Estêvão’s intolerant views began with his conviction that the last family had died with his own family, and with it the last tradition of love. What would it take to bring down that system, even momentarily? The tiniest of things: a smile and two eyes.",CO023CL10
1508,73,"However, when those two eyes did not appear, Estêvão devoted most of his time to his scientific studies, filling any free moments with distractions that required little concentration.",CO023CL10
1509,74,"He lived alone; he had a slave, who was the same age as him and had been brought up in his father’s house, and who was more brother than slave as regards devotion and affection. He had a few friends and, now and then, they would visit him and he, them. Among these was the young Father Luís, whom Estêvão called the Plato of the cassock.",CO023CL10
1510,75,"Naturally kind and affectionate, generous and chivalrous, devoid of any rancorous or hateful feelings, an enthusiast for all things good and true, this was Dr. Estêvão Soares at the age of twenty-four.",CO023CL10
1511,76,"We have already said something about his physical appearance; we need only add that he had a handsome head, thick brown hair, bright, observant brown eyes, and a naturally curly mustache that stood out in marked contrast to his pale face. He was also tall and had an admirable pair of hands.",CO023CL10
1512,77,III,CO023CL10
1513,78,Estêvão Soares visited Meneses the following day.,CO023CL10
1514,79,"The deputy was expecting him and received him as if he were an old friend. Estêvão had unwittingly arranged to visit at a time that prevented Meneses from attending the Chamber, not that he minded; he simply didn’t go. However, he was delicate enough not to mention this to Estêvão.",CO023CL10
1515,80,Meneses was in his study when the houseboy announced the doctor’s arrival. He went to greet him at the door.,CO023CL10
1516,81,"“As punctual as a king,” he said gaily.",CO023CL10
1517,82,“Of course. I wouldn’t want you to think I’d forgotten.”,CO023CL10
1518,83,“I’m grateful to you.”,CO023CL10
1519,84,They both sat down.,CO023CL10
1520,85,“I’m grateful because I was afraid you might have misunderstood me and that my feelings of friendship for you might not merit any consideration on your part . . .”,CO023CL10
1521,86,Estêvão was about to protest.,CO023CL10
1522,87,"“Forgive me,” Meneses went on, “I see that I was wrong, and that’s why I’m so grateful. At forty-seven, I’m no longer a boy, and for someone of your age, friendship with a man like me is no longer of any value.”",CO023CL10
1523,88,"“Old age, when it’s respectable, should be respected, and loved when it’s lovable. Besides, you’re not old. True, your hair is turning gray, but it’s more as if you were embarking on a second youth.”",CO023CL10
1524,89,“Is that how I seem to you?”,CO023CL10
1525,90,"“You not only seem so, you are.”",CO023CL10
1526,91,"“Whatever the truth of the matter,” said Meneses, “the fact is that we can be friends. How old are you?”",CO023CL10
1527,92,“Twenty-four.”,CO023CL10
1528,93,"“Goodness, young enough to be my son. Are your parents still alive?”",CO023CL10
1529,94,“They both died four years ago.”,CO023CL10
1530,95,“And I seem to recall you telling me you were single . . .”,CO023CL10
1531,96,"“Yes, I am.”",CO023CL10
1532,97,“So you’re free to concentrate solely on science?”,CO023CL10
1533,98,“Science is my wife.”,CO023CL10
1534,99,"“Yes, your intellectual wife, but that can’t be enough for a man like you. There’s plenty of time for that, though; you’re still young.”",CO023CL10
1535,100,"As they spoke, Estêvão was studying and observing Meneses, whose face was lit by the light coming in through one of the windows. There was something austere about his head, with its mane of graying, elegantly disheveled hair. His eyes were dark and rather dull, but one could sense they had once been lively and passionate. His grizzled side-whiskers were like those worn by Lord Palmerston, at least according to the engravings. His face was unlined, apart from a single crease between his eyebrows, a sign of concentration rather than a trace left by time.",CO023CL10
1536,101,"He had a high forehead, and his chin and cheekbones were slightly prominent. You could tell that in his first youth he must have been handsome, and that in old age he would look imposing and august. He smiled occasionally, and that smile, even though his face was not that of an old man, made a very strange impression; it was like a shaft of moonlight falling on an ancient ruin. His smile was pleasant, but devoid of joy.",CO023CL10
1537,102,"There was something impressive and attractive about him, and Estêvão felt more and more drawn to this man who sought his company and held out the hand of friendship to him.",CO023CL10
1538,103,"The conversation continued in the same affectionate tone in which it had begun; the first encounter between friends is the very opposite of the first encounter between lovers; in the latter, silence speaks volumes; in the former, you inspire and gain each other’s confidence by a frank exposition of feelings and ideas.",CO023CL10
1539,104,"They did not talk about politics. Estêvão made a brief allusion to Meneses’s duties as a deputy, but it was a passing comment to which the deputy paid no attention.",CO023CL10
1540,105,"After an hour, Estêvão got up to leave; he had to go and see a patient.",CO023CL10
1541,106,"“That is the most sacred of reasons, otherwise I would keep you here longer.”",CO023CL10
1542,107,"“I’ll come again, though.”",CO023CL10
1543,108,"“You certainly will, and I’ll return the visit occasionally too. If, that is, you’re not fed up with me after two weeks . . . Look, come in the evening; have supper with me; once I’ve finished at the Chamber, I’m completely free.”",CO023CL10
1544,109,Estêvão agreed to all these proposals.,CO023CL10
1545,110,"And he did go back and twice had supper with the deputy, who also visited him at home; they went to the theater together and became on good terms with the various families of their acquaintance. After a month, they were old friends. They had both taken careful note of each other’s character and feelings. Meneses liked the doctor’s seriousness and good sense; he respected him and accepted his prejudices, applauding the generosity of his ambitions.",CO023CL10
1546,111,"For his part, the doctor saw in Meneses a man who combined the austerity of experience with a gentlemanly amiability, being modest in his manners, cultivated, and sensitive. He found not a trace of the misanthropy he had been warned about. It’s true that, on occasions, Meneses did seem more disposed to listen than to speak, and, at such times, his gaze grew still and somber, as if he were contemplating his own consciousness, rather than looking at any external object. Such moments did not last, however, and Meneses soon reverted to his usual self.",CO023CL10
1547,112,"“He’s not a misanthrope,” thought Estêvão, “but there is some kind of drama going on inside him.”",CO023CL10
1548,113,"This idea took on a certain verisimilitude when, one night at the Teatro Lírico, Estêvão drew Meneses’s attention to a woman dressed in black, who was sitting in a box on the first level.",CO023CL10
1549,114,"“I don’t know that woman,” said Estêvão, “do you?”",CO023CL10
1550,115,"Meneses looked up at the box, studied the woman for a few moments, then said:",CO023CL10
1551,116,"“No, I don’t.”",CO023CL10
1552,117,"The conversation went no further, but the doctor noticed that the woman looked at Meneses twice more, and that Meneses did the same, and that their eyes met.",CO023CL10
1553,118,"At the end of the performance, the two friends walked over to the side corridor where the woman in black had been sitting. Estêvão was curious—the curiosity of an artist: he wanted to see her from close up The door to her box was shut. Had she already left? It was impossible to know. Meneses walked by without looking. When they reached the landing of the stairs leading down to the exit onto Rua dos Ciganos, they were both stopped by the great crush of people. Shortly afterward, they heard someone’s hurrying footsteps, and Meneses immediately took Estêvão’s arm and continued on down the stairs despite having to push his way through the throng.",CO023CL10
1554,119,"Estêvão understood, although he had seen nothing.",CO023CL10
1555,120,"For his part, Meneses gave nothing away. As soon as they were free of the crowd, the deputy launched into a lively conversation with the doctor.",CO023CL10
1556,121,"“What effect does it have on you, pushing past all those elegant ladies, through that confusion of silks and perfumes?”",CO023CL10
1557,122,"Estêvão replied distractedly, and Meneses continued the conversation in the same vein. Five minutes later, the incident at the theater was entirely forgotten.",CO023CL10
1558,123,IV,CO023CL10
1559,124,"One day, Estêvão Soares was invited to a ball at the house of an old friend of his father’s.",CO023CL10
1560,125,"It was a large and glittering company, and, although Estêvão led a quiet existence, he knew quite a number of people there. He did not dance, but he looked, talked, laughed a little, and left.",CO023CL10
1561,126,"When he had arrived at the ball, his heart had been utterly free; when he left, however, it was—to adopt the language of the poets of Arcadia—pierced by an arrow, love’s arrow.",CO023CL10
1562,127,"Love? To be honest, that word cannot be used to describe the feeling experienced by Estêvão; it was not yet love, but it could quite easily become love. For the moment, it was a feeling of sweet, gentle fascination; one of the guests had made on him the same impression that fairies make on wandering princes or exiled princesses, at least according to what we read in fairy tales.",CO023CL10
1563,128,"The woman in question was not a maiden; she was a widow of thirty-four, very beautiful, gracious and kind. This was the first time Estêvão had seen her; at least, he could not recall having seen her before. They had talked for half an hour, and he was so enchanted by Madalena’s manners, voice, and beauty that, when he reached home, he was unable to sleep.",CO023CL10
1564,129,"Like the good doctor he was, he noted the symptoms of this hypertrophy of the heart called love and did his best to combat the nascent illness. He read a few pages of a mathematics book, or, rather, he ran his eyes over the pages, because as soon as he started to read, his mind left the book and went off to find the widow.",CO023CL10
1565,130,"Tiredness succeeded where Euclid failed and, toward dawn, Estêvão Soares finally fell asleep.",CO023CL10
1566,131,He dreamed of the widow.,CO023CL10
1567,132,"He dreamed he was holding her in his arms, that he was showering her with kisses, that she was his wife in the eyes of the Church and society.",CO023CL10
1568,133,"When he woke, he remembered the dream and smiled.",CO023CL10
1569,134,"“Get married!” he said. “That’s all I need. How could I, with my naturally shy, ambitious character, how could I possibly be happily married? I’ll think no more about it. I’ll never see that woman again, and that’s that.”",CO023CL10
1570,135,He began getting dressed.,CO023CL10
1571,136,"Breakfast was brought to him, and he ate rapidly because it was late, then went out to see a few patients.",CO023CL10
1572,137,"As he passed Rua do Conde, he remembered that Madalena had told him that this was the street where she lived, but where exactly? She had told him the number, but he had been so entranced by her voice that he had failed to retain this information.",CO023CL10
1573,138,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO023CL10
1574,139,"Since no one could help him, he decided to continue on his way.",CO023CL10
1575,140,"The following day, though, he made a point of walking twice up and down Rua do Conde to see if he could find the charming widow. He found nothing, but just as he was about to take a cab and return home, he bumped into the family friend at whose house he had met Madalena.",CO023CL10
1576,141,"Estêvão had already considered approaching him, but had immediately rejected the thought, because asking him where the widow lived might betray his intentions.",CO023CL10
1577,142,That was the word Estêvão used—betray.,CO023CL10
1578,143,"After greeting the doctor and exchanging a few words with him, the man said goodbye, announcing that he was going to visit Madalena.",CO023CL10
1579,144,Estêvão trembled with satisfaction.,CO023CL10
1580,145,He watched his friend from a distance and saw him go into a house.,CO023CL10
1581,146,"“So that’s where she lives,” he thought.",CO023CL10
1582,147,And he walked briskly away.,CO023CL10
1583,148,"When he got home, he found a letter perfumed with sandalwood; the address was written in a neat, elegant, but unfamiliar hand.",CO023CL10
1584,149,He broke the seal.,CO023CL10
1585,150,This is what the letter said:,CO023CL10
1586,151,We’re having tea at my house tomorrow. It would give us great pleasure if you would care to spend a few hours with us. Madalena C.,CO023CL10
1587,152,"Estêvão read and reread the note; he even made as if to raise it to his lips, but, ashamed of what seemed to him mere weakness, he simply gave the letter a peremptory sniff and put it in his pocket.",CO023CL10
1588,153,Estêvão was something of a fatalist.,CO023CL10
1589,154,"“If I hadn’t gone to that ball, I wouldn’t have met that woman and I wouldn’t be feeling as I do now, and I would have avoided either a misfortune or a joy, because both those things could come from this chance encounter.",CO023CL10
1590,155,"To be or not to be, as Hamlet said. Should I go to her house? It’s only polite, after all. Yes, I must, but I will go prepared for everything. I must break with these ideas and resume my former tranquil existence.”",CO023CL10
1591,156,"He was still thinking all this when Meneses arrived at his house. He had come to take Estêvão out to supper, and they left together. On the way, Estêvão asked Meneses a few strange questions.",CO023CL10
1592,157,For example:,CO023CL10
1593,158,"“Do you believe in fate, my friend? Do you think there is a good god and a bad god constantly engaged in a power struggle over our lives?”",CO023CL10
1594,159,"“Fate is will,” answered Meneses. “Each man makes his own fate.”",CO023CL10
1595,160,“And yet we do have presentiments. Sometimes we have an inkling of events in which we did not even take part. Do you not think perhaps that some beneficent god is telling us these things?”,CO023CL10
1596,161,"“You’re speaking like a pagan, and I don’t believe any of it. I do believe that my stomach is empty and that the best thing we can do is to have supper right here in the Hotel de Europa rather than going back to Rua do Lavradio.”",CO023CL10
1597,162,They went into the hotel.,CO023CL10
1598,163,"Various deputies were there, talking politics, and they all gathered around Meneses. Estêvão listened and responded, but without once forgetting the widow, the letter, and the smell of sandalwood.",CO023CL10
1599,164,There were some interesting contrasts between the general conversation and Estêvão’s thoughts.,CO023CL10
1600,165,"For example, a deputy would say:",CO023CL10
1601,166,"“The government is overreaching itself, and the provinces can’t take much more of it. Principle has been tossed out of the window. In my province alone, some subdelegates have been dismissed simply because they’re relatives of mine; my son-in-law, who was director of finances, was thrown out and the post given to some dandy who’s related by marriage to the Valadar family. I tell you I’m really going to lay into the opposition tomorrow.”",CO023CL10
1602,167,"Estêvão was looking at the deputy who was speaking, but in his head, he was saying this:",CO023CL10
1603,168,"“Madalena really is beautiful, unbelievably beautiful. She has extraordinary eyes. Her hair is gorgeous too; everything about her is fascinating. I would be happy to have her as my wife, but who knows? And yet I feel that I will love her. It’s irresistible. I have to love her. But what about her? What does she mean by that invitation? Does she love me?”",CO023CL10
1604,169,"Estêvão was so immersed in these ideal thoughts, so distracted, that, when a deputy asked him if he didn’t also find the whole situation grim and hopeless, he replied:",CO023CL10
1605,170,"“Oh, yes, gorgeous!”",CO023CL10
1606,171,"“Ah,” said the deputy, “I see you’re on the side of the ministers!”",CO023CL10
1607,172,"Estêvão smiled, but Meneses frowned. He had understood everything.",CO023CL10
1608,173,V,CO023CL10
1609,174,"When they left, the deputy said to the doctor:",CO023CL10
1610,175,"“My friend, you’ve been disloyal to me . . .”",CO023CL10
1611,176,"“Whatever do you mean?” asked Estêvão, half serious and half joking, not having understood the deputy’s remark.",CO023CL10
1612,177,"“Because,” Meneses went on, “you have a secret you’re not telling me.”",CO023CL10
1613,178,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO023CL10
1614,179,“Me?”,CO023CL10
1615,180,"“Yes, a secret love.”",CO023CL10
1616,181,“Why do you say that?”,CO023CL10
1617,182,"“I noticed just now that, while everyone else was discussing politics, you were thinking about a woman, a gorgeous woman.”",CO023CL10
1618,183,"Seeing that he had been found out, Estêvão did not deny it.",CO023CL10
1619,184,“It’s true. I was thinking about a woman.”,CO023CL10
1620,185,“And will I be the last to know?”,CO023CL10
1621,186,"“Know what? There’s no love, nothing. I happened to meet a woman who made a real impression on me, and I’m still thinking about her now. But it may well go no further than that. That’s it. It’s an unfinished chapter; a novel of which there is only the first page. I really think it will be difficult for me to fall in love.”",CO023CL10
1622,187,“Why?”,CO023CL10
1623,188,“I don’t know. I find it hard to believe in love.”,CO023CL10
1624,189,"Meneses looked hard at Estêvão and smiled, shaking his head:",CO023CL10
1625,190,"“Look, leave disbelief to those who have already been disappointed in love; you’re young and as yet know nothing of such disappointments. No one can be a skeptic at your age. Besides, if the woman is pretty, I wager you’ll end up telling me a very different story.”",CO023CL10
1626,191,"“Possibly,” said Estêvão.",CO023CL10
1627,192,"And at the same time, he thought about Meneses’s words, words that reminded him of what had happened at the Teatro Lírico.",CO023CL10
1628,193,"Meanwhile, Estêvão duly went to Madalena’s house. He was as meticulously dressed and perfumed as if he were going to visit his fiancée. What would come of that encounter? Would he emerge a free man or a slave? Estêvão could not help thinking that perhaps she loved him already, and the invitation seemed to him irrefutable proof of this. As he got into a cab, he began to build all kinds of castles in the air.",CO023CL10
1629,194,"At last, he reached her house.",CO023CL10
1630,195,VI,CO023CL10
1631,196,Madalena was alone in the room with her small son.,CO023CL10
1632,197,No one else.,CO023CL10
1633,198,It was half-past nine.,CO023CL10
1634,199,“Am I too early?” he asked.,CO023CL10
1635,200,“You could never be too early.”,CO023CL10
1636,201,"Estêvão bowed,",CO023CL10
1637,202,and Madalena went on:,CO023CL10
1638,203,“The reason I’m alone is because I felt a little unwell earlier and sent messages putting off the handful of people I’d invited.”,CO023CL10
1639,204,“But I didn’t receive a message . . .”,CO023CL10
1640,205,"“That is because I didn’t send you one. It was the first time I’d invited you, and I certainly didn’t want to drive away such a distinguished gentleman.”",CO023CL10
1641,206,Madalena’s words were not even believable as the feeblest of excuses.,CO023CL10
1642,207,Estêvão realized at once that there must be some hidden motive.,CO023CL10
1643,208,Could it be love?,CO023CL10
1644,209,"Estêvão thought that it was, and he was sorry, because, despite everything, he had imagined a more discreet, less precipitate passion. However pleasing this was, he did not want to be the object of her desires, and felt terribly embarrassed to be there with a woman with whom he was beginning to fall in love and who perhaps loved him. What could he say to her? It was the first time he had found himself in such a situation. There is every reason to think that, at the time, Estêvão would have preferred to be a hundred leagues from there, and yet, however far away he was, he would still be thinking about her.",CO023CL10
1645,210,"Madalena was extraordinarily beautiful, and yet her face revealed her to be someone who has suffered greatly. She was tall and strong, and had a beautiful neck, magnificent arms, large brown eyes, and a mouth made for love.",CO023CL10
1646,211,"At that moment, she was wearing a black dress.",CO023CL10
1647,212,Black suited her.,CO023CL10
1648,213,Estêvão gazed on her with love and adoration; he heard her speak and felt enchanted and overwhelmed by a feeling he could not explain.,CO023CL10
1649,214,It was a mixture of love and fear.,CO023CL10
1650,215,"Madalena was tactful and solicitous. She spoke of his many merits and his burgeoning reputation, and urged him to come and visit her occasionally.",CO023CL10
1651,216,"At half-past ten, tea was served, and Estêvão stayed until eleven o’clock.",CO023CL10
1652,217,"By the time he left, he was completely besotted. Madalena had yoked him to her cart, and the poor boy had no wish to cast off that yoke.",CO023CL10
1653,218,"As he walked home, his head was full of plans: he could see himself married to her, beloved and loving, provoking envy everywhere, and, more importantly, happy in himself.",CO023CL10
1654,219,"When he reached his house, he thought he should write a letter to send to Meneses the next day. He wrote five and tore all of them up.",CO023CL10
1655,220,"Finally, he wrote this very simple note:",CO023CL10
1656,221,"My friend, you were quite right; at my age, no one is a skeptic; we believe. I believe and I am in love. I never would have thought it possible, but it’s true. I am in love. Would you like to know who I’m in love with? I will take you to her house. You’ll find her very pretty—because she is!",CO023CL10
1657,222,"The letter said many more things, but they were all basically a gloss on the same idea.",CO023CL10
1658,223,"Estêvão went back to Madalena’s house, and became a regular, assiduous visitor.",CO023CL10
1659,224,"The widow treated him so kindly that it was impossible to doubt the feelings that lay behind that kindness. That at least is what Estêvão thought. She was nearly always alone, and he delighted in listening to her talk. They were growing closer and closer.",CO023CL10
1660,225,"On only his second visit, Estêvão spoke to her about Meneses and asked permission to introduce her to him. She said she would be delighted to receive any of his friends, but asked him to postpone any introductions for the moment. He accepted everything Madalena asked or thought and so said nothing more.",CO023CL10
1661,226,"As was only natural, when his visits to the widow grew more frequent, his visits to his friend became less so.",CO023CL10
1662,227,Meneses did not complain; he understood and said to Estêvão:,CO023CL10
1663,228,"“Don’t apologize, that’s the way things are. Friendship must give way to love. I just want you to be happy.”",CO023CL10
1664,229,"One day, Estêvão asked his friend why he no longer believed in love, and if he had suffered some great misfortune.",CO023CL10
1665,230,"“No, not at all,” said Meneses.",CO023CL10
1666,231,"Then, realizing that the doctor deserved his confidence and might not believe him, he added:",CO023CL10
1667,232,"“No, why deny it? I did suffer a great misfortune. I, too, loved, but did not find sweetness and dignity in love. Anyway, it’s a personal tragedy of which I prefer not to speak. I have to accept it.”",CO023CL10
1668,233,VII,CO023CL10
1669,234,“When would you like me to introduce you to my friend Meneses?” Estêvão asked Madalena one night.,CO023CL10
1670,235,"“Oh, yes, that’s right. Well, one of these days. I see you are a great friend of his.”",CO023CL10
1671,236,"“Yes, we’re very close.”",CO023CL10
1672,237,“True friends?”,CO023CL10
1673,238,"“Yes, true friends.”",CO023CL10
1674,239,"Madalena smiled, continuing to play with her son’s hair, and planting a kiss on his forehead.",CO023CL10
1675,240,The boy laughed gaily and hugged his mother.,CO023CL10
1676,241,"The idea of becoming the child’s honorary father surfaced in Estêvão’s mind. He looked at him, called to him, stroked him, and kissed him on exactly the same spot where Madalena’s lips had rested.",CO023CL10
1677,242,"Estêvão could play the piano and, at Madalena’s request, he would sometimes play something for her.",CO023CL10
1678,243,"In these and other amusements the hours passed; love, however, did not progress one step.",CO023CL10
1679,244,"They could have been two volcanoes ready to erupt, but, so far, there was no sign of this.",CO023CL10
1680,245,"Estêvão found the situation very awkward, discouraging, and painful, but whenever he considered taking decisive action, this was precisely when he revealed himself at his most craven and cowardly.",CO023CL10
1681,246,"It was the first time he had been in love, and he didn’t even know what words to choose.",CO023CL10
1682,247,"One day, he resolved to write to her.",CO023CL10
1683,248,"“That’s the best way,” he thought. “A letter is eloquent and has the great advantage of keeping a certain distance.”",CO023CL10
1684,249,He went into his study and began a letter.,CO023CL10
1685,250,"He spent an hour on this, lingering long over every sentence. He wanted to avoid being classified as either foolish or sensual. He didn’t want the letter to suggest any frivolous or bad feelings; he wanted to show himself as pure as he was.",CO023CL10
1686,251,"Ah, but how often events intervene. Estêvão was still rereading and correcting the letter when a good friend of his arrived. His name was Oliveira and he was said to be Rio de Janeiro’s foremost dandy.",CO023CL10
1687,252,"He entered, carrying a roll of paper.",CO023CL10
1688,253,Estêvão immediately hid his letter.,CO023CL10
1689,254,"“Hello, Estêvão,” said Oliveira. “What were you writing just now? Something libelous or a love letter?”",CO023CL10
1690,255,"“Neither,” Estêvão replied tartly.",CO023CL10
1691,256,“I have some news for you.”,CO023CL10
1692,257,“What?”,CO023CL10
1693,258,“I’ve become a writer.”,CO023CL10
1694,259,“Really?”,CO023CL10
1695,260,"“Yes, and I have come to read you my first comedy.”",CO023CL10
1696,261,"“Oh, please, no!” cried Estêvão, getting up.",CO023CL10
1697,262,"“You must hear at least a few scenes, my friend. Are you not going to encourage me in my new career? Come on, just a couple of scenes. That’s not much to ask.”",CO023CL10
1698,263,Estêvão sat down again.,CO023CL10
1699,264,The playwright went on:,CO023CL10
1700,265,“Or perhaps you’d prefer to hear a speech from my tragedy entitled Brutus’s Dagger . . .”,CO023CL10

1779,344,"Estêvão brought the reading to an abrupt halt, which greatly upset the novice poet. This poor candidate to the muses tried to plead with him, but Estêvão would not be moved, and the only concession he made was a promise to read the play later.",CO023CL10
1780,345,"Oliveira had to content himself with this, but would not leave until he had recited from memory a speech by the protagonist of his tragedy, long, complicated verses topped off with a stanza of lyric poetry, in the style of Victor Hugo’s “Les Djinns.”",CO023CL10
1781,346,Then he left.,CO023CL10
1782,347,"Meanwhile, time had passed.",CO023CL10
1783,348,"Estêvão reread his letter and still wanted to send it, but his poet friend’s interruption had proved useful, for, on rereading the letter yet again, Estêvão found it cold and empty; the language was very passionate, but in no way did it describe the fire in his heart.",CO023CL10
1784,349,"“It’s pointless,” he said, tearing the letter into pieces, “the human tongue will always be impotent when it comes to expressing certain feelings of the soul; what I wrote was so cold, and quite different from what I actually feel. I’m condemned to say nothing or to say it badly. When I’m with her, I feel too weak, too feeble . . .”",CO023CL10
1785,350,"Estêvão went over to the window just as a former colleague of his was walking past in the street below, arm in arm with a woman, a very pretty woman, whom he had married the month before.",CO023CL10
1786,351,They both looked so happy and content.,CO023CL10
1787,352,"Estêvão contemplated the scene sadly and adoringly. Marriage was no longer the impossibility he had spoken of when he had only ideas, not feelings. Now it was something that could become a reality.",CO023CL10
1788,353,The couple who had just passed gave him new energy.,CO023CL10

1792,357,It was from Madalena.,CO023CL10
1793,358,"I do hope, my dear doctor, that you will come and see me today. Yesterday, I waited for you in vain. I need to talk to you.",CO023CL10
1794,359,Estêvão was in such a hurry to leave and wanted so urgently to be with Madalena that he only finished reading this note when he was halfway down the stairs.,CO023CL10
1795,360,What he didn’t want to lose was that glimmer of courage.,CO023CL10
1796,361,He left.,CO023CL10
1797,362,"When he reached Madalena’s house, she was standing at the window, watching for him. She welcomed him warmly, as she always did. Estêvão apologized as best he could for failing to appear on the previous evening, adding that it had pained him deeply not to be there.",CO023CL10
1798,363,"What better opportunity to throw in the bombshell of a frank and passionate declaration of love? He hesitated for a few seconds longer, then, screwing up all his courage, he was about to go on, when she said to him:",CO023CL10

1800,365,Estêvão turned pale.,CO023CL10

1806,371,"“Yes, we did go there a few times.”",CO023CL10
1807,372,"Madalena then launched into a long explanation, to which he listened unblinking, but, at the same time, turning paler still and feeling deeply troubled. Her final words were:",CO023CL10
1808,373,"“As you see, sir, such things can only be confided to a great soul. Small souls could not understand them. If I deserve anything, and if this confidence can be repaid with a kind act, then I ask you to do as I request.”",CO023CL10
1809,374,The doctor covered his eyes with his hand and said only:,CO023CL10
1810,375,“But—”,CO023CL10
1811,376,"At that moment, Madalena’s little boy came into the room; she got up and led him by the hand to where Estêvão Soares was sitting.",CO023CL10
1812,377,"“If not for me, then for the sake of this innocent child!”",CO023CL10
1813,378,"The child, all uncomprehending, threw himself into Estêvão’s arms.",CO023CL10
1814,379,Estêvão kissed him on the forehead and said to the widow:,CO023CL10
1815,380,"“If I hesitated, it was not because I doubted the truth of what you have just told me, but because it is a very difficult mission you entrust me with. I promise, though, that I will carry it out to the best of my ability.”",CO023CL10
1816,381,IX,CO023CL10
1817,382,"Estêvão left Madalena’s house with unsteady step and clouded gaze and filled with all kinds of contradictory feelings. His conversation with Madalena had been a long ordeal, and that final promise a decisive, mortal blow. Estêvão left there like a man who has just murdered his own burgeoning hopes; he walked aimlessly, he needed both to breathe fresh air and to be in a darkened room, to be alone and, at the same time, in the midst of a vast crowd.",CO023CL10
1818,383,"On the way, he met Oliveira, the novice poet.",CO023CL10
1819,384,He recalled that Oliveira’s reading of his play had prevented him from sending the letter and thereby spared him the saddest of disappointments.,CO023CL10
1820,385,He found himself embracing the poet with all his heart.,CO023CL10
1821,386,"Oliveira returned his embrace, and, when he could finally detach himself from the doctor’s arms, said:",CO023CL10
1822,387,"“Thank you, my friend. Such a show of enthusiasm is most affecting. I have always thought of you as a great judge of literature, and the proof that you have just given me is both a consolation and an encouragement; it consoles me for what I have already suffered, and encourages me to embark on new ventures. If Torquato Tasso—”",CO023CL10
1823,388,"Feeling a speech threatening, and especially given his friend’s misinterpretation of his embrace, Estêvão resolved to continue on his way and to abandon the poet.",CO023CL10
1824,389,"“I’m sorry, I’m in a hurry. Goodbye.”",CO023CL10
1825,390,“Goodbye and thank you!”,CO023CL10
1826,391,Estêvão reached his own house and flung himself down on the bed. No one ever knew this—and only the walls of his room were witnesses—but the truth is that Estêvão wept bitter tears.,CO023CL10
1827,392,So what was it that Madalena had told him and asked of him?,CO023CL10
1828,393,"The widow was not a widow; she was Meneses’s wife. She had traveled down from the North a few months before her husband, who only came to Rio to carry out his duties as a deputy. Meneses, who loved her madly and whose love was requited with equal fervor, had accused her of being unfaithful, citing a letter and a portrait as evidence. She had denied this, but explained herself very badly. Her husband left and sent her off to the capital.",CO023CL10
1829,394,Madalena accepted the situation with resignation and courage; she neither complained nor begged; she did as her husband ordered.,CO023CL10
1830,395,"And yet Madalena was not guilty of the crime, which was only a crime in appearance; she was condemned because she had behaved honorably. The letter and the portrait did not belong to her; they had, imprudently and fatally, been left in her safekeeping. Madalena could have told her husband everything, but that would have meant breaking a promise, and she did not want that. She preferred the domestic storm to fall only on her.",CO023CL10
1831,396,"Now, however, the need to keep the secret had passed. Madalena had received word from the North, in which her friend, on her deathbed, asked her to destroy both the letter and the portrait or to return them to the man who had given them to her. This was enough to justify Madalena’s confession.",CO023CL10
1832,397,"Madalena could have sent the letter to her husband, or asked to meet him, but she was afraid. She knew it would be useless, because Meneses could be very rigid.",CO023CL10
1833,398,"She had seen Estêvão one night at the theater in company with her husband; she had made inquiries and learned that they were friends; she was asking him, then, to mediate between them, to save her and restore a family’s happiness.",CO023CL10
1834,399,"It was not, therefore, only Estêvão’s love that was wounded, it was his amour propre too. He realized at once that he had been invited to that house for one reason alone. It’s true that the letter had only arrived the day before, but this had merely hastened the resolution of the situation. Madalena would doubtless have asked him to perform some similar service even if she hadn’t received the letter.",CO023CL10
1835,400,"Had it been any other man, Estêvão would have refused to help the “widow,” but it was his friend, a man to whom he owed both esteem and the duties of friendship.",CO023CL10
1836,401,And so he accepted that cruel mission.,CO023CL10
1837,402,"“So be it,” he said, “I have to drive the woman I love into the arms of another, and, even worse, far from taking pleasure in being able to restore domestic harmony, I find myself in the dreadful position of being in love with my friend’s wife, and for that there is only one solution—to go far away . . .”",CO023CL10
1838,403,Estêvão stayed at home for the rest of that day.,CO023CL10
1839,404,"He considered writing to the deputy and telling him everything, then thought it would be better to talk to him face-to-face. This would be more difficult, but more effective if he was to keep his promise.",CO023CL10
1840,405,"However, he put this off until the following day, or, rather, the same day, since the night did not interrupt the flow of time, given that he did not sleep a wink.",CO023CL10
1841,406,X,CO023CL10
1842,407,The poor lover left his bed as the sun was rising.,CO023CL10
1843,408,He wanted to read the newspapers and asked for them to be brought to him.,CO023CL10
1844,409,"He was just setting them aside, having read all he wanted, when he suddenly saw his own name in the Jornal do Commercio.",CO023CL10
1845,410,"It was a commissioned article, a puff, entitled A Masterpiece.",CO023CL10
1846,411,This is what the article said:,CO023CL10
1847,412,It is with pleasure that we announce to the nation the imminent appearance of an excellent new comedy written by a young writer from Rio de Janeiro called Antônio Carlos de Oliveira.,CO023CL10
1848,413,"This robust talent, long unrecognized, is finally about to enter the sea of public life, and to this end he wanted to try his hand at writing a substantial work.",CO023CL10
1849,414,"We understand that only days ago, the author, at the request of his many friends, read the play in the house of Dr. Estêvão Soares, before an illustrious audience, who applauded loudly and proclaimed Senhor Oliveira as a future Shakespeare.",CO023CL10
1850,415,"Dr. Estêvão Soares was kind enough to ask to read the play again, and yesterday, when he met Senhor Oliveira in the street, he embraced him warmly, to the general amazement of numerous passersby.",CO023CL10
1851,416,"Coming from such a fine judge of literature, this embrace speaks volumes about Senhor Oliveira’s talent.",CO023CL10
1852,417,We are ourselves keen to read Senhor Oliveira’s play and are sure that it will make the fortune of any theater that puts it on.,CO023CL10
1853,418,A Lover of Literature,CO023CL10
1854,419,"Despite all the other emotions churning inside him, this article enraged Estêvão. There could be no doubt that the author of the article must also be the author of the play. His embrace had been misinterpreted, and the so-called poet had used it to his advantage. If he had at least omitted Estêvão’s name, that might have excused the writer’s foolish vanity, but his name was there as an accomplice to the play.",CO023CL10
1855,420,"Setting aside the newspaper, Estêvão decided to write a letter of protest and was just about to do so, when he received a note from Oliveira.",CO023CL10

1857,422,"Dear Estêvão,",CO023CL10
1858,423,"A friend of mine decided to write something about my play. I told him I had read the play to you, and explained that, despite your keen desire to hear the whole thing, you had to rush off to tend to a patient. Despite this, the aforementioned friend decided to reveal all in today’s Jornal do Commercio, very slightly tampering with the truth. Forgive him: he meant well.",CO023CL10
1859,424,"Yesterday, I arrived home, feeling so proud of your embrace that I wrote an ode, my lyric vein rising to the surface after the comic and the tragic. Here it is—in draft form. If it’s no good, simply tear it up.",CO023CL10
1860,425,The letter bore yesterday’s date.,CO023CL10
1861,426,"The ode was very long, and Estêvão didn’t even bother to read it, but hurled it down.",CO023CL10
1862,427,The ode began thus:,CO023CL10
1863,428,"Leave your mountain peak, O muse!",CO023CL10

Meneses, all unsuspecting, was merely taken a little by surprise; however, such was his confidence in his friend that he could refuse him nothing.",CO023CL10
1877,442,"“I’ve always thought,” Estêvão said, “that there must have been some kind of drama in your life. This may be a mistake on my part, but I can’t get the idea out of my head.”",CO023CL10

1882,447,“I’ll tell you. I both am and am not a politician. I didn’t enter public life out of any kind of vocation; I entered it as one enters a tomb: in order to sleep better. Why did I do this? Because of the drama you speak of.”,CO023CL10

1884,449,"“Yes, a woman.”",CO023CL10

1893,458,"When he heard these words, Meneses gave a faint gasp.",CO023CL10
1894,459,"Then, springing to his feet, he asked Estêvão to tell him what he knew and how.",CO023CL10
1895,460,Estêvão told him everything.,CO023CL10

1943,16,"The major uttered these words while holding his arms out to break the fall the shock would cause the nephew; but to his disappointment, he saw his nephew cheerful, or a bit less dismal than before, though hardly ecstatic. He was affected, to be sure, and he didn’t hide his satisfaction with the news. Little wonder. An inheritance of at least six hundred contos. But thence to dizziness, to the befuddlement the major was expecting, was a tremendous distance. Máximo pulled out a chair and took a seat in front of his uncle.",CO102CL08

1945,18,"“I came to give you the news. It surprised a lot of people; Morais Bicudo, who did everything he could to get the inheritance, ended up with a face a span and a half long. Rumors abounded; some said the fortune was going to Morais, others that it was going to the vicar, and so on. It even went around that one of the slave women would inherit the largest share. Lies! The man died, the will was opened, and out came the declaration that you are the sole heir.",CO102CL08
1946,19,"Máximo, content, listened. This reflection—that the colonel’s death was a delightful thing and that other news could go touch his heart more directly or more profoundly—wormed its way into the most secret corner of his conscience.",CO102CL08

The somber cast to his face later prevailed over the joy of the occasion; and if the major had been a discerning man, he might have noticed a slight expression of bitterness about his lips. But the major was not discerning, and he didn’t look his way, either; he was looking at the black crepe in his hat and rearranging it; then he took leave of the student.",CO102CL08

It was what people called him, since two years earlier, in 1854, word went around that he was going to be made major in the National Guard. A pure fabrication a lot of people thought was real; and insofar as they called him by the title from then on, they made up for the government’s oversight.",CO102CL08

1978,51,"Wrong! Máximo is not having liver trouble; in fact, he has an iron constitution.

1979,52,"Two months earlier, at senhor Alcântara’s house on Rua dos Arcos, he had been introduced. Senhor Alcântara was the father of Eulália, who is the girl in question. The father wasn’t rich; he had a middling job at the Finance Ministry, and he lived with a certain thrift and discretion; he was also married and had only two daughters, Eulália and another who wasn’t even seven years old.

1980,53,"Such was not Eulália’s opinion. She enjoyed talking with him—not a lot—listening to his witticisms, because he was witty and came up with felicitous wisecracks, but nothing more. The day our Máximo dared question Eulália’s gaze, she answered him not at all; in fact, she thought her eyes were deceiving her. The second time there was no doubt; she was certain that the young man liked her and was questioning her. The next day, with some girl cousins of hers, Eulália couldn’t help bringing up the young man’s action.",CO102CL08

1984,57,"The next day, when Máximo went to senhor Alcântara’s house, he was given a chilly reception; he realized he was not loved in returned, but he was not discouraged for that reason. His view was that women are no harder than rocks and that with time the persistence of water overcomes rocks, and there was an even better reason: he was really in love.",CO102CL08
1985,58,"Every day the young man’s passion was heightened, to the point that anything other than marriage—and soon—struck him as inadmissible; he didn’t know how the marriage of a penniless student and a woman who spurned him could take place soon, but desire rarely occupies itself with impossible matters.",CO102CL08
1986,59,"Eulália, to her credit, tried every means, with gestures as well as words, to disabuse the student of his illusions; she spoke little to him, and sometimes rudely. She didn’t look at him, or gave him nothing more than passing, expressionless glances.",CO102CL08
1987,60,"She no longer acclaimed, as she once had, the poems he would go read at her father’s house, and much less would she ask him to recite others, the way the cousins did; they always recalled a “Reverie,” a “Sigh by Moonlight,” “Your Eyes,” “The Girl,” “My Life for a Look,” and other offenses of like gravity, which the reader can buy now for six hundred réis, in paperback, on Rua de São José, or for three hundred réis without the frontispiece.",CO102CL08

1991,64,"Despite this refusal and all the others, Máximo still had hopes of triumphing at last over Eulália’s resistance, and he still had them for no reason other than that his passion was real and intense, feeding on itself, and exacerbated by a feeling of wounded pride. The young man was humiliated, and to forgive he required utter obedience. Imagine, then, what his nights in the little room on Rua da Misericórdia must have been after the daily snubbing he was subjected to.",CO102CL08
1992,65,"The night before the day Major Bento came from Iguaçu to give his nephew the news of his godfather’s death and of the inheritance, Máximo gathered all of his strength and went into battle. He was wearing a fashionable jacket that day, a pair of pants tailored by an expert hand, he indulged in the luxury of a hairdresser, thinned the beginnings of an excessively thick mustache, amassed in his eyes all of the electricity in his body, and set off for Rua dos Arcos.

There are good reasons to believe that he didn’t lunch that day, apart from three or four cups of coffee. Coffee and cigarettes. Máximo smoked an unbelievable number of cigarettes. Tobacco sellers surely count on unhappy passions, waits for interviews, and other possibilities for which cigarettes are the obligatory confidant.",CO102CL08
1996,69,"Such, in short, was Máximo’s earlier life, and such was the cause of the gloom with which he was able to resist the joys of an unexpected inheritance—and twice unexpected, since he wasn’t counting on his godfather’s death and much less on his will.",CO102CL08

2018,91,"After “Sigh by Moonlight” came “Reverie,” a poem at once vaporous and delightful, as well as “Lap of Snow,” until Máximo announced some unpublished verses, composed just a few minutes before leaving home. Imagine! All ears were pricked in anticipation of this so very flavorful literary spice. And when he announced that the new poem was called “A Shanty and Your Love,” there was a broad murmur of admiration.

That calculated poem said that he, the poet, was poor, very poor, poorer than the birds in the sky, but that sheltering in it, by his beloved’s side, he would be the richest and most fortunate man in the world.

At tea, having recovered from the blow, and pricked mightily by resentment, he remembered to make the definitive move, which was to announce the inheritance. It was all so childish, so crazy, that his tongue twisted on him just in the thick of things, and the news didn’t escape his mouth.

Outside, he was sorry, he called himself a coward, a fool, a sissy, all of the ugly names a person of weak character will call himself when he comes up empty.

2116,10,"The city’s spectacle, which he hadn’t seen for a long time, always held his attention, a little. However, he didn’t have Ulysses’s enthusiasm within his soul when he saw his homeland. He had rather astonishment and boredom. He compared what he was seeing with what he had seen for many years and felt a painful longing tighten his heart more and more. He went to the first hotel that seemed convenient, as he was determined to spend a few days in the city before heading to Goiás.",CO040CL09
2117,11,"He had a sad and solitary dinner with his mind full of a thousand memories of the world he had just left. After finishing dinner, to have an even greater outpouring of memories, he stretched out on a settee and began to unravel inside himself a rosary of cruel misfortunes.",CO040CL09

2119,13,"Let’s look at some pathetic traces of our hero’s existence. He was born into a rich family, the son of a landowner from Goiás who had never known another land besides his own hometown. In 1828, they received the visit of a French naturalist, with whom Commander Seabra established an extremely friendly relationship, so much that he didn’t want to choose any other godfather for his only son, who was then one year old.",CO040CL09
2120,14,"Much before becoming a naturalist, the man had committed some poetic venalities which deserved some praise in 1810, but time, the old ragman of eternity, took the praise to the infinite depository of worthless things.",CO040CL09
2121,15,"The ex-poet forgave time for everything, except for the oblivion of a poem in which he had metrified the life of Furius Camillus,2 a poem which he still read with enthusiasm. He named his godson after the poet as a remembrance of the work of his youth, and the boy was christened by Father Maciel, to the great delight of friends and family.",CO040CL09
2122,16,"“My compadre,” the Commander said to the naturalist, “if this boy thrives, I shall send him to your land so that he learns Medicine or anything else that can turn him into a man. If he is to like minerals and plants, like you, don’t be ashamed: give him the fate you see fit, as if you were his own father, which you are, spiritually speaking.”",CO040CL09
2123,17,“Who knows if I’ll live that long?” the naturalist said.,CO040CL09
2124,18,"“Oh! You will!” Seabra protested. “Your body doesn’t lie; you have an iron temperament. Don’t I see you walking through the jungles and fields, heedless of sun and rain, without ever having the slightest headache? I would be dead with half of your work. You’ll live and take care of my boy. Just wait for him to complete his preparatory studies here.”",CO040CL09
2125,19,"Seabra’s promise was punctually fulfilled. Camillo went to Paris after some preparatory studies, and his godfather took care of him as if he really were his own father. The commander spared no money that his son might lack nothing. The allowance he sent could serve two or three people in the same circumstances. Besides the allowance, he also received, at Christmas and Easter, almonds and gifts from his mother, which arrived in his hands in the form of some excellent thousand francs.",CO040CL09
2126,20,"So far the only dark spot in Camillo’s existence was his godfather, who took too much care of him, since the boy might get lost in the abyss of the big city. However, good fortune wanted the ex-poet of 1810 to rest in limbo beside his extinct productions, leaving in science some serious traces of his passage. Camillo hurried to write a letter full of philosophical reflections to his father, some of them so deep that Father Maciel didn’t doubt he could honor them by inserting them in his next sermon.",CO040CL09
2127,21,The final part of the letter said the following:,CO040CL09
2128,22,"In conclusion, my father, if it seems to you that I have the necessary discernment to conclude my studies here, and if you trust in the good inspiration that has given me—the soul of the one who went away from this vale of tears to enjoy the infinite blessedness—let me stay here until I can return to my country as an enlightened man, able to serve it as is my duty. If your will is contrary to what I plead, tell me with sincerity, my father, because I will not stay a moment longer in this land, which has already become half a homeland for me, and nowadays (hélas!) is nothing but a land of exile.",CO040CL09
2129,23,"The good old man wasn’t smart enough to read between the lines of this weeping epistle the true feeling that dictated it. He wept with joy when he read his son’s words, showed the letter to all his friends, and hurried to answer the youngster that he could stay in Paris the time needed to conclude his studies, and that, besides the allowance, he would never deny anything that could be indispensable at unexpected circumstances.",CO040CL09
2130,24,"Besides, he wholeheartedly approved the feelings manifested in relation to his country and his godfather’s memory. He also sent many recommendations from Uncle Jorge, Father Maciel, Colonel Veiga, and all his friends and relatives, and concluded the letter with a blessing.",CO040CL09
2131,25,"Camillo received his father’s reply in the middle of a lunch he was throwing at Madrid Café for two or three first-class revelers. That answer was exactly what he expected, but he didn’t resist drinking in honor of his father’s health, an act in which he was accompanied by his elegant misdemeanants. On this same day Camillo planned some unexpected circumstances (for the commander), and the next mail brought to Brazil an extensive letter in which he thanked his father for his good expressions, telling him of his longing, entrusting him with his hopes, and asking him respectfully, in a post scriptum, the remittance of a small quantity of money.",CO040CL09
2132,26,"Thanks to these facilities our Camillo indulged himself in a free and expensive life, though not so much as to sacrifice his studies. His intelligence, as well as a certain self-esteem he didn’t lose, helped him greatly in this case. Having finished his studies, he was examined, approved, and handed a doctoral degree.",CO040CL09
2133,27,"The news of the event was transmitted to the father with a request to visit other lands of Europe. He obtained the permission and left Paris to visit Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and England. By the end of a few months he was at the great capital again, where he retied the thread of his old existence, now free of the strange and annoying care.",CO040CL09
2134,28,"The hopeful young man went through all the scales of frivolous and sensual pleasures with an eagerness that likened suicide. His friends were numerous, thoughtful, and constant. Some of them didn’t hesitate to turn him into a creditor. His name was truly popular among the young ladies from Corinth, many of whom loved him madly. There was no famous revelry in which his bedroom keys weren’t present. The same happened with races, feasts and walks, where cet aimable brésilien always occupied one of the first places.",CO040CL09
2135,29,"Wishing to see his son again, the commander wrote asking him to return to Brazil; but Camillo, Parisian to the marrow, wasn’t able to understand how a man could leave France and retire to Goiás. He answered evasively and remained there. The old man turned a blind eye to this first disobedience. Sometime later he insisted on calling him again, and he received new evasive answers from Camillo.",CO040CL09
2136,30,"The father got irritated, and the third letter he sent contained bitter reprimands. Camillo came to his senses and with great sorrow prepared himself to return to his homeland, without the hope of returning to Paris and ending his days on the Italian boulevard or by the door of Café Helder.",CO040CL09
2137,31,"One incident, however, once again delayed the return of the young doctor. Until then he had lived on easy loves and an hour’s passion, but he suddenly fell in love with a beautiful Russian princess. Don’t be afraid; people say that the Russian princess I’m talking about was a daughter from Bac Street who worked in a fashion house until the revolution of 1848.",CO040CL09
2138,32,"Amidst the popular thundering, a Polish major fell in love with her and took her to Warsaw, where she had just come from, having turned into a princess with a name ending in ine or off, I’m not quite sure. She lived mysteriously, mocking all her admirers except Camillo, for whom, according to her, she was willing to retire from her widowhood. However, as soon as she spoke those thoughtless expressions, she protested her eyes toward the sky:",CO040CL09
2139,33,"“Oh! No! Never, my dear Alexis, I would never dishonor your memory by marrying another man.”",CO040CL09
2140,34,"These were the daggers which lacerated Camillo’s heart. The young doctor swore by all the saints in the Greek and Latin calendar that he had never loved anyone the way he loved the beautiful princess. Sometimes the barbarous young lady seemed to be willing to believe in Camillo’s protests; sometimes, however, she shook her head and asked forgiveness to the shadow of the venerated Prince Alexis. Meanwhile a decisive letter from the commander arrived. For the last time, the old man from Goiás was summoning his son to come back home, under penalty of suspending his allowance and shutting the door to him.",CO040CL09
2141,35,"It wasn’t possible to tergiversate the return any longer. He even imagined a serious illness; but he feared his father could not believe it and would suspend his means, completely ruining the idea. Camillo didn’t even have the spirit to confess his position to the beautiful princess. He dreaded that she, with an outburst of generosity, natural in those who are in love, would want to share her lands in Novgorod with him. Accepting those would be a humiliation; refusing them would be an insult. Camillo preferred to leave Paris by writing her a letter in which he simply told her of the events and promised her he would be back someday.",CO040CL09
2142,36,"Such were the calamities with which fate wanted to defeat Camillo’s spirit. The unfortunate traveller reviewed all of them in his memory until he heard the clock striking eight at night. He left the hotel to breathe some fresh air. His longing for Paris was even more revived. Everything seemed to be lugubrious, limited and insignificant. With an Olympic disdain he looked at all the stores on Rua do Ouvidor, which seemed to him just like a very long and illuminated alley.",CO040CL09
2143,37,"He thought the men dowdy and the young ladies ungraceful. However, he remembered that Santa Luzia, his hometown, was even less Parisian than Rio de Janeiro, and so, feeling even more disheartened by this inopportune idea, he hurried to the hotel and went to sleep.",CO040CL09
2144,38,"The following day, soon after lunch, he went to his father’s correspondent’s house. He declared that he intended to head to Goiás in four or five days and received the necessary resources from him, according to the orders already given by the commander. The correspondent added that he was charged with facilitating anything Camillo wanted in case he wished to spend some days in the court.",CO040CL09
2145,39,"“No,” Camillo answered, “nothing attaches me to the court, and I’m eager to go.”",CO040CL09

2149,43,"Camillo was leaving when he saw a tall, slender man, with mustache and a little beard below the chin, coming in. He was wearing a brownish denim coat and a Chilean hat. The man looked at Camillo, stopped, stepped back, and after a reasonable hesitation said:",CO040CL09
2150,44,“I’m not wrong. You’re Mr. Camillo!”,CO040CL09

2156,50,"“I recognized you the moment I saw you, even though I think you’ve changed from what you were. Now you’re a refined youngster. I’m the old one. I’m already twenty-six… Don’t laugh: I’m old. When did you arrive?”",CO040CL09

2165,59,"Camillo indicated the hotel where he was lodged and said goodbye to his fellow countryman, satisfied to have found a companion who in some way could minimize the boredom of such a long trip.

2170,64,"As Soares began to recover the old friendship of the commander’s son, he started to talk about the memories of his life during the eight years of their separation and, in the absence of something better, this was what entertained Camillo on the occasions and in places where nature didn’t offer its own spectacle. After a journey of a few leagues, Camillo was informed of all Soares’s electoral strife, his hunting adventures, his love feats, and many other things, some of them serious, others futile, which were narrated by Soares with equal interest and enthusiasm.",CO040CL09
2171,65,"Camillo didn’t have the spirit of an observer, but Soares’s soul was being exposed so clearly that it was impossible not to see and examine it. He didn’t seem to be a bad young man. Camillo noticed, however, a certain swaggering attitude for all kinds of things: politics, hunting, gambling, and even love. In this last chapter there was a serious paragraph which was related to a young lady he loved madly, in such a way that he promised to annihilate whoever dared to look at her.",CO040CL09
2172,66,"“I tell you, Camillo,” the tradesman’s son confessed, “if someone dares to court this young lady, you can believe that there will be two disgraced men in this world: him and myself. Fortunately nothing like this will happen. Everybody there knows that I don’t blink to execute what I promise. Some months ago Major Valente lost the elections because he dared to say that he would arrange the resignation of the county judge. He didn’t do it, and as punishment he got what was coming to him. He disappeared from the list of substitutes. I was the one who pulled it off. The situation was….”",CO040CL09
2173,67,"“But why don’t you get married to this lady?” Camillo asked, cautiously deviating from the narration of Soares’s last electoral victory.",CO040CL09

2175,69,"“Curiosity… of a friend, and nothing more.”",CO040CL09

2179,73,“It’s a very long story. Isabel…”,CO040CL09

2186,80,“What was it?”,CO040CL09
2187,81,"“Look, Mr. Soares, (she said). You well deserve a young lady who accepts you as a husband. I would be capable of that, but I won’t because we would never be happy together.”",CO040CL09

What’s important to me is my conviction that she will never love anybody else, and that’s what everybody thinks.”",CO040CL09
2196,90,"“No wonder she doesn’t know how to love,” Camillo reflected, putting his eyes on the horizon as if the image of the famous czar’s vassal were there. “Not all women received this gift from heaven, which is truly a distinction of chosen spirits. Some women, however, know how to give their life and their souls to a beloved one, filling their hearts with deep love, and this way they live up to an endless adoration. There are few women of this caste, but they do exist…”",CO040CL09
2197,91,"Camillo ended the honors to the lady of his thoughts by opening the wings to a sigh, and he’s not to blame if it didn’t arrive at its destination.

2200,94,Camillo was sighing to himself. He would become even less communicative. But nothing was lost in his silence as his companion spoke enough for two.,CO040CL09

2202,96,"A drover took a guitar and began to trill a song, which would fascinate anybody else because of the rough simplicity of the verses and melody, except the commander’s son, who sadly began to remember the roulades of the Opera.15 The song reminded him of more; it reminded him of an evening in which the beautiful Muscovite princess sat softly in the box of the Italians.

2205,99,"Camillo was alone before the night, which was really beautiful and solemn. The perception of beauty wasn’t absent in the fellow from Goiás; and the almost novelty of that spectacle, which was forgotten due to a long absence, hadn’t stopped impressing him immensely.",CO040CL09
2206,100,"Sometimes distant howls from beasts wandering in loneliness came to his ears. It also happened sometimes with the sad, nearby birdcalls of some nocturnal birds. The crickets and also the frogs formed the chorus of the hinterland opera, which our hero certainly admired, but he undoubtedly preferred the comic opera instead.",CO040CL09
2207,101,"He remained this way for a long time, for about two hours, letting his spirit wander at the mercy of longing, building and taking apart a thousand castles in the air. He suddenly came back to himself at the sound of Soares’s voice. He seemed to be the victim of a nightmare. He sharpened his ears and heard the loose and muffled words murmured by his companion:",CO040CL09
2208,102,“Isabel… dear Isabel…What’s this? Oh! My God! Help!”,CO040CL09
2209,103,"The last syllables were more afflicted than the first ones. Camillo ran to his companion and shook him strongly. Soares woke up dazed, sat up, looked around him and murmured:",CO040CL09
2210,104,“What?”,CO040CL09
2211,105,“A nightmare.”,CO040CL09
2212,106,"“Yes, it was a nightmare. Thank God! What time is it?”",CO040CL09
2213,107,“It’s still night.”,CO040CL09
2214,108,“Are you already awake?”,CO040CL09
2215,109,"“I’m going to bed now. Let’s go to sleep, it’s about time.”",CO040CL09
2216,110,“Tomorrow I’ll tell you the dream.”,CO040CL09
2217,111,"Next day, effectively, soon after the first twenty paces, Soares told the terrible dream he’d had the night before.",CO040CL09
2218,112,"“I was at the bank of a river,” he said, “with a rifle in my hand, spying the capybaras. I casually look to the bank on the opposite side, which was a lot higher, and I see a young lady riding a black horse, in a black dress, and with the hair, which was also black, falling on her shoulders…”",CO040CL09
2219,113,“It was all darkness…” Camillo interrupted.,CO040CL09
2220,114,"“Wait; I was amazed to see there, that way, a lady who seemed to be so thin and delicate. Who do you think it was?”",CO040CL09
2221,115,“Isabel.”,CO040CL09
2222,116,"“Isabel. I ran along the bank, climbed up on a stone that was in front of the place where she was, and I asked her what she was doing there. She was silent for a while. Then she pointed to the bottom of the big cave and said:",CO040CL09
2223,117,‘My hat fell down there.’,CO040CL09
2224,118,‘Ah!’,CO040CL09
2225,119,"‘Do you love me, Sir?’ she said after a few minutes.",CO040CL09
2226,120,‘More than life!’,CO040CL09
2227,121,‘Would you do everything I ask?’,CO040CL09
2228,122,‘Everything’,CO040CL09
2229,123,"‘Well, go and get my hat.’",CO040CL09
2230,124,"“I looked down. It was a huge cave, with muddy and thick water seething and roaring at the bottom. Instead of going down with the torrent until it was completely lost, the hat was stuck at the top of a rock, and it seemed to invite me to go down to the bottom. But it was impossible. I looked everywhere, to see if I could find a way. There was none…”",CO040CL09
2231,125,"“See what fervent imagination is!” Camillo said, cutting him short.",CO040CL09
2232,126,“I was looking for some words to dissuade Isabel from her horrible idea when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around. It was a man… it was you.”,CO040CL09
2233,127,“Me?”,CO040CL09
2234,128,"“It’s true. You looked at me with derision, smiled to her and then looked into the abyss. Suddenly, I cannot say how, you were down below, stretching out your hands to grab the fateful little hat.”",CO040CL09
2235,129,“Ah!”,CO040CL09
2236,130,"“The water, however, was suddenly thickening and threatening to submerge you. So Isabel, letting out an anguished scream, spurred the horse and threw herself down the bank. I screamed…",CO040CL09
2237,131,I asked for help; everything was useless. The water was already wrapping both of you in its folds… when I was woken by you.”,CO040CL09
2238,132,"Leandro Soares concluded the narration of his nightmare, seeming to be still frightened by what happened to him… imaginatively. It is worth saying that he believed dreams.",CO040CL09
2239,133,"“See what bad digestion is!” Camillo observed when his fellow countryman concluded the story. “What a series of silliness! The hat, the bank, the big cave, and more than everything, my presence in this fantastic melodrama—all this is the work of a poorly digested dinner. In Paris, there are theaters that represent such nightmares, which are worse than yours because they’re longer. But what I can see is that this young lady doesn’t leave you even when you’re sleeping.”",CO040CL09
2240,134,“Not even when I’m sleeping!”,CO040CL09
2241,135,"Soares said these words unconsciously, almost like an echo. Since he’d concluded the narration, and soon after Camillo’s words, he began to reflect on some things within himself, reflections which aren’t known to the author of this narrative. All I can tell you is that these reflections weren’t cheerful, because his brow dropped and his forehead wrinkled, and he, staring at the animal’s ears, retired to an inviolable silence.",CO040CL09
2242,136,"From that moment on, the trip was less bearable for Camillo than it had been. Besides a light melancholy that had taken hold of his friend, the riding of many leagues was becoming so bothersome that it didn’t seem to have an end.",CO040CL09
2243,137,"Soares finally returned to his habitual verbosity, but by then nothing could beat the deadly boredom that had taken power of the miserable Camillo.",CO040CL09
2244,138,"However, when he caught sight of the city, which was near the farm where he experienced the dawn of his youth, Camillo felt his heart throbbing. A serious feeling dominated him. For a while, at least, the Parisian splendors gave way to the small and honest homeland of the Seabras.",CO040CL09
2245,139,III,CO040CL09
2246,140,The Meeting,CO040CL09
2247,141,"It was a really festive day when the commander embraced the son whom he had sent to foreign lands eight years before. The old man couldn’t control his tears; he couldn’t, because they came from a heart which was still lush with affections and exuberant with tenderness.",CO040CL09
2248,142,"Camillo’s happiness was no less intense and sincere. He kissed his father’s hands and forehead repeatedly, hugged his relatives, his old friends, the eight-years acquaintances, and for a few days—not many—he seemed to be completely cured of his desire to return to Europe.",CO040CL09
2249,143,No other subject was more discussed in town and all its surroundings. The commander’s son was not the main but the exclusive subject of all the conversations and commentaries. Nobody was tired of praising him. His manners and elegance were admired by everyone. The same superiority he used to talk to everybody found sincere enthusiasts.,CO040CL09
2250,144,"For many days, it was impossible for the young man to think about anything other than telling his friends and loved ones about his trips. But anything boring was tolerated by everybody, because any little thing he said was indefinably graceful to the eyes of the others.",CO040CL09
2251,145,"Nobody hesitated to praise him face to face. The ones who didn’t do that went straight to his father, who would tell them everything full of pride. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2252,146,"Father Maciel, who had baptized him twenty-seven years before and saw in him a grown-up man, was the first town crier of his transformation.",CO040CL09
2253,147,"“You can be proud, Mr. Commander,” he said to Camillo’s father. “You can be proud that heaven gave you a first-rate fellow. If I’m not deceived by the affection I hold for the young man who only yesterday was a child, Santa Luzia will have a first-class doctor! And not only a doctor, but a philosopher; it’s true, he seems to be a good philosopher. Yesterday I observed him in this regard, and I found no weakness or doubt in him.",CO040CL09
2254,148,Uncle Jorge was asking everybody’s opinions about his nephew Camillo. Lieutenant Colonel Veiga thanked divine providence for Dr. Camillo’s arrival near the Holy Spirit festivities.,CO040CL09
2255,149,“My festival ball would be incomplete without him.”,CO040CL09
2256,150,"Dr. Mattos wasn’t the last one who visited the commander’s son. He was a tall and well-built man, even though he was a bit broken by the years.",CO040CL09
2257,151,"His political orientations were opposed to the commander’s, which didn’t prevent them from being intimate friends, something they had proved to each other on more than one occasion. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2258,152,"“Come, doctor,” said the old Seabra as he saw Dr. Mattos emerging from the door. “Come and see my man.”",CO040CL09
2259,153,"“He’s a man indeed,” Mattos answered, looking at the youngster. “He’s more of a man than I supposed. But eight years have gone by! Come on, give me a hug!”",CO040CL09
2260,154,"The youngster opened his arms to hug the old man. Then, as he usually did with everybody who visited him, he told him some things about his trips and his studies. It’s perfectly useless to say that our hero always omitted everything that could shake the good concept that was in everybody’s mind. To give him credit, he said he lived almost like an anchorite, and nobody dared think differently.",CO040CL09
2261,155,"So everything was cheerful in the good city and its surroundings. The young doctor, flattered by the unexpected welcome he’d had, continued not to think too much about Paris.",CO040CL09
2262,156,"But time flies, and it modifies our sensations. By the end of fifteen days Camillo had worn out all the novelty of his impressions. The farm began to change its appearance. The fields became monotonous, the trees became monotonous, the rivers became monotonous, the city became monotonous, and also he himself became monotonous. Then, something we can call “nostalgia of exile” invaded him.",CO040CL09
2263,157,"“No,” he said to himself, “I can’t stay here for two more months. Paris or the cemetery, this is the dilemma I’m offered. In two months I’ll be dead or in Europe.”",CO040CL09
2264,158,"Camillo’s boredom didn’t escape his father’s attention, as he always kept his eyes on him.",CO040CL09
2265,159,"“He’s right,” the commander thought. “Those who have lived in those beautiful, cheerful lands, as everybody says, can’t be happy here. I need to give him something to occupy himself… politics, for example.”",CO040CL09
2266,160,"“Politics!” Camillo exclaimed, when his father mentioned this subject. “What good does politics do me, my father?”",CO040CL09
2267,161,"“Many things. It offers a way into positions. You’ll be a provincial deputy first; then you can go to the Chamber of Deputies in Rio de Janeiro. One day you will demand an explanation from the ministry, and if he falls, you may climb to the government. Have you never had the ambition to be a minister?”",CO040CL09
2268,162,“Never.”,CO040CL09
2269,163,“It’s a pity.”,CO040CL09
2270,164,“Why?”,CO040CL09
2271,165,“Because it’s good to be a minister.”,CO040CL09
2272,166,"“To govern men, right?” Camillo said laughing. “It’s an ungovernable sex; I prefer the other.”",CO040CL09
2273,167,"Seabra laughed at his son’s outburst, but he didn’t lose the hope of convincing his heir.",CO040CL09
2274,168,The doctor had been in his father’s house for twenty days when he remembered the story told by Soares and the dream he’d had in the inn.,CO040CL09
2275,169,"The first time he went to town and met the dealer’s son, he asked him:",CO040CL09
2276,170,"“Tell me, how is your Isabel doing? I still haven’t seen her.”",CO040CL09
2277,171,"Soares looked at him, frowning his eyebrows. He shrugged, dryly growling:",CO040CL09
2278,172,“I don’t know.”,CO040CL09
2279,173,Camillo didn’t insist.,CO040CL09
2280,174,"“The disease is still in its acute period,” he said to himself.",CO040CL09
2281,175,"However, he was curious to see the charming Isabelinha, who had brought that gabby campaigner down to earth. The young doctor had already talked to all the young ladies in the area, ten leagues around him. Isabel was the only one who had eluded him until that moment. Eluded isn’t the right word. Camillo had been to Dr. Mattos’s farm once, but his daughter was ill. At least that was what people told him.",CO040CL09
2282,176,"“Don’t worry,” a neighbor told him when he showed his impatience to meet Leandro Soares’s beloved. “You will see her at the ball Colonel Veiga is going to throw, or at the Holy Spirit festivities, or on any other occasion.”",CO040CL09
2283,177,"The lady’s beauty, which he didn’t believe could be superior or even similar to that of Prince Alexis’s widow, and Soares’s incurable passion, and the secrecy with which Soares talked about Isabel—all that excited the commander’s son’s curiosity to the utmost.",CO040CL09
2284,178,"The following Sunday, eight days before the Holy Spirit, Camillo left the farm to go to Mass at the city’s church, as he had already done on previous Sundays. The horse was going at a slow pace, the pace of the thoughts of its rider, who wandered lazily around the countryside in search of sensations that he no longer had and did not expect he could have again.",CO040CL09
2285,179,"A thousand singular ideas crossed Camillo’s mind. He longed to fly, horse and all, to tear through the air and fall in front of Palais-Royal or anywhere else in the capital of the world. Soon after that he was making up a cataclysm that would take him to have lunch at Café Tortoni two minutes after Father Maciel occupied the pulpit.",CO040CL09
2286,180,"Nobody knows how far a vagrant and burning imagination can reach. Camillo’s imagination created many similar marvels, using them to abbreviate his path. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2287,181,"Suddenly, around a bend in the road, some distance away, he spotted two ladies on horseback, followed by a servant. He spurred his horse, and in no time was beside the three riders. One of the ladies turned her head, smiled, and stopped. Camillo approached, bareheaded, stretching his hand out to her for her to shake.",CO040CL09
2288,182,"The lady he was greeting was Lieutenant Colonel Veiga’s wife. She seemed to be forty-five years old but well preserved. The other lady, when she saw her companion’s movement, also made her horse stop and she, too, turned her head. Camillo wasn’t looking at her at that moment. He was busy in listening to D. Gertrudes, who gave him news about the lieutenant colonel.",CO040CL09
2289,183,"“Now he’s only thinking about the festivities,” she said. “He may be in the church already. You are going to Mass, aren’t you?”",CO040CL09
2290,184,“Yes.”,CO040CL09
2291,185,“Let’s go together.”,CO040CL09
2292,186,"Having exchanged these words, which were very quick, he looked around for the other rider. She, however, was already going a few steps ahead of them. The doctor came up beside of D. Gertrudes, and the entourage continued to ride.",CO040CL09
2293,187,They had been talking for about ten minutes when the horse of the lady ahead of them stopped. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>,CO040CL09
2294,188,"“What happened, Isabel?” D. Gertrudes asked.",CO040CL09
2295,189,"“Isabel!” Camillo exclaimed, without paying attention to the incident that provoked the question of the lieutenant colonel’s wife.",CO040CL09
2296,190,"The young lady turned her head and shrugged, dryly answering:",CO040CL09
2297,191,“I don’t know.”,CO040CL09
2298,192,"The cause was a rustle the horse sensed behind a thicket of bamboo on the left of the trail. However, before the servant or Camillo went to look into the cause of the animal’s reluctance, the young lady made a supreme effort and, whipping the horse vigorously, stimulated it to overcome its fear, and she started to gallop ahead of her companions.",CO040CL09
2299,193,“Isabel!” said Camillo to D. Gertrudes. “Isn’t she Dr. Mattos’s daughter?”,CO040CL09
2300,194,“Yes. Didn’t you recognize her?”,CO040CL09
2301,195,“It’s been eight years since I last saw her. She’s a flower! No wonder people talk so much about her beauty. They told me she was ill…”,CO040CL09
2302,196,"“She was, but her illnesses are minor things. They have a nervous cause, or at least this is what we say when we don’t know why a person is suffering…”",CO040CL09
2303,197,"Isabel stopped at a distance, and, turning to the left of the road, she seemed to admire the spectacle of nature. Some minutes later her companions were next to her. The young lady was going to continue the ride, when D. Gertrudes said:",CO040CL09
2304,198,“Isabel!”,CO040CL09
2305,199,The young lady turned her face to the woman. D. Gertrudes came closer to her.,CO040CL09
2306,200,“Don’t you remember Dr. Camillo Seabra?”,CO040CL09
2307,201,"“Perhaps she doesn’t,” Camillo said. “She was twelve when I left, and eight years have gone by.”",CO040CL09
2308,202,"“I do remember,” she answered, bending her head softly, but without looking at the doctor.",CO040CL09
2309,203,"And, whipping the horse gently, she moved ahead. No matter how singular it was to reestablish an old friendship that way, what really impressed the commander’s son was Isabel’s beauty, which seemed to live up to its reputation.",CO040CL09
2310,204,"As far as one could judge at first sight, the slender rider had to be more tall than short. She was dark-haired, but in a silky and soft way, with shades of pink beneath the skin, which could be the result of her moving around, as people often said she was extremely pale.",CO040CL09
2311,205,"Even though Camillo couldn’t see her eyes, he felt the light coming from them, and that was perhaps worth more than if she had looked straight at him. He soon understood that those were the eyes with which the beautiful goiana had fascinated the miserable Soares.",CO040CL09
2312,206,"He didn’t, and couldn’t, make out her other facial features, but what he could contemplate at ease and was already admiring from a distance was the natural elegance of the torso and the gracious audacity with which she was riding the horse.",CO040CL09
2313,207,"He had already seen many elegant and skilled horsewomen, but this one in particular had some advantages over the others. Maybe it was the dishevelment of the gestures or the spontaneity of the movements, or something else perhaps, or all of them together, which gave the beautiful goiana an incontestable supremacy.",CO040CL09
2314,208,"Isabel stopped the horse from time to time and spoke to the lieutenant colonel’s wife about any little incidents, or plays of sunlight, a bird passing by, a sound they heard, but at no point did she look directly, or even askance, at the commander’s son.",CO040CL09
2315,209,"Absorbed in his contemplation of the young lady, Camillo stopped talking, and for some time he and D. Gertrudes rode side by side without saying a word. They were interrupted in their silent ride by a horseman who was approaching the entourage at a fast trot.",CO040CL09
2316,210,It was Soares.,CO040CL09
2317,211,"The tradesman’s son was very different from the previous days. He greeted them, smiling joyfully as he had on his first days of the trip with the doctor. It wasn’t difficult to notice, however, that Soares’s joy was fake. The poor guy scowled from time to time, or made a gesture of despair which fortunately escaped the others’ attention.",CO040CL09
2318,212,"But nothing escapes an author’s attention when the intention is to educate his readers. I could introduce you to a young man who was a little happy, a little sad, without being clear about the reasons for his melancholy. No, sir; I prefer to tell you that Isabel’s suitor was pretending a happiness he didn’t have in order to better hide the rage that was devouring him. Why rage? He loved the young lady passionately, and his love was so modest and complacent that he was happy at seeing her from a distance. He even forgave her lack of interest under the condition that she would never love another man. Well, jealousy was tenaciously biting the poor lover’s heart, a jealousy with no positive cause, a jealousy from instinct and premonition. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2319,213,"Soares feared the triumph of a man who was materially and physically superior to him; and who, besides that, enjoyed the great advantage of dominating public attention, a man who was the bear of the village, the event of the day, the man of the hour. Everything conspired to overthrow Soares’s last hope, the hope of seeing the young lady dying free of any marital bond. The unfortunate lover had the common bad habit of wanting to see the glass broken if he couldn’t bring it to his own lips.",CO040CL09
2320,214,"His fear, however, increased when, having hidden in the bamboo thicket I mentioned before, seeing Isabel pass by, as he so often did, he found out that Camillo was in the entourage. He couldn’t control an exclamation of surprise, and he even took a step toward the road. He controlled himself in time.",CO040CL09
2321,215,"The riders, as we have seen, passed on, leaving the zealous suitor swearing to heavens and earth that he would take revenge on his bold rival, if he was one.",CO040CL09
2322,216,"As we well know, Camillo wasn’t a rival. His heart was still fresh with the memory of the Russian Artemis,19 whose tears, despite distance, the youngster felt were ardent and afflictive. But who could convince Leandro Soares that the elegant “young man from Europe,” as people called him, couldn’t fall in love with the elusive goiana?",CO040CL09
2323,217,"Just seeing the unhappy suitor, however, Isabel stopped her horse and affectionately held out her hand. A lovely smile accompanied this gesture. It wasn’t enough to dissipate the poor young man’s doubts. But Camillo’s impression was a different one.",CO040CL09
2324,218,"“She loves him, or she’s a big sneak,” he thought.",CO040CL09
2325,219,"Casually, and for the first time, Isabel looked at the commander’s son. By perspicacity or divination, she read this hidden thought in his face. Her forehead furrowed softly with an expression so evident that the doctor was perplexed and couldn’t stop adding, then with his lips, saying to himself in a low voice:",CO040CL09
2326,220,“Or she talks to the devil.”,CO040CL09
2327,221,"“Perhaps,” the young lady murmured, her eyes fixed on the ground.",CO040CL09
2328,222,"This was said without the other two noticing, and without them addressing each other. Camillo, partly scared, partly curious, couldn’t take his eyes off the beautiful Isabel after the word she whispered under such singular conditions. Soares looked at Camillo with the same tenderness with which a hawk stalks a dove. Isabel played with the horsewhip. D. Gertrudes, who feared missing Father Maciel’s Mass and receiving a friendly reprimand from her husband, ordered everybody to get going, and the entourage moved on immediately.",CO040CL09

2330,224,The Party,CO040CL09
2331,225,The following Saturday the city put on a different appearance. A crowd of people rushed from the neighboring villages to attend the annual Holy Spirit festivities.,CO040CL09
2332,226,"There are few places where the taste for these traditional festivities, remnants from other eras, hasn’t faded away. Writers from the future century will eagerly study them in order to paint for their contemporaries a picture of a country that they no longer see.",CO040CL09
2333,227,"Not many years ago this court witnessed a very popular Holy Spirit festival at the old church of Santa Anna. Next to it there was a platform where the emperor of the Divine, who was a child, and its stock keeper, who was also a child, spent the whole afternoon and evening during the days of the festivities. The platform was called empire. A band played harmonious songs to which the populace listened for free, because the festival happened in a time when these spectacles were free. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2334,228,"Fireworks were fired off at night. The pyrotechnist wasn’t spared, or was hardly spared, severe criticism from the most joyous part of the assembly. Families, some on chairs, others on mats, according to their respective possessions, spent the night in the old field of Santa Anna. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2335,229,"Sometimes a more serious incident disturbed one spot or another, and the historical soil of the field received a little blood splattered from the nose and even the head of a less-than-prudent bystander. But the police put an end to the situation, inviting the interrupters to reflect, in a less wide-open place, about the advantage of not disturbing the public peace. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2336,230,"The immortal Telles was a great figure in these historical festivities. He was an immortal in the memory of the present generation and presented various spectacles in his classic tent. People competed en masse; students played pranks; love affairs began, weddings started up… All this has ended. Rio de Janeiro is now civilized and has learned new ways of having fun. The old traditions are being extinguished from Brazilian customs.",CO040CL09
2337,231,"At the time when this story takes place, one of the most genuine Holy Spirit celebrations happened in the city of Santa Luzia.",CO040CL09
2338,232,"Lieutenant Colonel Veiga, who was the emperor of the Divine, was in a house he owned in the city.",CO040CL09
2339,233,"A group of shepherds, composed of men and women, went there on Saturday evening with their picturesque attire, followed by the classic old man, a fellow wearing trunks and socks, shallow shoes, slender dress-coat, long waistcoat, and a big walking stick in his hand.",CO040CL09
2340,234,"Camillo was at the colonel’s house when the bunch of shepherds appeared with some musicians in front of the house, and many people behind them. They formed a circle on the street. Two shepherds, a man and a woman began the classical dance. They all danced, sang and played at the door and in the colonel’s living room. He was delighted. It’s a doubtful point, and it will probably never be settled, whether Lieutenant Colonel Veiga preferred to be a minister of State or the emperor of the Divine on that occasion.",CO040CL09
2341,235,"However, that was just a taste of the lieutenant colonel’s magnitude. The Sunday sun must have illuminated bigger things. This reason seemed to have determined that the king of light bring his best rays that day. The sky had never shown itself so clearly blue. During the night some thick clouds wilted the revelers’ hopes. Fortunately, a strong wind blew, swept the sky, and purified the atmosphere.",CO040CL09
2342,236,"The population responded to nature’s thoughtfulness. Early on people appeared in their Sunday best: joyous, smiling, chattering, nothing less than happy.",CO040CL09
2343,237,The air thundered with fireworks. The bells joyfully invited people to the religious ceremony.,CO040CL09
2344,238,"Camillo spent the night in town at Father Maciel’s house and woke up, earlier than expected, with the fireworks and the demonstrations of the happy city. He continued to have the same Parisian habits at his father’s house, and the commander thought he shouldn’t disturb him. He usually woke up at 10 or 11 in the morning, except on Sundays, when he went to Mass in order not to fully offend the habits of the place.",CO040CL09
2345,239,"“What the hell is this, Father?” Camillo shouted from the bedroom where he was at the moment when a pinwheel opened his eyes definitely.",CO040CL09
2346,240,"“What could it be?” Father Maciel answered, putting his head through the door. “It’s the festivity.”",CO040CL09
2347,241,“So the festivities start at night?”,CO040CL09
2348,242,“At night?” the priest exclaimed. “It’s daylight.”,CO040CL09
2349,243,"Camillo couldn’t sleep anymore and was forced to wake up. He had lunch with the priest, told him two anecdotes, confessed to the host that Paris was the ideal of all cities, and went out in order to go to the emperor of the Divine’s house. The priest went with him. On their way, they saw Leandro Soares from a distance.",CO040CL09
2350,244,"“Won’t you tell me, Father,” Camillo asked, “why Dr. Mattos’s daughter doesn’t care about that poor young man who loves her so much?”",CO040CL09
2351,245,Maciel arranged his glasses and exposed the following reflection:,CO040CL09
2352,246,“You seem to be a fool.”,CO040CL09
2353,247,"“Not so much as you think,” the commander’s son replied, “because more than one person has asked the same question.”",CO040CL09
2354,248,"“That’s what it is,” the priest said, “but there are things that others say and we don’t repeat. Isabelinha doesn’t like Soares simply because she doesn’t.”",CO040CL09
2355,249,“Don’t you think this young lady is a little bit strange?”,CO040CL09
2356,250,"“No,” the priest said, “she’s very crafty.”",CO040CL09
2357,251,“Ah! Why?”,CO040CL09
2358,252,"“I suspect she is very ambitious, and she doesn’t accept Soares’s love because she is waiting for a marriage that will open the doors to political greatness for her.”",CO040CL09
2359,253,"“Well,” Camillo said, shrugging.",CO040CL09
2360,254,“Don’t you believe it?”,CO040CL09
2361,255,“No.”,CO040CL09
2362,256,“I may be wrong; but I believe I’m right. Everybody around here has an explanation for Isabel’s exemption. All of them seem absurd to me. I believe mine is the best.”,CO040CL09
2363,257,Father Maciel showed he belonged to our human family. His conjecture was better and truer for the sole reason of its being his. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>,CO040CL09
2364,258,Camillo made some objections to the priest’s explanation and took leave to go to the lieutenant colonel’s house.,CO040CL09
2365,259,"The joyous emperor was literally beside himself. It was the first time he had occupied an honorific position, and he wanted to do it brilliantly, even better than his predecessors. The natural desire not to be outdone was accompanied by the element of political envy. A few adversaries were saying through the grapevine that the proud colonel wasn’t able to handle all that.",CO040CL09
2366,260,"“They will see that I’m able to handle this,” was the answer he gave when some concerned friends told him about the wickedness of his opponents.",CO040CL09
2367,261,"When Camillo entered the room, the lieutenant colonel was finishing giving some orders for the dinner that would take place after the festivities. Camillo heard some information given by a defining brother about a ceremony of the sacristy.",CO040CL09
2368,262,"“I dare not talk to you, colonel,” said the commander’s son, when Veiga was alone with him. “I dare not interrupt you.”",CO040CL09
2369,263,"“You don’t interrupt me,” the emperor of the Divine said. “By now everything must be finished. Is the commander coming?”",CO040CL09
2370,264,“He must be here already.”,CO040CL09
2371,265,“Have you already seen the church?”,CO040CL09
2372,266,“Not yet.”,CO040CL09
2373,267,"“It’s very beautiful. I’m not bragging about myself. I believe that the party won’t be less worthy than the others, and it will be even better in some aspects.”",CO040CL09
2374,268,"It was absolutely impossible not to agree with this opinion when it was expressed by the one who was interested in praising himself. Camillo’s presence increased the festivities’ worthiness even more. The colonel listened to him with a smile of intimate satisfaction and was willing to prove that his young friend hadn’t yet appreciated the situation well, when he turned the conversation by asking:",CO040CL09
2375,269,“Hasn’t Dr. Mattos already arrived?”,CO040CL09
2376,270,“He has.”,CO040CL09
2377,271,“With his family?”,CO040CL09
2378,272,"“Yes, with his family.”",CO040CL09
2379,273,At this point they were interrupted by the sound of a lot of fireworks and a song which was approaching.,CO040CL09
2380,274,“They’re here!” Veiga said. “They’re coming to get me. You have to excuse me.”,CO040CL09
2381,275,"Until that moment, the colonel had been wearing black pants and a denim frock coat. He ran to get himself ready with the costume and the insignias of his elevated position. Camillo went to the window to see the procession. Before long the procession appeared. It was made up of a band of the brotherhood of the Holy Spirit and the shepherds of the previous day.",CO040CL09
2382,276,"The brothers wore scarlet mantles and marched with heavy steps, surrounded by people, who were filling the street and gathering by the lieutenant colonel’s door to see him leave.",CO040CL09
2383,277,"When the procession stopped in the front of the lieutenant colonel’s house, the music stopped playing and all eyes turned curiously to the windows to see if they saw him. But the novice emperor wasn’t ready yet, and the curious people had to make do with Dr. Camillo.",CO040CL09
2384,278,"However, four or six senior brothers stood out from the group and went up the lieutenant colonel’s stairs.",CO040CL09
2385,279,"Minutes later Camillo greeted the senior brothers, one of whom was more senior than the others, not only in his position but also, and above all, in his size. And Major Brás’s height would be his most notable aspect if he weren’t so thin.",CO040CL09
2386,280,"The major’s mantle was also notable in its genre because it wasn’t going down the curve of the leg like the other mantles, nor was it at his waist, as it should be if it were made with the same measure. It was a medium mantle. It was between his waist and the curve, and it was done this way in order to reconcile the major’s height with the principles of elegance.",CO040CL09
2387,281,All the senior brothers reached out to the commander’s son and eagerly asked for the lieutenant colonel.,CO040CL09
2388,282,"“He won’t be long. He’s getting ready for the celebrations,” Camillo answered.",CO040CL09
2389,283,"“The church is full,” one of the senior brothers said. “Only the emperor is missing.”",CO040CL09
2390,284,"“It’s fair to wait for him,” Major Brás said.",CO040CL09
2391,285,"“That’s true,” the brothers said.",CO040CL09
2392,286,"“Moreover,” said the immense official, “we have time and we aren’t going far.”",CO040CL09
2393,287,"The other brothers supported the major’s opinion with a gesture, which soon started to tell Camillo about the thousand problems the celebrations had given him and all the other gentlemen who participated in the event, and no less than the lieutenant colonel.",CO040CL09
2394,288,"“As a reward for our feeble efforts” (Camillo made a negative gesture to these words from Major Brás), “we’re aware that the thing won’t be a bad one.”",CO040CL09
2395,289,These words hadn’t quite left the worthy official’s lips when the lieutenant colonel appeared at the door in all the splendor of his transformation.,CO040CL09
2396,290,Camillo had entirely lost the notions he’d had of the outfit and the badges worn by an emperor of the Divine. This is why he was astonished when he saw the figure of the lieutenant colonel appearing at the door.,CO040CL09
2397,291,"Besides the black pants he was already wearing when Camillo arrived, the lieutenant colonel wore a coat which, considering the regularity and elegance of the cut, could easily compete with the ones worn by the most refined members of the Cassino Fluminense. So far so good.",CO040CL09
2398,292,"A commendation from the Order of the Rose, which didn’t look bad on him, shined on his chest. But what exceeded all expectations, and painted Camillo’s face with the most complete expression of astonishment, was a beautiful, brilliant, showy cardboard crown lined with gold paper which the lieutenant colonel had on his head.",CO040CL09
2399,293,"Camillo stepped back and stared at the lieutenant colonel’s imperial insignia. He couldn’t remember the existence of that indispensable accessory on those occasions. Having lived eight years in the middle of a diverse civilization, he didn’t imagine that such customs still existed, customs he believed buried.",CO040CL09
2400,294,The lieutenant colonel shook the hands with all the friends and declared he was ready to accompany them.,CO040CL09
2401,295,"“Let’s not leave the crowd waiting,” he said.",CO040CL09
2402,296,"They immediately took to the street. There was a movement of curiosity among the crowd when people saw the scarlet mantle of one of the brothers who had gone up appear at the door. Another mantle appeared close behind it, and soon the remaining mantles appeared, flanking the exuberant emperor.",CO040CL09
2403,297,"The golden crown, just as the sun hit its plate, began to give off almost improbable sparkles. The lieutenant colonel looked from side to side, inclined his head gently to some people in the crowd, and occupied his place of honor in the procession. The music soon broke into a march performed by the lieutenant colonel, the brotherhood and the shepherds in the direction of the church.",CO040CL09
2404,298,"When the people in the church caught sight of the procession, the bell-ringer, who was already waiting, put in action the most complicated lessons learned in his job, while a pinwheel, interspersed with some loose fireworks, announced to the clouds in heaven that the emperor of the Divine had arrived.",CO040CL09
2405,299,"There was a general stir in the church as the announcement was made. An active and skillful master of ceremonies was opening the way, with great difficulty, because the people, eager to see the lieutenant colonel’s form, had gathered disorderly, undoing his efforts.",CO040CL09
2406,300,"In the end, what happened always happens on these occasions. The pathways opened up, and the emperor passed through the crowd, albeit with difficulty, preceded and accompanied by the brotherhood, and he arrived at the throne which rose beside the altar.",CO040CL09
2407,301,"He went up the steps of the throne stair steadily, and sat down, as proud as if from there he ruled all the empires of the world. By the time Camillo arrived at the church, the celebrations had already begun. He found a tolerable place, or rather entirely good place, because it allowed him to appreciate a group of young ladies, and among them he found the beautiful Isabel.",CO040CL09
2408,302,Camillo was eager to talk to Isabel again. The meeting on the road and the singular perspicacity she demonstrated on that occasion hadn’t left his mind.,CO040CL09
2409,303,"The young lady seemed not to pay attention to him, but Camillo was so skillful in dealing with the fair sex that it wasn’t hard for him to notice that she had seen him and intentionally didn’t turn her eyes toward him.This circumstance, linked to the incidents from the previous Sunday, gave rise to the following question in his spirit:",CO040CL09
2410,304,“What does she have against me?”,CO040CL09
2411,305,"After the gospel was sung, Father Maciel rose to the pulpit, where, as usual, he preached the sermon. Father Maciel had the talent of giving a new sermon every year without adding or taking anything away from the first sermon he had preached. He just changed the prayers and phrases. Sometimes he added one more adverb or conjunction. The rest was both the same and also something else. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2412,306,"For some years now the sermon had suffered a minor reform. He added some new phrases that, as the readers will remember, belonged to the letter that Camillo sent his father when his godfather died. As the priest perhaps had forgotten said circumstance, he didn’t change this part of the sermon, and already here the reader can imagine Camillo’s surprise when he heard, in public, a number of philosophical sentences that he immediately recognized, as they were the product of a few hours of deep meditation. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2413,307,"The celebration continued without any novelty. Camillo didn’t take his eyes off his beautiful charade, a name he had given her, but the charade seemed to be refractory to all sense of curiosity.",CO040CL09
2414,308,"Once, however, toward the end, Camillo’s and Isabel’s eyes met. Truth be told, the young man surprised the young lady looking at him. He greeted her and was reciprocated, nothing more.",CO040CL09
2415,309,"When the celebration finished, the brotherhood led the lieutenant colonel to his house. In the midst of the hustle and bustle of leaving, Camillo, who was absorbed in looking at Isabel, heard an unknown voice whispering to his ear:",CO040CL09
2416,310,“Watch what you’re doing!”,CO040CL09
2417,311,"Camillo turned and faced a short, thin man with lively little eyes, poor but neatly dressed. They looked at each other for a few seconds without saying a word. Camillo didn’t know that face and didn’t dare ask for an explanation about the words he had heard, even though he was burning inside to know the rest.",CO040CL09
2418,312,"“There’s a mystery,” said the unknown man. “Would you like to find it out?”",CO040CL09
2419,313,They were silent for some time.,CO040CL09
2420,314,"“This isn’t a proper place,” Camillo said, “but if you have something to tell me…”",CO040CL09
2421,315,“No; find out for yourself.”,CO040CL09
2422,316,"After saying this, the short, thin man with the lively little eyes, disappeared in the midst of the crowd. Camillo elbowed ten or twelve people, stepped on fifteen or twenty toes, asked forgiveness for his recklessness so many times until he found himself in the street seeing nobody resembling the unknown man.",CO040CL09
2423,317,“A soap opera!” he said. “I’m in the middle of a soap opera.”,CO040CL09
2424,318,Isabel was leaving the church with D. Gertrudes and Dr. Baptista. Camillo approached the group and greeted them. Baptista gave his arm to D. Gertrudes. Camillo shyly offered his arm to Isabel.,CO040CL09
2425,319,"The young lady hesitated, but it wasn’t possible to refuse. She slipped her arm around the young doctor’s, and the group went to the house where the lieutenant colonel and some more important people from the area had already gathered.",CO040CL09
2426,320,In the middle of the crowd there was a man who was also going to the colonel’s house and who couldn’t take his eyes off Camillo and Isabel. This man was biting his lips until they bled. Is it necessary to say that the man was Leandro Soares?,CO040CL09
2427,321,V,CO040CL09
2428,322,Passion,CO040CL09
2429,323,"The distance between the church and the house was short, and the conversation between Camillo and Isabel was neither long nor flowing. And yet, reader, if the Muscovite princess deserves some of your sympathy, you should sincerely pity her.",CO040CL09
2430,324,"The dawn of a new feeling began to gild the ridges of Camillo’s heart. As he was going up the stairs, the commander’s son confessed to himself that the interesting patrician had qualities that were superior to the ones possessed by the beautiful Russian princess. An hour and a half later, toward the end of dinner, Camillo’s heart fully confirmed this discovery of his investigative spirit.",CO040CL09
2431,325,"The conversation, however, was just about totally meaningless things, though Isabel spoke with distinction and grace, without changing her habitual reservation. Her eyes were so beautiful when seen up close, as well as her hair, mouth and hands, that our ardent young man could resist the influx of so much grace only if he entirely changed his temperament.",CO040CL09
2432,326,"Dinner continued without any appreciable novelty. All the notables of the place were gathered at the lieutenant colonel’s table—government officials, the vicar, the county judge, the tradesman, the farmer, with a great cordiality reigning on all sides of the table.",CO040CL09
2433,327,"The emperor of the Divine, restituted to his ordinary clothes, did the honors of the table with great enthusiasm. The celebration was the main topic of the general conversation, interspersed, of course, with political reflections, with which everybody agreed since all of them, ladies and gentlemen, belonged to the same party.",CO040CL09
2434,328,"There they decided that their absent adversaries were the most inept, corrupt and unpopular individuals that existed from the Amazon to the La Plata. The harshness of such opinion was compensated by the idea that the adversaries, in similar meetings, had already said the same, and were inclined to repeat it as soon as news from Rio de Janeiro announced that public opinion had abandoned the current rulers. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09
2435,329,"Major Brás had the habit of making one or two long and eloquent toasts at each dinner of a certain club he attended. The ease with which he expressed himself was unrivaled in the many thousand square leagues that composed the surface of the province. Besides that, as he was endowed with enormous stature, he dominated the auditorium in such a way that the simple act of standing up was considered half a triumph.",CO040CL09
2436,330,"The major couldn’t leave the lieutenant colonel’s dinner unscathed. Dessert was about to be served when the eloquent major asked permission to say some sincere and simple words. A murmur like that of the minority members in the legislation welcomed the orator’s declaration, and the audience prepared their ears to receive the pearls that were going to fall from his mouth.",CO040CL09
2437,331,"“O illustrious auditors who are listening to me,” he said, “will forgive my audacity; it isn’t talent which is speaking, gentlemen, it’s my heart. My toast is short. It’s not necessary to make a long speech to celebrate the illustrious Lieutenant Colonel Veiga’s virtues and capacities. His name says it all; my voice would be worthless…”",CO040CL09
2438,332,"The audience showed, with signs, that they applauded the first member of this last phrase without reservation, and the second with reservation, that is; they saluted the lieutenant colonel and the major. The orator, who had to be coherent with what he had just said, had to limit himself to emptying his glass and continuing as follows:",CO040CL09

Many Holy Spirit festivities have taken place in this city and in others, but the people have never had the jubilation of contemplating such splendor, animation, triumph as the one provided by our illustrious co-religionist and friend, the Lieutenant Colonel Veiga who honors the class to which he belongs, and the glory of the party which he joined…”",CO040CL09

2441,335,"“We couldn’t expect anything different from you, Your Excellency,” the orator said, changing his voice to give these words a parenthetical tone. Despite the declaration made in the beginning, that it was useless to add anything to the lieutenant colonel’s merits, the intrepid orator spoke for some twenty five minutes, to the great sorrow of Father Maciel, who was flirting with a trembling and fluffy bread pudding from a distance; and the county judge, who was anxious to smoke. The peroration of this memorable speech was more or less like this:",CO040CL09
2442,336,"“I would fail, therefore, in my duties as a friend, a co-religionist, a subordinate and an admirer, if I didn’t raise my voice on such an occasion, and if I didn’t tell you in a truly coarse but sincere language, (signs of disapproval), the feelings that disturb my heart, the enthusiasm that possesses me, when I contemplate the venerated and illustrious Lieutenant Colonel Veiga, and if I didn’t invite you to drink with me to the health of His Excellency.”",CO040CL09

Leandro Soares, who had been invited to dinner and attended it, didn’t take his eyes off his elegant rival and his beautiful and elusive lady.",CO040CL09
2447,341,"The reader might consider the lack of concern and even the joyful air with which Soares saw his adversary’s attacks as a miracle. It’s not a miracle Soares also interrogated Isabel’s look and read disinterest in it, and perhaps the disdain with which she treated the commander’s son.",CO040CL09
2448,342,"“Neither I nor him,” the suitor said to himself.",CO040CL09
2449,343,"Camillo was in love. He was worse the following day. The fire which consumed him was increasing with each passing day. Paris and the princess, everything had disappeared from the young man’s heart and memory. Only one person, only one place deserved his attentions now: Isabel and Goiás.",CO040CL09

2455,349,"Camillo, however, visited Dr. Mattos’s farm and had dinner there a few times. It was difficult to talk to Isabel with the freedom that more modern customs allow, but he did what he could to communicate his feelings to the beautiful young lady. Isabel seemed to be even more aloof to the youngster’s communications. Her manners weren’t positively contemptuous, but they were cold. It had been said that inside her chest lived a heart of snow.",CO040CL09

No, sir; it’s a really ugly parasite, a corpse of a flower, dry and weedy, a flower that might have been gorgeous a long time ago, on the stalk, but that today, in the little basket in which it lies, doesn’t inspire any feelings except curiosity.",CO040CL09

2470,364,“Catch!” he said from above.,CO040CL09
2471,365,"Isabel approached the tree and caught the flower in her lap. Happy for having satisfied the girl’s desire, the boy climbed down the tree but did it so disastrously that at the end of two minutes, he was lying on the ground at Isabel’s feet.",CO040CL09
2472,366,"The girl let loose a scream of anguish and asked for help. The boy tried to reassure her that nothing had really happened and tried to get up joyfully. He stood right up, with his shirt bloodstained. He’d hurt his head.",CO040CL09
2473,367,The wound was declared to be light. The valiant boy completely recovered in a few days. Isabel received a really deep impression on that occasion.,CO040CL09
2474,368,"She had liked the boy until that moment, but thereafter she began to worship him. The flower he picked for her naturally dried out. Isabel kept it as if it were a relic. She kissed it every day, and from a certain time onward she even cried over it. A kind of superstitious worship held the young lady’s heart to that withered parasite.",CO040CL09
2475,369,"There, reader, is the object of Isabel’s love. However, her heart wasn’t so bad that she wasn’t vividly impressed when she learned of Camillo’s illness. She urged people to keep asking about the young man’s condition. And five days later she went with her father to visit him at the commander’s farm.",CO040CL09
2476,370,"It was possible that the young lady’s simple visit would cure the patient, but as the disease was epidemic, Isabel’s visit only comforted the young man and gave him some encouragement. It had yet another effect: some hopes came to him, hopes that were already drier and more withered than the parasite whose story I narrated above.",CO040CL09
2477,371,"“Who knows if she will not love me now?” he thought. As soon as he recovered, his first move was to go to Dr. Mattos’s farm. The commander wanted to go with him.",CO040CL09
2478,372,"Dr. Mattos wasn’t at home. They found only his sister and his daughter. His sister was a poor old lady who, besides this ailment, had two others: she was deaf and liked politics.",CO040CL09
2479,373,"The event was good. While Isabel’s aunt confiscated the commander’s presence and attention, Camillo had the time necessary to strike a fast and decisive blow, directing the following words to the young lady:",CO040CL09
2480,374,“I would like to thank you for the kindness you showed me during my illness. This same kindness encourages me to ask you one more thing…”,CO040CL09
2481,375,Isabel frowned.,CO040CL09
2482,376,"“My hope was revived some days ago,” Camillo continued, “a hope that was already dead. Would it be an illusion on my part? A word or a gesture from you will remove this doubt.”",CO040CL09
2483,377,Isabel shrugged.,CO040CL09
2484,378,"“I don’t understand,” she said.",CO040CL09
2485,379,"“You do,” Camillo said in a bitter tone. “But I’ll be more direct if you require. I love you. I’ve told you a thousand times, and I haven’t been noticed. Now, however…”",CO040CL09
2486,380,"Camillo would have willingly concluded this short speech if he had, in front of him, the person he wished could hear it. Isabel, however, didn’t give him time get to the end. Without saying a word or making a gesture, she crossed the wide porch and sat down at the other end where her old aunt put to the test the commander’s excellent lungs.",CO040CL09
2487,381,"Camillo’s disappointment was beyond all description. Feigning to suffer from a heat which wasn’t there, he left to get some fresh air. Rushing or dragging as irritation or dismay triumphed inside him, the miserable suitor let himself wander around aimlessly.",CO040CL09
2488,382,"He built a thousand plans for revenge, devised a thousand ways to go throw himself at the young lady’s feet, recalled all the facts in which she was involved, and by the end of one long hour he reached the sad conclusion that all was lost.",CO040CL09
2489,383,"At that moment he came back to himself. He was at the foot of a stream that ran through Dr. Mattos’s farm. The place was rough and singularly suitable for the situation he found himself in. Some two hundred steps ahead he saw a hut, where it seemed that someone was singing a song from the backlands.",CO040CL09
2490,384,Someone else’s happiness is annoying when we are the victims of some misfortune. Camillo felt even more annoyed and naively asked himself if anybody could be happy when his heart was bleeding with despair.,CO040CL09
2491,385,Some seconds later a man appeared at the hut’s door and went directly to the stream. Camillo trembled. He seemed to recognize the mysterious man who had talked to him on the day of the Holy Spirit. He had the same height and the same air. He approached quickly and stopped five feet away. The man turned his face. It was him! Camillo ran to the stranger.,CO040CL09
2492,386,“Finally!” he said.,CO040CL09
2493,387,The stranger smiled complacently and shook the hand that Camillo offered him.,CO040CL09
2494,388,“Do you want to rest?” he asked.,CO040CL09
2495,389,"“No,” the doctor answered. “Right here, or further along if you prefer, but right now, please, I wish you explain to me the words you told me the other day in the church.”",CO040CL09
2496,390,The stranger smiled again.,CO040CL09
2497,391,"“So?” Camillo said, seeing that the man didn’t answer.",CO040CL09
2498,392,"“First of all, tell me: do you truly like the young lady?”",CO040CL09
2499,393,“Oh! A lot!”,CO040CL09
2500,394,“Do you swear you will make her happy?”,CO040CL09
2501,395,“I swear!”,CO040CL09
2502,396,"“So listen. What I’m going to tell you, sir, is true, because I’ve learned from my wife, who was Isabel’s mucama.22 That’s her, over there.”",CO040CL09
2503,397,"Camillo looked at the door of the hut and saw a tall, elegant young mulatta, who was looking at him with curiosity.",CO040CL09
2504,398,"“Now,” the stranger continued, “move away a bit, so that she doesn’t hear us, because I don’t want her to know where you heard this story.”",CO040CL09
2505,399,"They went a good distance farther away, following the river. The stranger told Camillo the whole story of the parasite and the worship that the young lady still devoted to the dry flower. A less sagacious reader can imagine that the young lover was sad and dispirited with this story. But the reader who knows how to read will soon guess that the stranger’s confidence awoke the most incredible startling happiness in Camillo’s soul.",CO040CL09
2506,400,"“There you have it,” the stranger said to conclude, “I believe now you may know where you’re walking, sir.”",CO040CL09
2507,401,“Oh! Yes! Yes!” Camillo said. “I’m loved! I’m loved!”,CO040CL09
2508,402,"Knowing this information, the doctor was eager to go back to the house he had left a long time ago. He put his hand in his pocket, opened the wallet and took out a twenty thousand réis note.",CO040CL09
2509,403,"“The service you just provided to me is immense,” he said. “it’s priceless. This, however, is just a token…”",CO040CL09
2510,404,"With these words, he held out the note. The stranger laughed scornfully without a word. Then he reached to take the note Camillo offered him, and to the young man’s great awe, he threw it in the stream. The trickle which was murmuring and bouncing over the rocks took the note and wrapped it in a leaf which had also been taken by the wind.",CO040CL09
2511,405,"“Thus,” the stranger said, “you neither owe me any favors nor do I get paid for it. Don’t think that I had the intention of serving you, sir. No. My desire is to make my benefactor’s daughter happy. I knew she liked a boy, and that he was able to make her happy. I opened the way for him to get where she is. You can’t pay for that. You can only express your gratitude.”",CO040CL09
2512,406,"With those words, the stranger turned his back to the doctor and went to his hut.",CO040CL09
2513,407,"Camillo followed the rustic man with his eyes. Soon after he was at Isabel’s house, where people were anxiously waiting for him. Isabel saw him come in happy and radiant.",CO040CL09
2514,408,"“I know everything,” Camillo told her before leaving.",CO040CL09
2515,409,The young lady looked astonished at him.,CO040CL09
2516,410,“Everything?” she repeated.,CO040CL09
2517,411,"“I know you love me, I know that this love was born many years ago, when you were a child, and that still now…”",CO040CL09
2518,412,"He was interrupted by the commander, who was approaching. Isabel was pale and confused. She appreciated the interruption, because she wouldn’t know what to answer.",CO040CL09
2519,413,"The following day Camillo wrote her a long and passionate letter, invoking the love that she had kept alive in her heart, and asking her to make him happy. Camillo waited two days for the young lady’s answer. It came on the third day. It was brief and dry. She confessed she had loved him for a long time, and that she had sworn never to love another man.",CO040CL09
2520,414,"“This is it.” Isabel concluded. “As for being your wife, never. I wanted to give my life to someone who had a love like mine. Your love was born yesterday; mine is eight years old; the age difference is too great; this can’t be a good deal. Forget me and farewell.”",CO040CL09
2521,415,To say that this letter did no more than increase Camillo’s love is to write on paper what the reader has already guessed. Camillo’s heart just hoped for the young lady’s written confession to transpose the limit that separated him from madness. The letter disturbed him completely.,CO040CL09

2523,417,Events Rush Headlong,CO040CL09
2524,418,The commander hadn’t lost the idea of involving his son in politics. There would be an election that same year. The commander wrote to the main influential men of the province so that the young man could enter the respective Assembly.,CO040CL09
2525,419,"Camillo had news of his father’s premeditations. He limited himself to a shrug, having decided not to accept anything else but Isabel’s hand. In vain his father, Father Maciel, the lieutenant colonel showed him a splendid future, a future sowed with high positions. Only one position contented him: to marry the young lady.",CO040CL09
2526,420,It surely wasn’t easy. Isabel’s resolution seemed unshakable.,CO040CL09
2527,421,"“She loves me, however,” the youngster would tell himself, “that’s half the battle.”",CO040CL09
2528,422,"And as his love was more recent than hers, Camillo understood that the way to overcome the age difference was to show that his love was more violent and capable of greatest sacrifices.",CO040CL09
2529,423,"He didn’t spare any kind manifestation. Rain and storms he braved to go see her every day. He became a slave to her smallest desires. If Isabel had the childish curiosity to see the morning star in her hands, it’s very likely that he would find a way to bring it to her. At the same time, he stopped pestering her with letters or loving words. The last words he said were:",CO040CL09
2530,424,“I’ll wait!”,CO040CL09
2531,425,"He was in this hope for many weeks, and it didn’t improve substantially.",CO040CL09
2532,426,"A less demanding reader will find Isabel’s resolution singular, even after learning she was loved. I also think so, but I don’t want to change the heroine’s character, because she’s exactly the way I’m presenting her in these pages. She understood that being loved casually, only because the young man had returned from Paris, while she spent long years remembering him and living exclusively from his memories, she understood, I say, that this humiliated her and, and because she was immensely proud, she decided not to marry him or another man. It’s absurd, but it was so.",CO040CL09
2533,427,"Tired of needlessly harassing the young lady’s heart, and on the other hand, convinced that it was necessary to show one of those invincible passions to persuade her and break her resolution, Camillo planned to pull off a great coup.",CO040CL09
2534,428,"One morning he disappeared from the farm. At first nobody was disturbed by the youngster’s absence, as he was accustomed to taking long walks, especially when he woke up earlier than usual. The situation, however, began to scare everybody as time passed. Emissaries went to all parts and returned without any news of the young man.",CO040CL09
2535,429,His father was desperate. The news spread everywhere for ten leagues around.,CO040CL09
2536,430,"By the end of two days of useless search, it became known that a young man with all the characteristics of Camillo had been seen half a league from the city, on horseback, traveling to the countryside. He was lonely and sad. Later a drover asserted he saw a man near a ravine, seeming to evaluate, with his eyes, the probability of death a fall could bring him.",CO040CL09
2537,431,"The commander began to offer heavy amounts of money to whoever could give certain news of his son. All his friends sent people to investigate the woods and fields, and a week was spent in this useless toil.",CO040CL09
2538,432,Would it be necessary to talk about the pain beautiful Isabel suffered when she received the news of Camillo’s disappearance? The first impression was apparently nil. Her face didn’t reveal the storm that had immediately broken out in her heart. Ten minutes later the storm rose to her eyes and overflowed into a veritable sea of tears.,CO040CL09
2539,433,"It was then that her father became aware of the passion that had been incubating for so long. Seeing that explosion, he didn’t doubt his daughter’s love might prove to be fatal to her. His first thought was that the young man had disappeared to escape an marriage he couldn’t get out of. Isabel reassured him, saying that, on the contrary, it was she who had refused to accept Camillo’s love.",CO040CL09
2540,434,“It was I who killed him!” the poor young lady exclaimed.,CO040CL09
2541,435,"The good old man couldn’t understand the reason why a young lady in love with a young man, and a young man in love with a young lady, rather than moving into marriage, tried to move away from each other. He remembered that his behavior was exactly the opposite soon after his first date.",CO040CL09
2542,436,"He hastened to inform the commander of the probable cause of Camillo’s disappearance, but both pooled their efforts to recover the young fugitive. <TRANSLATION ADDED OR DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",CO040CL09

2545,439,“Saved!” father and daughter exclaimed.,CO040CL09
2546,440,"“It’s true,” Miguel said (for that was the man’s name); “I found him at the bottom of a ravine, almost lifeless, yesterday afternoon.”",CO040CL09
2547,441,“And why didn’t you come and tell us?...” the old man asked.,CO040CL09
2548,442,"“Because I needed to take care of him first. When he came around he wanted to attempt against his life again. I and my wife prevented him from doing so. He’s a bit weak, that’s why he didn’t come with me.”",CO040CL09
2549,443,"Isabel’s face was radiant. Some tears, few and silent, still ran from her eyes, but they were tears of happiness and not of sorrow.",CO040CL09
2550,444,Miguel left with the promise that the old man would go get the commander’s son.,CO040CL09
2551,445,"“Now, Isabel,” the father said, as soon he was alone with her. “What do you intend to do?”",CO040CL09
2552,446,"“Whatever you order me to do, my father!”",CO040CL09
2553,447,“I’ll just order what your heart says. What does it tell you?”,CO040CL09
2554,448,“It says…”,CO040CL09
2555,449,“What?”,CO040CL09
2556,450,“It says yes.”,CO040CL09
2557,451,"“This is what it should have said a long time ago, because…”",CO040CL09
2558,452,"“It’s what I should have said long ago, because...” The old man stopped.",CO040CL09
2559,453,“But what if the cause of the suicide is something else?” he thought. “I’ll find out.”,CO040CL09
2560,454,"He communicated the news to the commander, and it didn’t take long for him to appear at Dr. Mattos’s house, where Camillo arrived soon after. Written on the face of the miserable young man was the pain of having escaped the tragic death he had sought. At least he said so many times on the way to Isabel’s father.",CO040CL09
2561,455,“But what was the cause of such a resolution?” the doctor asked him.,CO040CL09
2562,456,"“The cause...” Camillo murmured, concentrating on the question, “I dare not confess it…”",CO040CL09
2563,457,“Is it shameful?” the old man asked with a benevolent smile.,CO040CL09
2564,458,“Oh! No!”,CO040CL09
2565,459,“But what cause is it?”,CO040CL09
2566,460,"“Forgive me, if I tell you?”",CO040CL09
2567,461,“Why not?”,CO040CL09
2568,462,"“No, I dare not…” Camillo said resolutely.",CO040CL09
2569,463,"“It’s useless, because I already know.”",CO040CL09
2570,464,“Ah!”,CO040CL09
2571,465,“And forgive the cause; but don’t forgive her decision; you make it childish.”,CO040CL09
2572,466,“But she despises me!”,CO040CL09
2573,467,“No… she loves you!”,CO040CL09
2574,468,"Here Camillo perfectly imitated a gesture of surprise and followed the old man into the house, where he met his father, who didn’t know whether he should look severe or satisfied toward his son.",CO040CL09
2575,469,"As soon as he entered, Camillo realized the effect this disaster had caused in Isabel’s heart.",CO040CL09
2576,470,"“Well!” said the young lady’s father. “Now that we’ve resurrected him, it’s necessary to hold him to life with a strong chain.”",CO040CL09
2577,471,"And without waiting for the usual formality or attending normal social etiquette, Isabel’s father gave the commander the news that marrying their children was indispensable.",CO040CL09
2578,472,"The commander still hadn’t come around from the surprise of having found his son when he heard the news, and he wouldn’t feel the same thing if the whole Xavantes23 tribe had fallen over him armed with bows and arrows. He looked alternately to all the bystanders as if asking the reason behind a natural fact.",CO040CL09
2579,473,"Finally, they explained Camillo’s and Isabel’s passion, sole cause of the suicide half-executed by his son. The commander approved the young man’s choice and proved his gallantry by saying that he would have done the same if he couldn’t count on the young lady’s will.",CO040CL09
2580,474,“Will I finally be worthy of your love?” the doctor asked Isabel when he found himself alone with her.,CO040CL09
2581,475,"“Oh! Yes!” she said. “If you died, I would never forgive myself this disgrace, whose cause was me alone!”",CO040CL09
2582,476,Camillo hurried to say that Providence watched over him; and no one ever knew what it was that he called Providence. It didn’t take long for the outcome of the tragic episode to be spread around the city and its surroundings.,CO040CL09
2583,477,"As soon as Leandro Soares heard that Camillo and Isabel were planning to get married he was literally beside himself. A thousand plots came to his mind, each bloodier than the next. In his opinion they were two perfidious people who had cheated him. It was necessary to take solemn revenge on both.",CO040CL09
2584,478,"No tyrant ever dreamt more terrible tortures than those Leandro Soares engendered in his scalded imagination. The poor fellow spent two days and two nights in sterile conjectures. On the third day he decided to simply look for the fortunate rival, throw his villainy in his face and afterward murder him.",CO040CL09
2585,479,He armed himself with a knife and left.,CO040CL09
2586,480,"The happy groom was leaving the farm, heedless of the fate that awaited him. His imagination ideated a life full of blessedness and heavenly delights. The young lady’s image gave everything around him a poetic color. He was engulfed in these dreams when he saw his unsuccessful rival. In the middle of his happiness he had forgotten him. He realized he was in danger and prepared for it.",CO040CL09
2587,481,"Faithful to the program he imposed on himself, Leandro Soares unraveled a rosary of offenses, which the doctor heard in silence. When Soares finished and was going to put into practice the bloody end, Camillo replied:",CO040CL09
2588,482,"“I paid attention to everything you said; now I ask you to listen to me. It’s true I’m going to marry this young lady, but it’s also true that she doesn’t love you. What is our crime in this case? Now, while you, sir, nourish feelings of hatred toward me, I was thinking of your happiness.”",CO040CL09
2589,483,“Ah!” Soares said ironically.,CO040CL09
2590,484,"“It’s true. I said to myself that a man with your qualities shouldn’t be eternally dedicated to be a stepping stone to others. And so, as my father wants to force me to be a provincial deputy, I told him I would accept the position and pass it over to you, sir. My father agreed, but I had to overcome political resistance, and still now I’m trying to break some of them down. I believe such a man deserves some esteem – at least, he doesn’t deserve so much hatred.”",CO040CL09
2591,485,"I don’t believe human language has words strong enough to paint the indignation that showed in Leandro Soares’s face. The blood rushed to it while fire seemed to spark from his eyes. His lips trembled as if quietly rehearsing an eloquent impression against his happy rival. At last, the unhappy suitor broke forth:",CO040CL09
2592,486,"“The action you took, sir, was already quite infamous. You didn’t need to add mockery to it…”",CO040CL09
2593,487,“Mockery!” Camillo interrupted.,CO040CL09
2594,488,"“What other name will I give to what you have just said? High esteem, really, is yours. Having stolen from me the greatest—the only—happiness I could have, you offer me a political compensation!”",CO040CL09
2595,489,"Camillo managed to explain that he wasn’t offering any compensations. He thought about the idea because he knew Soares’s political tendencies, and he thought the idea would be agreeable.",CO040CL09
2596,490,"“At the same time,” the skillful groom concluded, “I have been led by the idea of providing a service for the province. You can believe that in no case, even if it were to cost my life, would I propose something disadvantageous for the province and the country. I intended to serve both by presenting your candidacy, and you can believe that my opinion will be the same as everyone else’s.”",CO040CL09
2597,491,"“But you talked about resistance…” Soares said, as he fixed an inquisitorial look on his adversary.",CO040CL09
2598,492,"“Resistance, not for personal opposition, but for political conveniences,” Camillo explained. “What is it worth? Everything is undone by reasoning and the true principles of the party that has the honor of having you among its members.”",CO040CL09
2599,493,"Leandro Soares didn’t take his eyes off Camillo. A wry smile full of threats hung on his lips. He beheld him for some more minutes without saying a word, until he broke the silence again.",CO040CL09
2600,494,"“What would you do in my place?” he asked, giving his wry smile a truly murky air.",CO040CL09
2601,495,"“I would refuse,” Camillo answered boldly.",CO040CL09
2602,496,“Ah!”,CO040CL09
2603,497,"“Yes, I would refuse it, because I have no political vocation. That doesn’t apply to you, sir, you who have such an avocation, and are, because of that, supported by the party throughout the county.”",CO040CL09
2604,498,"“I have this conviction,” Soares said, proudly.",CO040CL09
2605,499,“You’re not the only one; everybody does you justice.”,CO040CL09
2606,500,"Soares started to pace back and forth. Evidently some sinister plans fluttered in his mind. Or was humanity demanding moderation in the type of death he would give the rival? Five minutes went by. At the end of them, Soares stopped in front of Camillo and asked him abruptly:",CO040CL09
2607,501,“Can you swear to me something?”,CO040CL09
2608,502,“What?”,CO040CL09
2609,503,“That you’ll make her happy.”,CO040CL09
2610,504,“I already swore to myself; it’s my sweetest duty.”,CO040CL09

2612,506,"“Believe that I know how to evaluate your big heart,” Camillo said, holding out his hand to him.",CO040CL09
2613,507,"“Perhaps. What you don’t understand, what you don’t know, is the storm that remains in my soul, the immense pain which will follow me until I die. Such love follows you to the grave.”",CO040CL09
2614,508,"He stopped, shook his head as if to expel a sinister idea.",CO040CL09
2615,509,"Seeing Soares’s gesture, Camillo asked, “What are your thoughts?”",CO040CL09
2616,510,"“Don’t worry,” he said, “I don’t have any plans. I’ll resign myself to fate. And if I accept the political candidacy you offer me, it is only to drown the pain that smothers my heart.”",CO040CL09
2617,511,"I don’t know if this electoral remedy will work for all the cases of the love disease. In Soares’s heart it produced a salutary crisis, which was resolved in favor of the patient.",CO040CL09
2618,512,"The readers will soon divine that Camillo hadn’t said anything in favor of Soares; but he soon strived in that direction, as did his father, and at last he managed to have Leandro Soares included on an election ticket and presented to the voters in the next campaign. The young man’s adversaries, cognizant of the circumstances in which the candidacy was offered to him, didn’t fail to say, in all tones, that he sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.",CO040CL09
2619,513,"The commander’s son had been married for one year when a French traveler appeared on his farm. He carried some letters of recommendation from one of his Parisian teachers. Camillo welcomed him cheerfully and asked for news of France, a country he still loved, he said, as his intellectual homeland. The traveler told him many things, and finally pulled out a bundle of newspapers from his bag.",CO040CL09
2620,514,It was Le Figaro.,CO040CL09
2621,515,"“Le Figaro!” Camillo exclaimed, binding himself to the newspapers.",CO040CL09
2622,516,"They were late but they were Parisian. They reminded him of the life he’d had for many years, and even if he felt no desire to exchange it for his current life, a certain curiosity awakened memories from another time. In the fourth or fifth edition he opened he came across a news item which made him read with amazement. It said:",CO040CL09
2623,517,"The celebrated Leontina Caveau, who claimed to be the widow of one Prince Alexis, subject of the Tsar, was taken to prison yesterday. The beautiful lady (beautiful she was!), not content with deceiving some gullible youngsters, absconded with all the jewelry that belonged to her neighbor, Mlle. B… The robbery victim reported it in time, so it was possible to prevent the escape of the sly lady.",CO040CL09
2624,518,Camillo had just read this news item for the fourth time when Isabel entered the room.,CO040CL09

2629,3,RETURN TO BRAZIL,CO040CL10
2630,4,"ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, Senhor Camilo Seabra disembarked in Rio de Janeiro on his return from Europe. Born in the province of Goiás, he had gone to Europe to study medicine and was returning with his degree in his pocket and a deep sense of longing in his heart.",CO040CL10
2631,5,"He had been away for eight years, and had seen and admired all the major things that a man can see and admire over there, always assuming he lacks neither taste nor means. He lacked for neither, and if he had possessed, I won’t say a lot, but at least a little more common sense, he would have enjoyed the experience far more than he did, and could then, with some justification, have said that he had truly lived.",CO040CL10
2632,6,"As he crossed the bar into Brazil’s capital city, his face betrayed little patriotic feeling. He looked withdrawn and melancholy, like someone holding back an emotion that was not exactly one of earthly bliss. He cast a jaundiced eye over the city gradually unfolding before him as the ship approached its anchorage.",CO040CL10
2633,7,"When the moment came to disembark, he did so about as blithely as would a prisoner when entering the prison gates. As the skiff moved away from the ship, on whose mast fluttered the French tricolor, Camilo murmured:",CO040CL10
2634,8,"“Farewell, France!”",CO040CL10
2635,9,Then he wrapped himself in a magnificent silence and allowed himself to be rowed ashore.,CO040CL10
2636,10,"After such a long absence, the sight of the city did manage to hold his attention a little. However, unlike Ulysses, his soul did not thrill to see his homeland again, but was filled, rather, with dullness and tedium. He was comparing what lay before him with what he had seen during those long years away, and his heart was gripped by an all-pervading sense of loss. He found the nearest convenient hotel and decided to stay for a few days before continuing his journey to Goiás.",CO040CL10
2637,11,"He dined in sad solitude, his mind full of a thousand recollections of the world he had just left, and, after dinner, in order to give his memory free rein, he lay down on the sofa in his room and began to count off, like beads on a rosary, the many cruel misfortunes that had befallen him.",CO040CL10
2638,12,"In his opinion, no mortal had ever been so sorely abused by a hostile fate. The whole of Christian martyrology, all the Greek tragedies, and the Book of Job paled into insignificance beside his own misfortunes.",CO040CL10
2639,13,"Let us review some of the cruel facts of our hero’s life. He had been born rich, the son of Comendador Seabra, a landowner in Goiás, who had never himself left his native province. In 1828, a French naturalist had visited Goiás, and become such firm friends with the comendador that the latter chose him and him alone as godfather to his only son, who, at the time, was just one year old.",CO040CL10
2640,14,"The naturalist, long before he became a naturalist, had committed a few venal poetic sins that had garnered him a certain amount of praise in 1810, but time—the old rag-and-bone man of eternity—had carried them off to the infinite dumping ground of all worthless things.",CO040CL10
2641,15,"The ex-poet forgave time everything except the consignment to oblivion of a poem in which he had celebrated in verse the life of the Roman soldier and statesman Marcus Furius Camillus, a poem he still read with genuine enthusiasm. As a souvenir of that youthful work, he named his godson Camilo, and, to the great delight of family and friends, Father Maciel baptized him with that name.",CO040CL10
2642,16,"“My friend,” said Comendador Seabra to the naturalist, “if my boy reaches maturity, I will send him to your country to study medicine or some other subject that will make a man of him. If, like you, my friend, he should reveal a talent for the study of plants or minerals, then don’t hesitate to let him follow whichever profession you think best suits him, just as if you were his father, which, spiritually speaking, you are.”",CO040CL10
2643,17,“Who knows if I will still be alive then?” said the naturalist.,CO040CL10
2644,18,"“Of course you will!” cried Seabra. “That body of yours doesn’t lie. You possess an iron constitution. Why, I’ve seen you out and about in fields and forests, day after day, come rain or shine, and never even suffer so much as a slight headache. If I did half as much as you, I’d have been dead long ago. You must live and take care of my boy, as soon as he’s finished his studies here.”",CO040CL10
2645,19,"Seabra kept his promise to the letter. Camilo left for Paris as soon as he had completed his preparatory exams, and there his godfather looked after him as if he really were his father. The comendador made sure his son lacked for nothing, for the monthly allowance he sent him would have been enough for two or three people in his position. As well as the allowance, he received traditional Easter and Christmas gifts from his mother, which reached him in the welcome form of a few thousand francs.",CO040CL10
2646,20,"So far the only black cloud in Camilo’s existence was his godfather, who kept an all-too-keen eye on him, fearful that the boy might topple over the edge of one of the many precipices that await the unwary in any large city. Fate, however, decided that the ex-poet of 1810 should join his defunct artistic creations in the great void, leaving just a few traces in science of his passage through life. Camilo immediately wrote his father a letter full of philosophical reflections.",CO040CL10
2647,21,The concluding paragraph read as follows:,CO040CL10
2648,22,"In short, Father, if you feel confident that I have the necessary good sense to complete my studies here, and are prepared to trust in the inspiration I will draw from the soul of he who has now exchanged this vale of tears for infinite bliss, then allow me to remain here until I can return to my country as an enlightened citizen ready to serve his nation, as is my duty. Should you be opposed to my suggestion, then please say so frankly, and I will stay not a moment longer in this place, which has been half a homeland to me and which now (hélas!) is merely a place of exile.",CO040CL10
2649,23,"His father was not a man capable of looking beneath the surface of this tearful epistle to see its real intention. He wept with joy when he read his son’s words, showed the letter to all his friends, and wrote at once to tell his son that he could stay in Paris as long as necessary to finish his studies, and that, in addition to his monthly allowance, he would always help him out should any unforeseen difficulty arise.",CO040CL10
2650,24,"Moreover, he wholeheartedly approved of his son’s sentiments regarding his own country and his godfather’s memory. He passed on to him the sincere good wishes of family and friends, in particular Uncle Jorge, Father Maciel, and Colonel Veiga, and concluded by sending him his blessing.",CO040CL10
2651,25,"This paternal response reached Camilo in the middle of a lunch he was giving at the Café de Madrid for a couple of first-class ne’er-do-wells. His father’s response was exactly as he had expected, but he could not resist the desire to drink to his health, and was accompanied in this toast by those elegant vultures, his friends. That same day, Camilo invented one of those unforeseen difficulties mentioned by his father, and the next post carried to Brazil a long letter in which he thanked his father for his kindness, told him how much he missed him, confided his hopes for the future, and asked him very respectfully, in a postscript, to send him a small amount of money.",CO040CL10
2652,26,"Thanks to this extra help, our Camilo threw himself into a dissolute, spendthrift life, although without neglecting his studies. He was considerably helped in this by his native intelligence and a certain degree of lingering pride, and when he finished his course, he passed his exams and was awarded the degree of doctor.",CO040CL10
2653,27,"News of this success was sent to his father with a request for permission to go and visit other European countries. Permission was duly given, and he left Paris to visit Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and England. A few months later, he was back in Paris, and there he resumed his former existence, free this time from any irksome duties imposed from without.",CO040CL10
2654,28,"This promising young man ran the gamut of sensuous, frivolous pleasures with an enthusiasm that bordered on the suicidal. He had numerous solicitous, faithful friends, some of whom did not hesitate to give him the honor of becoming their creditor. He was extremely popular among the ladies of the night, a few of whom fell madly in love with him. There was not a scandal worthy of the name in which the key to his apartments was not a factor, and cet aimable brésilien was sure to be found in the best seats at any bullfight, banquet, or outing.",CO040CL10
2655,29,"Eager to see his son again, the comendador wrote asking him to return to Brazil, but the son—by now a Parisian to his fingertips—could not imagine how any man could possibly leave the capital of France and bury himself in Goiás. He proffered various excuses, and stayed put. His father allowed this first act of disobedience to pass. He wrote again some time later, summoning him home; more excuses from Camilo.",CO040CL10
2656,30,"His father grew angry, and his third letter was full of bitter recriminations. Camilo came to his senses then and, with great sadness, prepared to return to Brazil, still hopeful that he would be able to come back and end his days on the Boulevard des Italiens or at the door of the Café Helder.",CO040CL10
2657,31,"However, something happened that further delayed the young doctor’s return. Up until then, he had enjoyed only trivial love affairs and fleeting passions, but he suddenly fell head over heels in love with a beautiful Russian princess. Don’t be alarmed: the Russian princess I speak of was, at least according to some, a child of Rue du Bac and had worked in a fashion house until the Revolution of 1848.",CO040CL10
2658,32,"In the middle of the revolution, a Polish major fell in love with her and carried her off to Warsaw, where she was transformed into a princess with a name ending in -ine or -off, I’m not quite sure which. She led a mysterious life, mocking all her many adoring suitors, with the exception of Camilo, or so she said, declaring that, for him, she would be capable of setting aside her widow’s weeds. Mind you, one moment she would be uttering these thoughtless words and the next she would be gazing heavenward and protesting:",CO040CL10
2659,33,"“Ah, no, my dear Alexis, I will never besmirch your memory by marrying another.”",CO040CL10
2660,34,"These words were like dagger thrusts to Camilo’s heart. He would swear by all the saints of the Roman and Greek calendar that he had never loved anyone as he loved the beautiful princess. The cruel lady would, at times, seem disposed to believe Camilo’s protestations of love; at others, though, she would shake her head and beg forgiveness from the ghost of the venerable Prince Alexis. In the meantime, a final letter from his father arrived, giving his son one last warning, saying that if he did not come home, he would cut off all funds and bar his door to him.",CO040CL10
2661,35,"Camilo could prevaricate no longer. He considered inventing some grave illness, but the thought that his father might not believe him and might actually stop his allowance soon put paid to that particular plan. Camilo did not even have the courage to confess all to the beautiful princess, fearing that she, on a generous impulse—perfectly natural in one who is in love—might offer to share with him her lands in Novgorod. To accept such an offer would be a humiliation and to reject it might cause offense. Camilo preferred to give up Paris, leaving the princess a letter in which he gave a brief account of what had happened and a promise to return one day.",CO040CL10
2662,36,"These were the calamities that fate had chosen to heap on Camilo, and our unhappy traveler sat on in his hotel room recalling each and every one, until he heard the clock strike eight. He went out for a breath of air, but this only fueled his nostalgia for Paris. Everything seemed to him small and mean and gloomy. He gazed with Olympian disdain at all the shops on Rua do Ouvidor, which, to him, resembled a very long, if brightly lit, alleyway.",CO040CL10
2663,37,"He found the men inelegant and the women graceless. It occurred to him, however, that his hometown of Santa Luzia was even less Parisian than Rio de Janeiro, and then, cast down by this painful thought, he rushed back to the hotel and went to bed.",CO040CL10
2664,38,"The following day, immediately after breakfast, he went to see his father’s agent. He declared that he intended to leave for Goiás in the next few days, and received from him the necessary money, in accordance with his father’s orders. The agent added that he had been told to provide him with anything he might need should he wish to spend a few weeks in Rio.",CO040CL10
2665,39,"“No,” said Camilo. “There’s nothing to keep me here, and I’m eager now to set off.”",CO040CL10
2666,40,“I can imagine how homesick you must be. How many years has it been now?”,CO040CL10
2667,41,“Eight.”,CO040CL10
2668,42,“Eight! That’s a long time to be away.”,CO040CL10
2669,43,"Camilo was about to leave when in walked a tall, thin man sporting a mustache and a chinstrap beard; he was wearing a gray overcoat and a panama hat. He looked at Camilo, stopped short, took a step back, then, after a reasonable interval, exclaimed:",CO040CL10
2670,44,"“Unless I’m very much mistaken, you’re Senhor Camilo!”",CO040CL10
2671,45,"“Yes, Camilo Seabra,” replied Camilo, shooting a questioning look at the agent.",CO040CL10
2672,46,"“This gentleman,” said the agent, “is Senhor Soares, the son of the businessman of the same name from the town of Santa Luzia.”",CO040CL10
2673,47,"“You mean Leandro? Why, you only had the merest fuzz of a beard when I left . . .”",CO040CL10
2674,48,"“Yes, the very same,” said Soares, “the same Leandro who appears to you now with a full beard, like you, sir, and you also have a very fine mustache!”",CO040CL10
2675,49,“I would never have recognized you . . .”,CO040CL10
2676,50,"“Well, I recognized you the moment I saw you, even though you’ve changed enormously. You are now a very refined young gentleman, whereas I have grown old. I’m twenty-six. No, don’t laugh. I’m old. When did you arrive?”",CO040CL10
2677,51,“Yesterday.”,CO040CL10
2678,52,“And when are you planning to travel to Goiás?”,CO040CL10
2679,53,“On the first steamer to Santos.”,CO040CL10
2680,54,“Me too! We can travel together.”,CO040CL10
2681,55,“How is your father? How is everyone? Father Maciel? Colonel Veiga? Give me all the news.”,CO040CL10
2682,56,"“We’ll have plenty of time to talk. For the moment, I’ll just say that they’re all fine. Father Maciel was ill for a couple of months with a bad fever, and no one thought he would pull through, but he did. It would be disastrous were he to fall ill now that the Feast of the Holy Spirit is nearly upon us.”",CO040CL10
2683,57,“Do they still celebrate that?”,CO040CL10
2684,58,"“Of course! Colonel Veiga is Emperor this year, and he’s promised to put on a splendid show. He’s already said he’ll hold a ball. But we’ll have plenty of time to talk, either here or on the boat. Where are you staying?”",CO040CL10
2685,59,"Camilo told him the name of his hotel and said goodbye to his fellow provincial, pleased to have found a companion who would help lessen the tedium of that long journey. Soares followed Camilo over to the door and watched him walk away.",CO040CL10
2686,60,"“You see what happens when you live abroad,” he said to the agent, who had joined him. “How he’s changed, and yet once he was pretty much like me.”",CO040CL10

2689,63,"A few days later, they both set off for Santos, and from there to São Paulo, where they took the road to Goiás.",CO040CL10
2690,64,"As Soares gradually resumed his former friendship with Camilo, he told him what his life had been like during the eight years they had been apart, and, for lack of anything better, this kept Camilo amused on the occasions when nature itself offered him no spectacles of its own. A few leagues into their journey, Camilo was already fully informed of Soares’s electoral battles, hunting exploits, amorous triumphs, and many other things, some important, some banal, but which Soares recounted with equal enthusiasm and interest.",CO040CL10
2691,65,"Camilo was not a particularly observant fellow, but Soares so laid bare his soul to him that he had no option but to observe and examine it. Soares did not strike him as being a bad lad, but he was rather given to boasting about everything, be it politics, hunting, gambling, or love. There was one serious paragraph in this latter chapter, which had to do with a young woman, with whom he was so madly in love that he had vowed to kill anyone who dared so much as look at her.",CO040CL10
2692,66,"“I mean it, Camilo,” declared Soares, “if anyone is ever bold enough to court her, there will be two poor wretches in this world, him and me. It certainly won’t end happily; people there know me and know that I always keep my promises. A few months ago, Major Valente lost the election because he boldly undertook to force the municipal judge to resign. When he failed to do so, he got his just deserts, and was left off the list of candidates. And I was the one who removed his name. The thing is—”",CO040CL10
2693,67,"“But why don’t you marry the girl?” asked Camilo, thus skillfully avoiding a long account of this latest electoral triumph.",CO040CL10
2694,68,“I don’t marry her because . . . but are you really interested?”,CO040CL10
2695,69,"“Yes, as a friend, nothing more.”",CO040CL10
2696,70,“I don’t marry her because she doesn’t want to marry me.”,CO040CL10
2697,71,Camilo pulled his horse up short and asked in some amazement:,CO040CL10
2698,72,"“If she doesn’t want to, then why do you intend to stop her from marrying anyone else . . . ?”",CO040CL10
2699,73,“It’s a very long story. Isabel—”,CO040CL10
2700,74,"“Isabel?” Camilo said, interrupting him. “The daughter of Dr. Matos, who was trial court judge about ten years ago?”",CO040CL10
2701,75,“The very same.”,CO040CL10
2702,76,“She must be a young woman now.”,CO040CL10
2703,77,“She’s twenty years old.”,CO040CL10
2704,78,"“Yes, I remember how pretty she was when she was twelve.”",CO040CL10
2705,79,"“Oh, she’s changed a lot . . . for the better too! She turns the head of every man who sees her. She’s already rejected a few offers of marriage. I was the last to be rejected, and she herself came to tell me why.”",CO040CL10
2706,80,“And what did she say?”,CO040CL10
2707,81,"“ ‘Look, Senhor Soares,’ she said, ‘you deserve to be accepted as a husband by any young woman, and I myself could say yes, but the reason I don’t is that I know we would never be happy.’ ”",CO040CL10
2708,82,“What else did she say?”,CO040CL10
2709,83,“Nothing more. That was all.”,CO040CL10
2710,84,“And you never spoke to her again?”,CO040CL10
2711,85,"“No, on the contrary, we speak often. She doesn’t treat me any differently. Were it not for those words—which still wound me deeply—I could still feel as if I had a chance. I can see, though, that it’s hopeless. She doesn’t love me.”",CO040CL10
2712,86,“May I speak frankly?”,CO040CL10
2713,87,“Of course.”,CO040CL10
2714,88,“You strike me as a complete egotist.”,CO040CL10
2715,89,"“Possibly, but that’s the way I am. I feel jealous of everything, even the air she breathes. If I saw that she loved another man and could do nothing to stop the marriage, I would move to another province. What keeps me going is the belief that she never will love anyone else, which is what most people think.”",CO040CL10
2716,90,"“It doesn’t surprise me that she can’t love anyone,” said Camilo, staring across at the horizon as if he could see there the image of his beloved, that lovely subject of the Czar. “Not all women possess that heavenly gift, which is what distinguishes the most select of minds. There are some, however, who give themselves body and soul to their beloved, filling his heart with deep affection, and thus fully deserving his eternal adoration. Such women are rare, I know, but they do exist . . .”",CO040CL10
2717,91,"Camilo ended this homage to the lady of his thoughts, giving wings to a sigh, and had that sigh failed to reach its destination, this would not have been for want of trying on the part of its originator. His companion did not understand what lay behind this speech and repeated that the lovely Isabel was very far from loving anyone and he was still further from allowing her to do so.",CO040CL10
2718,92,"This subject was pleasing to both men, and they continued to speak of it until dusk fell. Shortly afterward, they reached an inn, where they would spend the night.",CO040CL10
2719,93,"Once the servants had unloaded the mules, coffee and then supper were prepared. It was on such occasions that our hero missed Paris most keenly. What a difference between the suppers he had enjoyed at restaurants on the boulevards and that light, rough-and-ready meal in a miserable roadside inn, with none of the delicacies of French cuisine and no Figaro or Gazette des Tribunaux to read!",CO040CL10
2720,94,"Camilo sighed and grew even less communicative. Not that this mattered, because his companion talked enough for both of them.",CO040CL10
2721,95,"Once supper was over, Camilo lit an expensive cigar and Soares a rather cheaper one. It was dark by then. The fire that had been lit for supper illuminated a small area around about, although this was hardly necessary, for a pale, brilliant moon was beginning to rise behind a hill, its light glancing off the leaves of the trees and the quiet waters of the river snaking past nearby.",CO040CL10
2722,96,"One of the muleteers took out a guitar and began singing a song, the rustic simplicity of whose words and melody would have delighted anyone, but for Camilo it merely stirred sad memories of the trills and tremolos he used to hear at the opera. Other memories surfaced too: one night when the lovely Muscovite, seated languidly in a box at the Comédie-Italienne, stopped listening to the tenor’s tender yearnings in order, instead, to gaze on Camilo, peering at him from afar over a nosegay of violets.",CO040CL10
2723,97,Soares climbed into his hammock and fell asleep.,CO040CL10
2724,98,"The muleteer stopped singing, and soon all was silence.",CO040CL10
2725,99,"Camilo remained alone in the lovely, solemn night. He was certainly not immune to beauty, and the near-novelty of that spectacle, which he had forgotten after his long absence, made a deep impression on him.",CO040CL10
2726,100,"Now and then, he heard the distant howling of some wild animal wandering the wilderness. At other times, he heard night birds calling sadly. The crickets and frogs and toads formed part of the chorus in that opera of the wild, and much as our hero admired it, he would doubtless have preferred to be listening to an opéra bouffe.",CO040CL10
2727,101,"He remained like this for a long time, almost two hours, letting his thoughts drift wherever his fancy took him, building up and tearing down endless castles in the air. Suddenly he was woken from his reverie by the voice of Soares, who seemed to be in the grip of a nightmare. Camilo listened and heard the occasional muffled word:",CO040CL10
2728,102,"“Isabel . . . dear Isabel . . . What? Oh, dear God! Help!”",CO040CL10
2729,103,"These last words were spoken in far more anguished tones than the first. Camilo ran to his friend’s side and shook him hard. Soares started awake, sat up, and, looking around him, murmured:",CO040CL10
2730,104,“What’s wrong?”,CO040CL10
2731,105,“You were having a nightmare.”,CO040CL10
2732,106,"“Oh, yes, it was a nightmare. Thank heavens for that. What time is it?”",CO040CL10
2733,107,“It’s still dark.”,CO040CL10
2734,108,“Are you awake already?”,CO040CL10

2736,110,"“Tomorrow, I’ll tell you my dream.”",CO040CL10
2737,111,"And the next day, when they were only a few yards into their journey, Soares told him about that terrible dream.",CO040CL10
2738,112,"“I was standing by a river,” he said, “with a rifle in my hand, watching for capybara. I happened to glance up at a steep hill on the other side and saw a young woman riding a black horse. She was all dressed in black, too, and her black hair hung loose over her shoulders.”",CO040CL10
2739,113,"“Nothing but blackness, then,” commented Camilo, interrupting him.",CO040CL10
2740,114,"“No, listen. I was really surprised to see her there and on horseback, too, a delicate young woman like her. Who do you think she was?”",CO040CL10
2741,115,“Isabel?”,CO040CL10
2742,116,"“Yes, Isabel. I ran along the bank and climbed onto a rock just opposite where she had stopped, and I asked her what she was doing there. She remained silent for a while, then, pointing down into the depths of the river, she said:",CO040CL10

2744,118,“ ‘Ah!’,CO040CL10

2749,123,"“ ‘Well, then, go and fetch my hat.’",CO040CL10
2750,124,"“I stared down into a vast chasm in which the muddy, churning water boiled and roared. Instead of being carried downstream to be lost forever, her hat had become caught on an outcrop of rock and seemed to be inviting me to go and fetch it. However, this was quite impossible. I looked all around me to see if I could find a way, but in vain.”",CO040CL10
2751,125,“What a febrile imagination you have!” remarked Camilo.,CO040CL10
2752,126,"“I kept searching for the right words to dissuade Isabel from sending me on that terrifying mission, when I felt someone place a hand on my shoulder. I turned around. It was a man. It was you.”",CO040CL10
2753,127,“Me?”,CO040CL10
2754,128,"“Yes. You regarded me scornfully, then smiled at her and stared into the abyss. Suddenly, I don’t know how, you were down there, reaching out to grab the fateful hat.”",CO040CL10
2755,129,“Goodness.”,CO040CL10
2756,130,"“The waters, however, grew still wilder and threatened to drown you. Uttering an anguished cry, Isabel spurred on her horse and plunged in too. I shouted,",CO040CL10
2757,131,"called for help, but it was no use. The swirling water had enveloped you both . . . It was then that you woke me.”",CO040CL10
2758,132,"When Leandro Soares concluded this account of his nightmare, he still seemed terrified by what had happened, even though it had all been in his imagination. I should point out that he believed in dreams.",CO040CL10
2759,133,"“That’s what happens when you go to sleep on a full stomach!” cried Camilo, once Soares had finished his account. “What tosh! The hat, the river, the horse, and, to top it all, my presence in that fantastical melodrama; it’s simply the creation of someone with a bad case of indigestion. Some theaters in Paris put on nightmares like that, which are far worse because they’re much longer. What is clear to me is that you’re still thinking of that girl even when you’re asleep.”",CO040CL10
2760,134,"“Yes, even when I’m asleep.”",CO040CL10
2761,135,"Soares spoke these last words almost like a disembodied echo. After finishing his description of his dream, and after listening to what Camilo had to say, he had a series of thoughts that remained hidden from the author of this story. The most I can say is that they were clearly not happy thoughts, because he bowed his head, furrowed his brow, and, fixing his gaze on his horse’s ears, withdrew into an inviolable silence.",CO040CL10
2762,136,"From that day on, Camilo found the journey less bearable. Apart from the vague melancholy that had taken hold of his traveling companion, he was beginning to grow bored with riding league after apparently endless league.",CO040CL10
2763,137,"Eventually, Soares recovered his customary verbosity, but, by then, nothing could dispel the mortal tedium overwhelming poor Camilo.",CO040CL10
2764,138,"However, when they spotted the town, near to the farm where Camilo had spent his early youth, he felt his heart beat faster. He grew serious. For a while, at least, Paris and its splendors gave way to the small, honest homeland of the Seabra family.",CO040CL10

2766,140,THE MEETING,CO040CL10
2767,141,"It was real day of celebration when the comendador clasped to his breast the son he had dispatched to foreign lands eight years before. The kind old man could not hold back his tears, for they sprang from a heart still brimming with love and overflowing with tenderness.",CO040CL10
2768,142,"Camilo’s joy was no less intense or sincere. He repeatedly kissed his father’s hands and brow, embraced other relatives and friends from his youth, and, for a few days, albeit not many, he appeared to be completely cured of any desire to return to Europe.",CO040CL10
2769,143,"In the town itself and its environs, people spoke of nothing else. The comendador’s son was the sole, exclusive topic of conversation. People never wearied of praising him. They admired his manners and his elegance. Even the rather superior way in which he spoke found sincere enthusiasts.",CO040CL10
2770,144,"For many days, it was absolutely impossible for the young man to do anything but recount his travels to his adoring compatriots. It was worth the effort, though, because everything he said had for them an indefinable charm.",CO040CL10
2771,145,<null>,CO040CL10
2772,146,"Father Maciel, who had baptized him twenty-seven years before, and who was seeing him now a grown man, was the first to speak of this transformation.",CO040CL10
2773,147,"“You must be very proud, sir,” he said to Camilo’s father, “you must be very proud that heaven has given you such a fine son! Now, it may just be my own fondness for the young man, who, only yesterday, was a mere scrap of a boy, but I think Santa Luzia is going to have a first-class doctor. And not just a doctor, either, but a philosopher, because he really does seem to me to be a philosopher too. I sounded him out on the matter yesterday, and I couldn’t fault his reply.”",CO040CL10
2774,148,Uncle Jorge was always asking everyone what they thought of his nephew. Colonel Veiga was constantly thanking Providence for Camilo’s arrival so close to the Feast of the Holy Spirit.,CO040CL10
2775,149,"“Without him, the ball would have been incomplete.”",CO040CL10
2776,150,"Dr. Matos was the last person to visit the comendador’s son. He was a tall, robust old man, only slightly bowed down by the years.",CO040CL10
2777,151,<null>,CO040CL10
2778,152,"“Come in, Doctor,” said Camilo’s father as soon as he arrived, “come in and meet my young man.”",CO040CL10
2779,153,"“And he is indeed a man,” answered Dr. Matos, looking at Camilo. “He’s more of a man than I imagined. But then, it has been eight years. Let me embrace you, sir.”",CO040CL10
2780,154,"Camilo opened his arms to the old man. Then, as he did with all those who came to visit him, he told him a little of his travels and his studies. Needless to say, our hero omitted anything that might tarnish his image. If he was to be believed, he had more or less lived the life of a hermit, and no one dared think otherwise.",CO040CL10
2781,155,"Joy was unbounded in the town and its environs, and, flattered by this unexpectedly warm reception, Camilo rarely thought about Paris.",CO040CL10
2782,156,"But time passes, and our feelings alter. After two weeks, the novelty of those first impressions had worn off; the farm began to change in appearance: the fields seemed monotonous, the trees monotonous, the rivers monotonous, the town monotonous, he himself seemed monotonous. He was filled then by what we might call the nostalgia of exile.",CO040CL10
2783,157,"“No,” he said to himself, “I cannot possibly stay here for another three months. It’s either Paris or the graveyard, that’s the choice I’m faced with. In three months’ time, I’ll either be dead or en route to Europe.”",CO040CL10
2784,158,"Camilo’s boredom did not escape his father, who spent almost all his time gazing at his son.",CO040CL10
2785,159,"“He’s right,” thought the comendador. “No one who has lived in those beautiful, lively places could ever be very happy here. He needs something to occupy him—politics, for example.”",CO040CL10
2786,160,"“Politics!” cried Camilo, when his father mentioned this as a possibility. “Where would politics get me, Father?”",CO040CL10
2787,161,"“A long way. You could become the province’s first deputy, then join the Chamber of Deputies in Rio de Janeiro. One day, you could challenge the government, and if it fell, you might then get a seat in the cabinet. Have you never wanted to be a minister?”",CO040CL10
2788,162,“Never.”,CO040CL10
2789,163,“That’s a shame.”,CO040CL10
2790,164,“Why?”,CO040CL10
2791,165,“Because it’s good to be a minister.”,CO040CL10
2792,166,"“What, and try to govern other men?” said Camilo, laughing. “The male sex is entirely ungovernable, Father. Personally, I prefer the fairer sex.”",CO040CL10
2793,167,"Seabra laughed, too, but still did not lose hope of one day convincing his son and heir.",CO040CL10
2794,168,Camilo had been in his father’s house for nearly three weeks when he recalled what Soares had told him and the dream he’d had.,CO040CL10
2795,169,"The first time he went into town and met Soares, he asked:",CO040CL10
2796,170,"“Tell me, how’s your Isabel? I haven’t so much as caught a glimpse of her yet.”",CO040CL10
2797,171,"Soares gave him a louring look, shrugged, and muttered:",CO040CL10
2798,172,“I don’t know.”,CO040CL10
2799,173,"Camilo did not insist, thinking:",CO040CL10
2800,174,“His illness is obviously still at the acute stage.”,CO040CL10
2801,175,"He was curious, though, to see the lovely Isabel, who had brought that garrulous electioneer so low. He had already spoken to every other girl for ten leagues around. Isabel was the only one who had so far eluded him. No, “eluded” is the wrong word. Camilo had visited Dr. Matos’s farm once, but his daughter had been ill. Or so he was told.",CO040CL10
2802,176,"“Don’t worry,” said a neighbor to whom he had expressed his impatience to meet Leandro Soares’s beloved, “you’ll see her at Colonel Veiga’s ball, or at the Holy Spirit festivities, or on some other occasion.”",CO040CL10
2803,177,"Various things could not help but prick Camilo’s curiosity: the young woman’s beauty—even though he could not believe it could possibly be superior or even equal to that of Prince Alexis’s widow—together with Soares’s own unquenchable passion, and the mysterious tone in which people spoke of Isabel.",CO040CL10
2804,178,"The following Sunday, eight days before the Festival of the Holy Spirit, Camilo left the farm to attend mass at the church in town, as he had on the previous Sundays. His horse trotted slowly along, and his thoughts kept the same indolent pace, spreading out over the countryside in eager search of some lost sensation it yearned to have again.",CO040CL10
2805,179,"A thousand remarkable ideas passed through Camilo’s mind. One moment he was wishing he could fly through the air, horse and all, and land slap-bang in front of the Palais Royal, or any other spot in the world’s capital city. The next he was imagining some great deluge that would sweep him off to have lunch in Café Tortoni just two minutes after kneeling at Father Maciel’s altar.",CO040CL10
2806,180,<null>,CO040CL10
2807,181,"Suddenly, in the distance, as he rounded a bend in the road, he saw two ladies on horseback, accompanied by a page. Spurring his horse, he soon caught up with them. One of the ladies turned, smiled, and stopped. Camilo doffed his hat and held out his hand, which she shook.",CO040CL10
2808,182,"This lady was the wife of Colonel Veiga. She was probably about forty-five, but certainly did not look her age. The other lady, aware that her companion had stopped, also stopped and turned around. Camilo had not yet looked at her, however, for he was listening to Dona Gertrudes, who was giving him news of the colonel.",CO040CL10
2809,183,"“He thinks of nothing but the festivities now,” she was saying. “He’s probably at church already. Are you going to mass?”",CO040CL10
2810,184,“I am.”,CO040CL10
2811,185,"“Let’s go together, then.”",CO040CL10
2812,186,"After this rapid exchange, Camilo finally looked at the other rider. She, however, was already some way ahead. He drew his horse up alongside Dona Gertrudes, and the procession set off again. They had been chatting for about ten minutes, when the horse of the lady in front came to an abrupt halt.",CO040CL10
2813,187,<null>,CO040CL10
2814,188,"“What is it, Isabel?” asked Dona Gertrudes.",CO040CL10
2815,189,"“Isabel?” cried Camilo, oblivious to the incident that had provoked Dona Gertrudes’s question.",CO040CL10
2816,190,"The young woman turned and shrugged, saying only:",CO040CL10
2817,191,“I don’t know.”,CO040CL10
2818,192,"The horse had heard a noise coming from the thick bamboo grove to the left of the road, but before Camilo’s page could discover the cause of the horse’s reluctance to proceed, the young woman had made a supreme effort and, vigorously whipping her horse, had managed to persuade it to overcome its fear and gallop on ahead.",CO040CL10
2819,193,“Isabel?” Camilo said again. “Is that young woman Dr. Matos’s daughter?”,CO040CL10
2820,194,"“Yes, didn’t you recognize her?”",CO040CL10
2821,195,“I haven’t seen her for eight years. She’s a real beauty! I’m not surprised that people here talk so much about her. I was told she’d been ill . . .”,CO040CL10
2822,196,"“She has, but her illnesses are minor things. It’s her nerves, apparently; at least that, I believe, is what people say when they don’t know what’s wrong with someone.”",CO040CL10
2823,197,"Isabel had stopped farther up the road, and seemed to be admiring the splendors of the nature around her. They almost caught up with her a few minutes later, and she was just about to ride on, when Dona Gertrudes called to her:",CO040CL10
2824,198,“Isabel!”,CO040CL10
2825,199,"The young woman turned, and Dona Gertrudes rode over to her.",CO040CL10
2826,200,“Don’t you remember Dr. Camilo Seabra?”,CO040CL10
2827,201,"“You may not remember me,” said Camilo. “You were only twelve when I left, and that was eight years ago!”",CO040CL10
2828,202,"“No, I do remember,” answered Isabel, slightly turning her head, but still without looking at him.",CO040CL10
2829,203,"Then, gently urging on her horse, she rode ahead. Although this was rather a strange way to greet an old acquaintance, what most impressed Camilo was Isabel’s beauty, which thoroughly deserved its reputation.",CO040CL10
2830,204,"As far as he could judge from that first encounter, the slender horsewoman was tall rather than short. She had an olive complexion, but her skin was satin-smooth, with a faint rosy tinge, doubtless the effect of her agitation, for people usually described her as very pale.",CO040CL10
2831,205,"Camilo had not been able to see what color her eyes were, but despite this, and possibly more importantly, he had sensed their brightness, and understood at once how the eyes of that lovely maiden could have so enchanted poor Soares.",CO040CL10
2832,206,"He did not have time to study her other features, but was able to contemplate at his leisure what he had already admired from afar, namely, her naturally elegant, upright posture, and the graceful ease with which she rode.",CO040CL10
2833,207,"He had seen many elegant, skillful horsewomen, but she had a quality that gave her an advantage over them all; perhaps it was her easy, casual gestures or the spontaneity of her movements, or something else entirely, or a combination of all those things, that gave this interesting young woman incontestable supremacy.",CO040CL10
2834,208,"Isabel occasionally slowed her horse and spoke to Dona Gertrudes, pointing out some trick of the light or a bird flying by or a sound she had heard—but not once did she turn to face Camilo or give him so much as a sideways glance.",CO040CL10
2835,209,"Absorbed in contemplation of her, Camilo let the conversation lapse, and he and Dona Gertrudes rode along in silence for some minutes. They were interrupted by another rider approaching at a fast trot from behind.",CO040CL10
2836,210,It was Soares.,CO040CL10
2837,211,"He seemed completely different from their last encounter. He greeted them all in the same smiling, jovial manner he had affected during the first few days of his journey with Camilo. It was easy enough, though, to see that this was all a façade. His face would cloud over from time to time, or he would make a despairing gesture which, fortunately, escaped the notice of the others.",CO040CL10
2838,212,<null>,CO040CL10
2839,213,"He feared the triumph of a man who was his physical and intellectual superior, and who, what’s more, had the great advantage of being very much in the public eye: the main attraction, the star performer, the man of the moment. Everything was conspiring to demolish Soares’s last hope, which was to see the young woman die without ever marrying. This unfortunate lover had the all-too-common tendency of wishing to see the cup he himself could not raise to his lips lying shattered or useless.",CO040CL10
2840,214,"His fear had grown all the greater, when, hiding in the bamboo grove to watch Isabel ride by, as he often did, he saw Camilo in their company. He could not suppress a cry of surprise and even took a step in their direction, but stopped himself in time.",CO040CL10
2841,215,"As we saw, the party rode on, leaving the jealous suitor swearing to all the powers in heaven and on earth that he would have his revenge on his bold rival, if, indeed, he was his rival.",CO040CL10
2842,216,"As we well know, he was not a rival; the memory of the Muscovite Artemis was still fresh in Camilo’s heart, and despite the distance that lay now between them, he could still feel her ardent, sorrowful tears. But who could persuade Leandro Soares that the elegant “young man from Europe,” as people called him, would not fall in love with that elusive young woman?",CO040CL10
2843,217,"Isabel, on the other hand, reined in her horse as soon as she saw her unfortunate suitor and affectionately held out her hand to him, accompanying this gesture with the most adorable of smiles. This was not enough, alas, to dispel the poor young man’s doubts. Camilo, however, interpreted her actions quite differently.",CO040CL10
2844,218,"“She either loves him or she’s a complete fraud,” he thought.",CO040CL10
2845,219,"At that precise moment—and for the first time—Isabel chanced to look at Camilo. Whether through instinct or sheer perspicacity, she read this hidden thought of his; she frowned slightly and a look of such bewilderment crossed her face that Camilo felt utterly perplexed and could not help adding, this time actually murmuring the words:",CO040CL10
2846,220,“Or else she’s in league with the devil.”,CO040CL10
2847,221,"“Perhaps she is,” responded Isabel softly, her gaze fixed now on the ground.",CO040CL10
2848,222,"These words were spoken so quietly that no one else heard. Half astonished, half curious, Camilo could not take his eyes off the lovely Isabel after those words uttered in such strange circumstances. Soares was gazing at Camilo as tenderly as a hawk looks at a pigeon. Isabel was playing with her whip. Dona Gertrudes, afraid they might miss Father Maciel’s mass and be affectionately scolded by her husband, gave orders for them to proceed, and so they did.",CO040CL10

2850,224,THE FESTIVAL,CO040CL10
2851,225,"The following Saturday, the town had a very different air about it. Crowds of people had arrived to join in the annual Festival of the Holy Spirit.",CO040CL10
2852,226,"Very few places have entirely lost their taste for such old-fashioned celebrations, a remnant from past ages, which the writers of future centuries will study with interest in order to describe to their contemporaries a Brazil they will no longer recognize.",CO040CL10

2857,231,"At the time of these events, one of the most authentic of such festivals was that held in the town of Santa Luzia.",CO040CL10
2858,232,"Colonel Veiga, who had been appointed that year’s Emperor of the Holy Spirit, was staying in a house he owned in town.",CO040CL10
2859,233,"This was the meeting place on the Saturday night for the traditional group of shepherds and shepherdesses, who all arrived in their picturesque outfits, accompanied by the classic “old man” in breeches and stockings, flat shoes, a long vest and overcoat, and holding a large stick.",CO040CL10
2860,234,"Camilo was at the colonel’s house for the arrival of the shepherds, with, at their head, a few musicians and, behind them, a whole throng of people. They formed a circle out in the street, and a shepherd and shepherdess initiated the dancing. Then everyone danced, sang, and played both outside the house and in the colonel’s parlor, and the colonel was quite beside himself with glee. It is a moot point, and one that will probably never be resolved, whether, on that day, Colonel Veiga actually preferred being Emperor of the Divine Holy Spirit to being a government minister.",CO040CL10
2861,235,"And yet this was merely a small example of the colonel’s majestic status. The Sunday morning sun would reveal far greater things. And this, it seems, was why the king of light chose to bless that day with his finest rays, for the sky had never been more limpidly blue. Overnight, a few dark clouds had rather dimmed the hopes of the festivalgoers; fortunately, though, a stiff morning breeze had swept the sky clean and freshened the air.",CO040CL10
2862,236,"The population responded to nature’s bounty, and, bright and early, sallied forth in their Sunday best, joking, laughing, talking, and feeling utterly content.",CO040CL10
2863,237,"The air crackled with fireworks, and the church bells gaily summoned the people to worship.",CO040CL10
2864,238,"Camilo had spent the night in town at Father Maciel’s house, and was woken far earlier than expected by the bells and fireworks and other festive noises. At his father’s house, he had kept to his Parisian habits, and the comendador judged it best not to disrupt this pattern. He woke at eleven in the morning, except on Sundays, when he would go to mass so as not entirely to offend against the local customs.",CO040CL10
2865,239,"“What on earth is going on, Father Maciel?” shouted Camilo from his room, when the flashing lights from a girandola firework finally forced him to open his eyes.",CO040CL10
2866,240,"“What do you think?” answered Father Maciel, poking his head around the door. “It’s the start of the festival.”",CO040CL10
2867,241,“You mean they begin in the middle of the night?”,CO040CL10
2868,242,"“What do you mean, ‘the middle of the night’?” exclaimed Father Maciel. “It’s broad daylight.”",CO040CL10
2869,243,"Unable to go back to sleep, Camilo was obliged to leave his bed. He had breakfast with the priest, recounted a few anecdotes, declared that Paris was the ideal city, and set off for the Emperor’s house. Father Maciel left with him, and on the way, they saw Leandro Soares in the distance.",CO040CL10
2870,244,"“Can you tell me, Father,” asked Camilo, “why Dr. Matos’s daughter refuses to accept that poor man’s love?”",CO040CL10
2871,245,Father Maciel adjusted his spectacles and gave the following thoughtful response.,CO040CL10
2872,246,“That’s a rather foolish question.”,CO040CL10
2873,247,"“It can’t be so very foolish,” retorted Camilo, “because I’m hardly the only person to have asked it.”",CO040CL10
2874,248,"“That’s true,” said the priest, “but one shouldn’t necessarily repeat what other people say. Isabel doesn’t love Soares because she doesn’t love him.”",CO040CL10
2875,249,“Don’t you think her slightly strange?”,CO040CL10
2876,250,"“No,” said the priest, “she seems to me extremely astute.”",CO040CL10
2877,251,“Why so?”,CO040CL10
2878,252,“I suspect that she’s very ambitious. She doesn’t accept Soares’s protestations of love because she wants to see if she can get a husband who will open a door for her into the world of politics.”,CO040CL10
2879,253,"“Surely not!” said Camilo, shrugging dismissively.",CO040CL10
2880,254,“You don’t believe me?”,CO040CL10
2881,255,"“No, I don’t.”",CO040CL10
2882,256,"“I may be wrong, but I think that is the real reason. Everyone here has his own explanation as to why Isabel won’t marry. However, all their explanations strike me as absurd. I think mine is much better.”",CO040CL10
2883,257,<null>,CO040CL10
2884,258,"Camilo made a few further objections, then said goodbye and headed for the colonel’s house.",CO040CL10
2885,259,"The Emperor of the festivities could barely contain his excitement. This was the first time he had held this honorific post and he was determined to carry out his duties brilliantly, even more brilliantly than his predecessors. While this demonstrated a perfectly natural desire not to be outdone, there was also an element of political envy. Behind his back, some of his opponents were saying that the proud colonel wasn’t up to the job.",CO040CL10
2886,260,"“I’ll show them,” he said when certain friends reported this malicious gossip to him.",CO040CL10
2887,261,"Camilo entered the room as the colonel was in the process of giving some last-minute instructions about the supper that would follow the festivities, and listening to the details that one of the fraternity brethren was giving him about the ceremony in the sacristy.",CO040CL10
2888,262,"“I won’t keep you, Colonel,” said Camilo once he was alone with Veiga, “I’d hate to delay you.”",CO040CL10
2889,263,"“No, not at all,” said the Emperor of the Divine Holy Spirit, “everything’s in hand. Is your father coming?”",CO040CL10
2890,264,"“Yes, he should be here already.”",CO040CL10

2893,267,"“It’s looking very pretty. I don’t wish to boast, but I think the festivities will certainly be as good as those of other years, if not better.”",CO040CL10
2894,268,"It was absolutely impossible to disagree with this opinion when the man giving it was doing so in his own honor. Camilo, in turn, praised the celebrations. The colonel listened to him with a rather smug smile on his face, and was about to point out to his young friend that he clearly didn’t appreciate their full significance, when Camilo changed the subject and asked:",CO040CL10
2895,269,“Has Dr. Matos arrived?”,CO040CL10
2896,270,"“Yes, he has.”",CO040CL10
2897,271,“With his family?”,CO040CL10
2898,272,"“Yes, with his family.”",CO040CL10
2899,273,"At this point, they were interrupted by the sound of approaching music and many fireworks exploding.",CO040CL10
2900,274,“It’s them!” cried Veiga. “They’re coming to fetch me. If you’ll excuse me.”,CO040CL10
2901,275,"And with that he rushed upstairs to change his black trousers and linen jacket for the uniform and insignia appropriate to his lofty position. Camilo went over to the window to watch the procession arrive, which it soon did, composed of a band of musicians, the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit, and the shepherds and shepherdesses from the night before.",CO040CL10
2902,276,"The brethren were wearing their scarlet chasubles and were walking slowly and gravely along, surrounded by the crowds filling the street and clustering around the door to the colonel’s house, waiting for him to emerge.",CO040CL10
2903,277,"When the procession stopped outside, the music also stopped, and all eyes peered curiously up at the windows. However, the new Emperor had not yet finished dressing, and the onlookers had to content themselves with looking at Camilo.",CO040CL10
2904,278,"Meanwhile, four or five of the higher-ranking brethren had left the group and climbed the steps to the colonel’s front door.",CO040CL10
2905,279,"Minutes later, those same high-ranking brethren were greeting Camilo, one of them higher up than the others and not just as regards his rank, for Major Brás’s great height would have been his most notable feature were it not in direct competition with his extreme thinness.",CO040CL10
2906,280,"Despite this, the major’s chasuble fit him well, because it neither hung down below his knees, as it did with the others, nor just below his waist, as it would have done had it been made to the same measurements. It was a sort of middle way. It reached to just above the knee, and had been made specifically to reconcile the major’s enormous stature with the accepted principles of elegance.",CO040CL10
2907,281,All the brethren shook Camilo’s hand and asked anxiously for the colonel.,CO040CL10
2908,282,"“He won’t be long,” said Camilo. “He’s just getting dressed.”",CO040CL10
2909,283,"“The church is full,” said one of the brethren. “We’re just waiting for the colonel now.”",CO040CL10
2910,284,"“And it’s only right that we should wait,” said Major Brás.",CO040CL10
2911,285,"“Seconded,” said the brethren in unison.",CO040CL10
2912,286,"“Besides,” added the immensely tall officer, “we have plenty of time. We don’t have to go far.”",CO040CL10
2913,287,"The other brethren nodded their assent, and the major then went on to tell Camilo how much work both he and his colleagues had put into organizing the festival—in fact, just as much work as the colonel.",CO040CL10
2914,288,“As a reward for our modest efforts”—Camilo dismissed this remark with a shake of his head—“things shouldn’t go too badly.”,CO040CL10
2915,289,The major had barely spoken these words when the colonel appeared at the door to the parlor in all his splendor.,CO040CL10
2916,290,"Camilo had no idea what the Emperor’s uniform and insignia would be like, and so he regarded him with some astonishment.",CO040CL10
2917,291,"As well as the black trousers, which he had been wearing when Camilo had arrived, the colonel had donned a tailcoat, whose cut and style could have rivaled that of the most impeccably dressed member of the Cassino Fluminense. So far, so good.",CO040CL10
2918,292,"On his chest glinted the vast insignia of the Order of the Rose, which, again, was perfectly acceptable. However, what exceeded all expectation, and what accounted for the look of amazement on Camilo’s face, was the gleaming, ornate crown made of cardboard and gold paper that the colonel had on his head.",CO040CL10
2919,293,"Camilo took a step back and fixed his eyes on the colonel’s imperial crown. He had forgotten that this was an indispensable item on such occasions, and, after living for eight years in a very different culture, he had assumed that such costumes would have long since been dead and buried.",CO040CL10
2920,294,The colonel shook hands with all his friends and declared that he was ready to accompany them.,CO040CL10
2921,295,"“We don’t want to keep the people waiting,” he said.",CO040CL10
2922,296,"They immediately went out into the street. The crowd stirred into life when they caught sight of the scarlet chasuble worn by one of the brethren. Behind him came another chasuble, quickly followed by all the other chasubles, on either side of the richly adorned Emperor.",CO040CL10
2923,297,"As soon as the sun’s rays fell on the golden crown, it glinted and glittered in the most extraordinary fashion. The colonel looked to left and right, nodding to various people in the throng, then took up the place of honor in the procession. The band immediately broke into a march, and off they all went to the church, the colonel, the brotherhood, the shepherds and shepherdesses.",CO040CL10
2924,298,"As soon as the procession came within sight of the church, the bell ringer, who had been watching and waiting, put into practice all the most complicated tricks of his trade, while a girandola, along with a few other stray fireworks, announced to the heavens that the Emperor of the Divine Holy Spirit had arrived.",CO040CL10
2925,299,"His arrival caused general excitement in the church. A burly, energetic master of ceremonies was trying, albeit with great difficulty, to clear a path through, but the disorderly crowd kept undoing all his good work.",CO040CL10
2926,300,"Finally, what always happens on these occasions happened, and a path opened up of its own accord, and, with some effort, the colonel made his way through the crush, preceded and accompanied by the members of the fraternity, until he reached the throne that had been placed next to the altar.",CO040CL10
2927,301,"He confidently climbed the steps up to the throne and sat down as proudly as if he were Emperor of all the empires of the world. When Camilo arrived at the church, the ceremony had already begun. He found a reasonable place to sit, or, rather, an excellent one, because it provided him with a view of a large group of ladies, among them the lovely Isabel.",CO040CL10
2928,302,Camilo was anxious to speak to Isabel again. He could not forget their encounter on the road and the remarkable perspicacity she had shown on that occasion.,CO040CL10
2929,303,"She appeared not to notice him, but Camilo was so experienced in dealing with the fairer sex that he realized at once that she had, in fact, seen him and was deliberately avoiding his gaze. This, along with the incidents of the previous Sunday, made the following question surface in his mind:",CO040CL10
2930,304,“What has she got against me?”,CO040CL10
2931,305,<null>,CO040CL10
2932,306,<null>,CO040CL10
2933,307,"The ceremony continued without further incident. Camilo did not take his eyes off his beautiful enigma, as he already called her, but the enigma seemed immune to any feelings of curiosity.",CO040CL10
2934,308,"Once, though, toward the end of the ceremony, their eyes did meet. It should be pointed out that he found her looking at him. He bowed, she reciprocated, and that was that.",CO040CL10
2935,309,"Once the ceremony was over, the brotherhood escorted the colonel back to his house. In the hurly-burly of leaving the church, Camilo, who still had his eyes fixed on Isabel, heard an unfamiliar voice whisper in his ear:",CO040CL10
2936,310,“Watch what you’re doing!”,CO040CL10
2937,311,"Camilo turned and came face-to-face with a short, thin man with small, bright eyes; he was poorly but neatly dressed. They stared at each other for a few seconds in silence. Camilo didn’t recognize the face and didn’t dare demand an explanation for the words he had just heard, even though he was burning to know more.",CO040CL10
2938,312,"“There’s a mystery,” the stranger said at last. “Would you like to know what it is?”",CO040CL10
2939,313,Another silence.,CO040CL10
2940,314,"“This is hardly the appropriate place,” said Camilo, “but if you have something to tell me . . .”",CO040CL10
2941,315,"“No, you must find out for yourself.”",CO040CL10
2942,316,"And with that, the short, thin man with the small, bright eyes vanished into the crowd. Camilo elbowed his way past ten or twelve people, trod on fifteen or twenty corns, apologizing just as often for his rash behavior, only to find himself out in the street with not a sign of the stranger.",CO040CL10
2943,317,"“This is like a novel,” he said. “I’m caught up in the middle of a novel!”",CO040CL10
2944,318,"At that moment, Isabel, Dona Gertrudes, and Dr. Matos came out of the church. Camilo went over to greet them. Dr. Matos gave his arm to Dona Gertrudes, and Camilo timidly offered his to Isabel.",CO040CL10
2945,319,"She hesitated, but since she could hardly refuse, she linked arms with him, and they walked to the colonel’s house, where the colonel and various other important people were already installed.",CO040CL10
2946,320,"In the midst of the throng, another man was making his way to the colonel’s house, and he did not once take his eyes off Camilo and Isabel. That man bit his lip until it bled. Need I add that the man was Leandro Soares?",CO040CL10

2948,322,PASSION,CO040CL10
2949,323,"It was only a short distance from the church to the house, and the conversation between Isabel and Camilo was neither long nor sustained. And yet, dear reader, if the Muscovite princess deserves any sympathy at all, then now is the time to take pity on her,",CO040CL10
2950,324,"for the dawn of a new feeling was beginning to gild the peaks of Camilo’s heart. As they went up the steps to the colonel’s house, Camilo had to admit to himself that the intriguing Isabel was possessed of qualities far superior to those of the lovely Russian princess. An hour and a half later—that is, toward the end of supper—Camilo’s heart confirmed the discovery made by his inquiring mind.",CO040CL10
2951,325,"The couple stuck entirely to neutral topics of conversation, but Isabel spoke with such sweetness and grace—although always with her habitual reserve—and her eyes, seen from close up, were so pretty, as was her hair and her mouth, not to mention her hands, that our ardent young hero could only have resisted the allure of such combined charms had he entirely changed his nature.",CO040CL10
2952,326,"Supper passed without incident. The colonel had gathered together all the local worthies: the priest, the magistrate, the merchant, the farmer, and the utmost cordiality and harmony reigned from one end of the table to the other.",CO040CL10
2953,327,"The Emperor of the Divine Holy Spirit, now back in his normal clothes, presided over the table with real enthusiasm. The festival was the main topic of conversation, intermingled, it’s true, with a few political reflections, with which everyone agreed, because the men and women present all belonged to the same party.",CO040CL10
2954,328,<null>,CO040CL10
2955,329,"Major Brás was in the habit of making one or two long, eloquent toasts at any important supper to which he was invited. His facility as a speaker had no rival in the entire province. Moreover, given his great height, he could dominate any audience simply by getting to his feet.",CO040CL10
2956,330,"He could not allow the colonel’s supper to pass without some intervention on his part; dessert was about to be served when the eloquent major asked permission to say a few simple, artless words. A murmur equivalent to a round of nays in the Chamber of Deputies greeted this announcement, and the audience prepared their ears to receive the pearls about to fall from his lips.",CO040CL10
2957,331,"“This illustrious audience,” he said, “will forgive my boldness. I speak not simply because I can, ladies and gentlemen, no, I speak from the heart. My toast will be a brief one; in order to celebrate the virtues and abilities of our illustrious Colonel Veiga no long speech is necessary. His name says it all, and my voice would add nothing new . . .”",CO040CL10
2958,332,"The audience gave an indication that while it unreservedly applauded the first part of that sentence, it had its reservations about the second, thus complimenting both the colonel and the major; and the speaker, who, if he was to be true to what he had just said, should merely have drained his glass, continued as follows:",CO040CL10
2959,333,"“I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the extraordinary event we have just witnessed will never be expunged from our memories. This town and other towns have seen many Festivals of the Holy Spirit, but never have the people enjoyed a more splendid, lively, triumphant affair than the one put on by our illustrious fellow believer and friend, Colonel Veiga, who is an honor to his class and one of the glories of his party . . .”",CO040CL10
2960,334,"“The party in which I will remain until I die,” added the colonel, in a tone of voice that made clear these words were a mere parenthesis.",CO040CL10
2961,335,"Despite having begun by declaring that there was no need to say anything more about the colonel’s many merits, the intrepid orator went on to speak for a good twenty-five minutes, much to the chagrin both of Father Maciel, who had his eye on a seductively quivering bread pudding at the far end of the table, and of the magistrate, who was dying for a cigarette. This memorable discourse concluded more or less like this:",CO040CL10
2962,336,"“I would, however, be neglecting my duties as a friend, fellow believer, subordinate, and admirer if I were not to speak out on this occasion and put into words—rough-and-ready, yes (disapproving murmurs), but sincerely felt—all the emotions that crowd my breast, all the enthusiasm that fills my heart, when I gaze on the venerable, the illustrious Colonel Veiga, and if I were not to invite you now to join me in drinking to his health.”",CO040CL10
2963,337,"The audience enthusiastically joined in the toast, to which the colonel responded with these few, heartfelt words:",CO040CL10
2964,338,"“The praise heaped on me by the distinguished Major Brás is the gift of a large and generous heart; I do not deserve such a gift, ladies and gentlemen, and I return it intact to the illustrious orator himself.”",CO040CL10
2965,339,<null>,CO040CL10
2966,340,"In the midst of the feast and the prevailing gaiety, no one noticed Camilo’s attentions to Dr. Matos’s lovely daughter. No, I lie. Leandro Soares, who had also been invited to the supper, did not once take his eyes off his elegant rival or his beautiful and elusive lady.",CO040CL10
2967,341,"It must seem to the reader a near-miracle that Soares should remain so unmoved and even happy to see his rival’s clear intentions, but it is no miracle. Soares was also studying Isabel’s gaze, and he saw in it only the indifference or even disdain with which she treated the comendador’s son, and he thought to himself:",CO040CL10
2968,342,“She loves neither of us.”,CO040CL10
2969,343,"Camilo was in love, and the following day, he was even more in love; with each day that passed, the consuming flame of passion grew higher. Paris and the princess had vanished from his heart and mind. Only one being and one place merited a space in his thoughts: Isabel and Goiás.",CO040CL10
2970,344,"The young woman’s haughty, scornful demeanor contributed in large measure to this transformation. Considering himself better than his rival, Camilo was thinking:",CO040CL10
2971,345,"“If she cares nothing for me, how much less must she care for Soares. But why is she so offhand with me? Why should I be defeated like any other vulgar suitor?”",CO040CL10
2972,346,"When he thought this, he recalled what the stranger in the church had said to him and told himself:",CO040CL10
2973,347,"“There really must be some mystery behind this, but how to find out what it is?”",CO040CL10
2974,348,"He asked various townspeople if they knew the identity of the short man with the small, bright eyes. No one could help him. It seemed incredible that he could not find the whereabouts of a man who must be known to someone; he redoubled his efforts, but no one could tell him who the mysterious stranger was.",CO040CL10
2975,349,"Meanwhile, he became a frequent visitor to Dr. Matos’s house and occasionally dined there. It was difficult to speak to Isabel with the freedom that more modern manners would allow, and yet he did what he could to communicate his feelings to the beautiful young woman. She, however, seemed to grow more and more impervious to his protestations. She didn’t exactly treat him scornfully, but coldly; she appeared to have a heart of ice.",CO040CL10
2976,350,"Spurned love was joined by wounded pride, resentment, and embarrassment, and all these things, along with an epidemic raging in the area, landed our Camilo in bed, where we will leave him to be cared for by his medical colleagues.",CO040CL10

2978,352,REVELATION,CO040CL10
2979,353,"There are no mysteries for an author who can scrutinize every nook and cranny of the human heart. While the people of Santa Luzia came up with a thousand theories to explain the real reason behind the lovely Isabel’s inability to love, I am in a position to tell the impatient reader that she is perfectly capable of love.",CO040CL10
2980,354,“But who does she love?” asks the reader urgently.,CO040CL10
2981,355,"She loves . . . a flower. A flower? Yes, a flower. It must be a very pretty flower, then, a miracle of perfumed freshness. No, it’s a very ugly flower, dried and withered, a mere corpse of a flower, which must once have been very beautiful, but which now, lying in its little basket, inspires only curiosity.",CO040CL10
2982,356,"Because it really is very odd that a young woman of twenty, when she is at her most passionate, should seem indifferent to the men around her and focus all her affections on the faded, withered remains of a flower.",CO040CL10
2983,357,"Ah, but the flower was picked in very special circumstances. It happened a few years ago. There was a boy who lived locally and who was very fond of Isabel, because she was a delightful creature; he even used to call her his wife, an innocent joke to which time gave the lie. Isabel was equally fond of the boy, so much so that the following idea took root in the mind of the girl’s father:",CO040CL10
2984,358,"“If she still feels the same in a few years’ time, and if he does truly love her, then I think I could well marry them off.”",CO040CL10
2985,359,"Isabel knew nothing of her father’s idea, but she continued to be fond of the boy, and he continued to find her a very interesting creature. One day, Isabel saw a pretty blue flower growing among the branches of a tree.",CO040CL10
2986,360,“What a lovely flower!” she said.,CO040CL10
2987,361,"“I suppose you’d like it, would you?”",CO040CL10
2988,362,"“I would, yes,” said the girl, who, though untutored in these matters, already understood such oblique, disguised ways of speaking.",CO040CL10
2989,363,"He took off his jacket with all the nonchalance of a grown-up in the presence of a child and climbed the tree. Isabel waited below, tense and eager to have the flower. The obliging boy soon reached the flower and delicately plucked it.",CO040CL10
2990,364,“Catch!” he said from up above.,CO040CL10
2991,365,"Isabel went closer to the tree and held out her skirts to catch the flower. Pleased to have granted the girl’s wish, the boy began to descend, but so clumsily that, only two minutes later, he was lying on the ground at Isabel’s feet.",CO040CL10
2992,366,"She gave a terrified cry and called for help; the boy tried to calm her, saying it was nothing, and trying to clamber cheerfully to his feet. He did eventually manage to stand up, but his shirt was spattered with blood, for he had cut his head.",CO040CL10
2993,367,"The wound was declared to be only superficial, and, after a few days, the brave boy had completely recovered.",CO040CL10
2994,368,"The incident made a deep impression on Isabel. Up until then, she had merely been fond of the boy; thenceforth, she adored him. The flower he had picked inevitably withered, but Isabel kept it as if it were a relic, kissing it every day and, later on, even shedding tears over it. A kind of superstitious cult bound her heart to that shriveled flower.",CO040CL10
2995,369,"However, she was not so callous that she did not feel deeply concerned when she learned that Camilo was ill. She asked assiduously after his health and, five days later, went with her father to visit him.",CO040CL10
2996,370,"While the mere fact of her visit did not cure the patient, it did console and encourage him; a few faint hopes sprang up in him, hopes that had grown as dried and withered as the flower of the story.",CO040CL10
2997,371,"“Perhaps now she will love me,” he thought.",CO040CL10
2998,372,"As soon as he was more or less restored to health, his first act was to go to Dr. Matos’s house, and his father offered to go with him. Dr. Matos was not at home, only his sister and daughter. The sister was a poor old lady, who, as well as suffering the usual afflictions of old age, had two further afflictions, namely, deafness and a love of politics.",CO040CL10
2999,373,"The occasion proved propitious; while Isabel’s aunt monopolized the comendador’s person and attention, Camilo had time to deliver a quick, decisive blow, addressing these words to the young woman:",CO040CL10
3000,374,“I wanted to thank you for your kindness and concern while I was ill. That same kindness gives me the courage to ask you one other thing.”,CO040CL10
3001,375,Isabel frowned.,CO040CL10
3002,376,"“A few days ago, a hope I had long thought dead and buried suddenly revived,” Camilo went on. “Was that a mere illusion? A single word, a single gesture from you would resolve that doubt.”",CO040CL10
3003,377,Isabel shrugged.,CO040CL10
3004,378,"“I don’t understand,” she said.",CO040CL10
3005,379,"“Yes, you do,” said Camilo somewhat bitterly. “But, if you insist, I’ll put it plainly. I love you. I’ve told you so a thousand times, but you always ignore me. Now, though—”",CO040CL10
3006,380,"Camilo would have happily ended this brief speech there and then, if he’d had before him the person he had hoped would be listening to him. Isabel, however, did not even give him time to finish. Without a word or gesture, she walked the entire length of the veranda and went and sat at the far end, where her old aunt was testing the comendador’s excellent lungs to the limit.",CO040CL10
3007,381,"Camilo’s disappointment was beyond description. Complaining of a nonexistent heat, he left the house to get some fresh air, and, now slowly, now quickly, depending on which emotion dominated, whether irritation or despair, he, the wretched suitor, wandered off.",CO040CL10
3008,382,"He invented endless plans for revenge and endless ways of throwing himself at her feet; he recalled all their previous encounters, and, after a very long hour, he reached the sad conclusion that all was lost.",CO040CL10
3009,383,"At this point, he realized that he was standing beside a stream that crossed Dr. Matos’s farm. It was a rather desolate place and perfectly suited to the situation in which he found himself. Two hundred paces away, he saw a cabin, where he thought he could hear someone singing a song from the sertão.",CO040CL10
3010,384,"Another person’s happiness is always a tiresome thing when one has oneself suffered some misfortune! Camilo felt even more irritated, and ingenuously wondered how anyone could possibly be happy when his own despairing heart was bleeding.",CO040CL10
3011,385,"Then a man appeared at the cabin door and walked over to the stream. A shiver ran through Camilo, for he seemed to recognize in him the mysterious stranger who had spoken to him in the church. He was the same stature and had the same air about him; Camilo walked rapidly over to him and stopped a few feet away. The man turned around: it was him! Camilo ran up to him.",CO040CL10
3012,386,“At last!” he said.,CO040CL10
3013,387,The stranger smiled smugly and shook Camilo’s proffered hand.,CO040CL10
3014,388,“Do you need to sit down?” he asked.,CO040CL10
3015,389,"“No,” said Camilo. “I don’t mind where we talk, it can be here or somewhere else if you like, but, please, explain what you said to me the other day in the church.”",CO040CL10
3016,390,The stranger smiled again.,CO040CL10
3017,391,"“So?” said Camilo, seeing that the man did not answer.",CO040CL10
3018,392,"“First of all, tell me honestly: do you really love her?”",CO040CL10
3019,393,"“Oh, yes, very much.”",CO040CL10
3020,394,“Do you swear that you will make her happy?”,CO040CL10
3021,395,“I swear.”,CO040CL10
3022,396,"“Then, listen. What I’m about to tell you is true, because I heard it from my wife, who was Dona Isabel’s wet nurse. That’s her over there.”",CO040CL10
3023,397,"Camilo glanced back at the cabin door and saw a tall, elegant mulatto woman eyeing him curiously.",CO040CL10
3024,398,"“Let’s move a little farther off so that she can’t hear us,” said the stranger, “because I don’t want her to know who you heard this story from.”",CO040CL10
3025,399,"And they did move away, walking along beside the stream. The stranger then told Camilo the story of the flower and the cult the young woman had built up around it. A less canny reader will imagine that Camilo listened to this story feeling sad and downcast. However, a more experienced reader will have guessed at once that the stranger’s revelation made Camilo’s soul turn somersaults of joy.",CO040CL10
3026,400,"“So that’s how it is,” said the stranger in conclusion. “You now know where you stand.”",CO040CL10
3027,401,"“Oh, yes, I do, I do!” cried Camilo. “I am loved! I am loved!”",CO040CL10
3028,402,"Once he knew the story, Camilo could not wait to go back to the house he had left some time before. He put his hand in his pocket, opened his wallet, and took out a twenty-mil-réis note.",CO040CL10
3029,403,"“You have done me an enormous service,” he said, “one that is beyond price. Please accept this small token of my appreciation.”",CO040CL10
3030,404,"And he handed the money to the man. The stranger gave a scornful laugh and, at first, said nothing. Then he took the note Camilo was offering and, to the latter’s great astonishment, threw it into the stream. The thread of water, which ran burbling and leaping over the pebbles, carried off the note, along with a leaf that the wind also carried off with it.",CO040CL10
3031,405,"“That way,” said the stranger, “you don’t owe me a favor and I receive no payment for it. Please don’t think my intention was to serve you; it wasn’t. I simply wanted to make the daughter of my benefactor happy. I knew that she had been in love with a boy, and that he would be able to make her happy; I merely opened up the way that would lead him to her. That is not something you pay for, your gratitude is enough.”",CO040CL10
3032,406,"Having said these words, the stranger returned to the cabin.",CO040CL10
3033,407,"Camilo watched the rustic fellow walk away, and, shortly afterward, he was back at Isabel’s house, where his return was awaited with some anxiety. Indeed, Isabel’s face lit up with joy when she saw him.",CO040CL10
3034,408,"“I know everything,” Camilo said to her shortly before he left to go home.",CO040CL10
3035,409,She stared at him in amazement.,CO040CL10
3036,410,“Everything?” she said.,CO040CL10
3037,411,"“I know that you love me, and I know that your love began many years ago, when you were a child, and that even now—”",CO040CL10
3038,412,"He was interrupted by his father coming over to join them. Isabel looked pale and confused, and was grateful for this interruption, because she had no idea how to respond.",CO040CL10
3039,413,"The following day, Camilo wrote her a passionate letter, invoking the love she had kept hidden in her heart, and asking her to make him happy. He waited two whole days for a reply. It came on the third day, and was short and to the point. She admitted that she had indeed loved him for all those years and had sworn never to love anyone else.",CO040CL10
3040,414,"“That is all,” concluded Isabel. “As for becoming your wife, that can never be. I want to give my life to someone whose love is equal to mine. Your love began yesterday, mine nine years ago; the difference in age is too great; ours could never be a good marriage. Forget about me. Farewell.”",CO040CL10
3041,415,To say that this letter only increased Camilo’s love would be to set down in writing what the reader has already guessed. Camilo’s heart needed only a written confession from her to push him over the edge into madness. Her letter made him take leave of his senses.,CO040CL10

3045,419,"Camilo greeted his father’s plan with a shrug, determined to accept no proposals apart from that of marrying Isabel. The comendador, Father Maciel and the colonel all tried in vain to tempt him with a glittering future and the prospect of lofty government posts. However, the only post that interested him was marriage to Isabel.",CO040CL10
3046,420,"This, of course, was not easy. Isabel’s resolve appeared to be unshakable.",CO040CL10
3047,421,"“But she does love me,” he thought, “and that’s half the battle.”",CO040CL10
3048,422,"And since his love was more recent than hers, Camilo realized that the only way to solve the problem of that age difference was to show her that his love was more passionate and capable of still greater sacrifices.",CO040CL10
3049,423,"He stopped at nothing to prove this. He braved wind and rain to visit her every day; he was a slave to her every desire, however small. If Isabel had expressed the childish wish to hold the morning star in her hand, he would very likely have found a way to bring it to her. At the same time, he had stopped pestering her with letters and declarations of love. In his last letter, he said only:",CO040CL10
3050,424,“I will live in hope!”,CO040CL10
3051,425,"This hope had to sustain him for many weeks, and still he saw no real improvement in his situation.",CO040CL10
3052,426,"Some less demanding reader may find Isabel’s resolve odd, especially now that she knew her love was requited. I agree, but I do not wish to alter the character of my heroine, because she was exactly as I describe her in these pages. She felt that the fact that she was loved was pure chance, simply because the young man had happened to return from Paris, whereas she had spent long years thinking of him and living solely on that memory; she clearly found this thought humiliating, and because she was extremely proud, she had resolved not to marry him or anyone else. Absurd, maybe, but that is how it was.",CO040CL10
3053,427,"Weary with vainly laying siege to the young woman’s heart, and convinced, on the other hand, that if he were ever to break her resolve, he had to demonstrate that his was an invincible passion, Camilo drew up a master plan.",CO040CL10
3054,428,"One morning, he vanished from the farm. At first no one was concerned about his absence, because he often went for long walks when he woke earlier than usual. As time passed, though, they began to grow worried. Emissaries were sent out, but they returned with nothing to report.",CO040CL10
3055,429,"His father was distraught, and news of his disappearance spread everywhere for ten leagues around.",CO040CL10
3056,430,"After five days of fruitless searching, they learned that a young man fitting Camilo’s description had been spotted half a league away, on horseback. He was alone and seemed very sad. A muleteer stated that he had seen a young man standing beside a river, as if assessing the likelihood of death were he to jump.",CO040CL10
3057,431,"The comendador began offering large sums of money as a reward for anyone who brought him news of his son. His friends dispatched their servants to scour forests and fields, and a whole week passed with nothing to justify these useless labors.",CO040CL10
3058,432,"Need I describe the lovely Isabel’s anguish when she was told of Camilo’s disappearance? At first sight, she seemed unmoved; her face revealed nothing of the storm that immediately broke in her heart. Ten minutes later, the storm had risen to her eyes and burst forth in a veritable sea of tears.",CO040CL10
3059,433,"It was then that her father learned of that long-incubated passion. Seeing that explosion of grief, he feared that her love could prove fatal to her. His first thought was that the young man had disappeared in order to flee a forced marriage. Isabel reassured him, saying that, on the contrary, she had been the one to reject Camilo’s love.",CO040CL10
3060,434,“I killed him!” she cried.,CO040CL10
3061,435,"Her kindly father found it hard to understand why a young woman in love with a young man, and a young man in love with a young woman, should do their best to remain apart, instead of heading straight for the altar, as he had done when he first fell in love.",CO040CL10

3065,439,“Safe!” exclaimed both father and daughter.,CO040CL10
3066,440,"“It’s true,” said Miguel (for that was the man’s name). “I found him yesterday evening lying in a stream, almost drowned.”",CO040CL10
3067,441,“Why did you not come and tell us?” asked Dr. Matos.,CO040CL10
3068,442,"“Because I needed to take care of him first. When he came to, all he wanted was to make another attempt to end his life, but my wife and I stopped him. He’s still a little weak, which is why he didn’t come with me now.”",CO040CL10
3069,443,"Isabel’s face was radiant. A few silent tears still filled her eyes, but they were tears of joy, not sorrow.",CO040CL10
3070,444,Miguel left with the promise that Dr. Matos would come and fetch Camilo.,CO040CL10
3071,445,"“Now, Isabel,” said her father, as soon as he was alone with her, “what do you intend to do?”",CO040CL10
3072,446,"“I’ll do whatever you say, Father!”",CO040CL10
3073,447,“I will only tell you to do what your heart tells you to do. What does your heart say?”,CO040CL10
3074,448,“It says . . .”,CO040CL10

3076,450,“It says yes.”,CO040CL10
3077,451,"“Which is what it should have said a long time ago, because . . .”",CO040CL10
3078,452,He stopped and thought:,CO040CL10
3079,453,“What if there’s another reason behind this attempted suicide? I must find that out.”,CO040CL10
3080,454,"When the comendador was informed of what had happened, he went straight to Dr. Matos’s house, where Camilo soon joined them. Written on the poor lad’s face was the shock of having escaped the tragic death he himself had sought; that, at least, is what he repeatedly told Isabel’s father on their way back to his house.",CO040CL10
3081,455,“But why were you so determined to kill yourself?” asked Dr. Matos.,CO040CL10
3082,456,"“Well . . .” said Camilo, who had been expecting this question. “I hardly dare say.”",CO040CL10
3083,457,"“Is it something to be ashamed of?” asked Dr. Matos, smiling benevolently.",CO040CL10
3084,458,"“No, not at all.”",CO040CL10
3085,459,“So what was the reason?”,CO040CL10
3086,460,“Will you forgive me if I tell you?”,CO040CL10
3087,461,“Of course.”,CO040CL10
3088,462,"“No, I daren’t say,” said Camilo resolutely.",CO040CL10
3089,463,"“Look, there’s no point in lying. I know already.”",CO040CL10
3090,464,“Oh!”,CO040CL10
3091,465,"“And I forgive your reasons for doing it, but not the act itself; that was pure childishness.”",CO040CL10
3092,466,“But she despises me!”,CO040CL10
3093,467,"“No, she doesn’t. She loves you!”",CO040CL10
3094,468,"Camilo gave a perfect imitation of someone taken completely by surprise, and accompanied the doctor back to his house, where he also found his father, who was uncertain whether to be stern with his son or as pleased as punch.",CO040CL10
3095,469,Camilo saw at once the effect his near-suicide had had on Isabel’s heart.,CO040CL10
3096,470,"“Right,” said her father, “now that we’ve resurrected you, we need to attach you firmly to life with a good strong chain.”",CO040CL10
3097,471,"And without any of the usual formalities and ignoring all the usual niceties, he announced to the comendador that their respective children must marry at once.",CO040CL10
3098,472,"The comendador had not yet recovered from the news that his son had been found, and when he heard this, he could not have been more astonished had the whole Xavante tribe hurled themselves upon him armed with bows and arrows. He kept looking around at everyone present as if wanting to know the reason for something that required no explanation at all.",CO040CL10
3099,473,"Finally, he was told about the love between Camilo and Isabel, the sole cause of his son’s attempted suicide. The comendador approved of his son’s choice, and took gallantry so far as to say that, in the circumstances, he would have done just the same had the young lady spurned his love.",CO040CL10
3100,474,“Am I at last worthy of your love?” Camilo asked Isabel when he found himself alone with her.,CO040CL10
3101,475,"“Of course!” she said. “If you had died, I would have died too!”",CO040CL10
3102,476,"Camilo quickly added that Providence had been watching over him, although it was never quite clear what he meant by Providence. It was not long before news of the outcome of this tragic episode had spread throughout the town and its environs.",CO040CL10
3103,477,"The announcement of Camilo and Isabel’s forthcoming marriage drove Leandro Soares almost to the brink of madness. A thousand acts of vengeance rushed into his mind, each bloodier than the last; in his opinion, they were both vile traitors, and he must exact a solemn revenge on them.",CO040CL10
3104,478,"No despot could ever have imagined more hideous torments than those dreamed up by Leandro Soares’s overheated imagination. The poor lover spent a whole two days and nights in pointless conjectures. On the third day, he decided to seek out his fortunate rival, throw his villainy in his face, and then kill him.",CO040CL10
3105,479,He armed himself with a knife and set off.,CO040CL10
3106,480,"The happy bridegroom-to-be was leaving his house, unaware of the fate awaiting him, and imagining a life brimming with happiness and celestial delights. The thought of Isabel painted everything around him in a poetic rosy glow. He was completely immersed in these daydreams when he saw before him his former rival. Absorbed as he was in his own happiness, he had forgotten all about him, but he immediately grasped the danger he was in and prepared to face it.",CO040CL10
3107,481,"Faithful to his self-imposed plan, Leandro Soares unleashed a litany of insults that Camilo listened to in silence. When Soares had finished and was about to put into practice the bloody conclusion, Camilo said:",CO040CL10
3108,482,"“I’ve listened to everything you’ve said, and I ask you now to listen to me. Yes, it’s true that I’m going to marry Isabel, but it’s also true that she doesn’t love you. What, then, is our crime? Now, while you have been thinking only hateful thoughts about me, I have been thinking of your happiness.”",CO040CL10
3109,483,"“Oh, have you?” said Soares with heavy irony.",CO040CL10
3110,484,"“It’s true. I said to myself that a man of your talents should not be eternally condemned to act as a stepping-stone for the ambitions of other men; and then, when my father wanted to force me to become provincial deputy, I told him that I would accept the post only in order to give it to you. My father agreed, but there was still a certain amount of political resistance to overcome and, even now, I still have some way to go. A man who would do that for you does, I think, deserve a little gratitude, or at least a little less hatred.”",CO040CL10
3111,485,"There are not, I believe, strong enough words in the human language to describe the look of indignation on Leandro Soares’s face. He flushed bright scarlet, and his eyes seemed to spit fire. His lips trembled as if they were quietly rehearsing a sufficiently eloquent insult to hurl at his fortunate rival. Finally, he managed to say:",CO040CL10
3112,486,“What you have done was quite villainous enough without stooping to mockery—”,CO040CL10
3113,487,"“Mockery!” cried Camilo, interrupting him.",CO040CL10
3114,488,"“What else would you call what you have just said? Gratitude indeed, when, after robbing me of my greatest, my only happiness, you offer me politics as some kind of compensation!”",CO040CL10
3115,489,Camilo managed to explain that it wasn’t a matter of compensation; he had come up with the plan because he knew of Soares’s political interests and thought that this would please him.,CO040CL10
3116,490,"“At the same time,” he said gravely, “I also wanted to do a good service to the province, because, even if it cost me my life, I would never do anything that might prove detrimental to my province and my country. I was hoping to serve both province and country by putting you forward as a candidate, and I know that everyone would agree with me on that.”",CO040CL10
3117,491,"“But you mentioned some resistance,” said Soares, fixing his adversary with an inquisitorial eye.",CO040CL10
3118,492,"“Yes, but for purely political reasons, not because they’re opposed to you personally,” explained Camilo. “And what does that matter? Reason will prevail, as will the true principles of the party that has the honor of counting you among its members.”",CO040CL10
3119,493,"Leandro Soares did not for a moment take his eyes off Camilo; an ironic, threatening smile played upon his lips. He studied him for a few seconds without saying a word, then again broke his silence.",CO040CL10
3120,494,"“What would you do in my place?” he asked, and his ironic smile took on a truly menacing air.",CO040CL10
3121,495,"“I would refuse,” said Camilo fearlessly.",CO040CL10
3122,496,“Ah!”,CO040CL10
3123,497,"“Yes, I would refuse, because I have no political vocation. That’s not the case with you, though, for you do have such a vocation, as well as the support of the party throughout the province.”",CO040CL10
3124,498,"“Yes, so I believe,” said Soares proudly.",CO040CL10
3125,499,"“And you’re not alone in believing that, everyone says the same.”",CO040CL10
3126,500,"Soares began pacing up and down. Was his mind filled with a tumult of terrible thoughts or was a glimmer of humanity demanding moderation in the kind of death he dealt his rival? Five whole minutes passed. Then Soares stopped pacing, stood face-to-face with Camilo, and asked bluntly:",CO040CL10
3127,501,“Will you swear one thing?”,CO040CL10
3128,502,“What’s that?”,CO040CL10
3129,503,“That you will make her happy.”,CO040CL10
3130,504,"“I’ve already sworn as much to myself, and it will be my sweet duty to do so.”",CO040CL10
3131,505,"“It would have been my duty, too, had fate not turned against me. No matter, I’m ready to do whatever is necessary.”",CO040CL10
3132,506,"“And I know what a generous heart you have,” said Camilo, holding out his hand to him.",CO040CL10
3133,507,"“Possibly, but what you do not know, what you cannot know, is the storm raging in my soul, the terrible pain that will go with me to the grave. A love such as mine will never die.”",CO040CL10
3134,508,"He paused and shook his head, as if to drive away some baleful idea.",CO040CL10
3135,509,“What are you thinking?” asked Camilo.,CO040CL10
3136,510,"“Don’t worry,” Leandro replied, “I’m not hatching any plots. I will resign myself to fate, and if I do accept the political candidacy you’re offering, it is only so as to drown in it the grief filling my heart.”",CO040CL10
3137,511,"I’m not sure that this electoral remedy would cure every lover’s complaint, but in Soares’s heart it provoked a healthy crisis, which resolved itself in the patient’s favor.",CO040CL10
3138,512,"Readers will already have guessed that Camilo had not, in fact, spoken up for Soares, but he immediately set about doing just that, as did his father, and he finally managed to have Leandro Soares included on the list of candidates to be presented to the electorate at the next campaign. Soares’s opponents, knowing the circumstances in which he had been offered the candidacy, took delight in repeating that he had sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.",CO040CL10
3139,513,"Camilo had been married for a year when a French traveler came to his door. He brought with him letters of recommendation from one of his former teachers in Paris.

My soul flew through space until it lost sight of the Earth, leaving the moon, the stars and the sun far below. It finally penetrated a place where there was nothing, and it was barely lighted by a diffuse light. I continued to rise, and I started to see a brighter dot far, far away.

So that was the reason for the extraordinary celebrations they had for me, and which lasted two centuries, or, by our calendar, forty-eight hours. Finally, when the festivities concluded, they invited me to return to Earth for a new life. It was the privilege of every soul that completed a million. I responded by thanking them and refusing, but there was no refusing. It was an eternal law. The only freedom they gave me was the choice of the vehicle. I could be born a prince or a bus driver.

Frankly, I had a boring childhood, and school was no better. They called me foolish and lazy. Actually, I lived fleeing everything.",CO140CL07
3170,24,"Believe me, during this time I didn’t slip, but I never ran. My word, it was a time of hassle, and comparing the broken heads of another time with the boredom of today, better the broken heads. I grew up, became a young man, and entered the time of lovers . . . Do not be alarmed, I will be chaste, like the first supper. Your Excellency knows what a supper of men and women is?”",CO140CL07
3171,25,“How would I know? . . . ”,CO140CL07
3172,26,"“I was nineteen years old,” José Maria continued, “and you can’t imagine the amazement of my friends when I declared myself ready to go to such a supper . . . Nobody expected such a thing from such a cautious guy who fled from everything, from postponed naps, from excessive naps, who walked alone in the dead hours of night, who lived, so to speak, groping around.",CO140CL07
3173,27,"I went to the supper; it was in the Botanical Garden, a splendid place. Food, wine, lights, flowers, the joy of the boys, the eyes of the ladies, and, above all, an appetite of twenty years. Would you believe I ate nothing? The memory of three stomach aches caught forty years before, in my first life, made me recoil. I lied, saying I wasn’t well. One of the ladies came and sat on my right, to heal me, and another also got up and came to my left with the same purpose. ‘You heal one side, I’ll heal the other,’ they said.",CO140CL07
3174,28,"They were happy, fresh, clever, and had a reputation for devouring the hearts and lives of young men. I confess I got scared and withdrew. They did everything, everything, but in vain. I came away from there in the morning in love with both, without either, and falling from hunger. What do you think?” concluded José Maria putting his hands on his knees and arching his arms out.",CO140CL07

He continued to wave his arms, standing in front of the priest and saying that that’s what it was, a bird, a large bird . . . Each time he hit his arms on his thighs he raised his heels, giving the body a cadence of movements and keeping both feet together, to show that they were tied.",CO140CL07
3180,34,"Monsignor approved with a nod while sharpening his ears to see if he heard footsteps on the stairs. Everything was in silence. He only heard the muffled sounds coming from outside – cars and carts coming down the street, greengrocers hawking vegetables, and a neighborhood piano. José Maria sat down, finally, after picking up his cane, and continued with these words:",CO140CL07

She is the daughter of an emeritus professor.",CO140CL07

Eyes, handshakes, loose words, other connections, a sentence, two sentences, and we were in love and we announced it. One night, on the stairway, we exchanged our first kiss . . . Forgive these things, Monsignor; pretend you are listening to me for confession. I tell you this only to add that I came away dizzy, delirious, with the image of Clemência in my head and the taste of her kisses in my mouth.",CO140CL07
3186,40,"I wandered around lost for about two hours, planning a unique life, determined to ask her hand at the end of the week, and then be married in a month. I got down to the very last details, carefully wrote and adorned the letters to her in my head. I got home after midnight and all this phantasmagoria flew away, like the changes in set that could be seen in the old theater plays. See if you can guess how.”",CO140CL07

I completed my toilette, lit a cigarette, and, reclining on the sofa, I thought how the usual custom, coexistence, could save everything. But soon after I warned myself that our two characters could be incompatible; and what to do with two incompatible and inseparable characters? But anyway, I ignored it because the passion was great, violent; I imagined myself married, with a beautiful baby . . .",CO140CL07

A crisis could also come, two crises, lack of money, hardship, disease, any of these spurious affections disturbing domestic peace could come . . .

Let me smoke another cigarette?”",CO140CL07
3190,44,"He did not wait for an answer. He rolled his cigarette and lit it. The Monsignor could not help admiring his beautiful head amid the disarray of his state. At the same time he noted that he spoke in polite terms and, despite his morbid outbursts, he had manners. Who the hell could this man be?",CO140CL07
3191,45,"José Maria continued the story, saying he stopped going to Clemência’s house for six days, but he did not resist the letters and tears. At the end of a week, he ran there and confessed it all, everything. She listened to him with much interest and wondered what it would take to end so much brooding, what proof of love he wanted her to give him. Jose Maria’s response was a question.",CO140CL07
3192,46,“Are you willing to do me a great sacrifice?” I told her.,CO140CL07
3193,47,"Clemência swore she was. ""Well, break away from everything, family and society; come and live with me, we’ll get married after this experiment.” I can see Your Excellency’s eyes bulging.

3197,51,"“I kissed her feet, kissed the heels of her shoes. You can not imagine my contentment. The next day, I received a letter bordered in black. It was the news of the death of an uncle of mine, in the town of Santana do Livramento, leaving me twenty thousand contos. I was thunderstruck.",CO140CL07
3198,52,"‘I understand,’ I said to Clemência. ‘You sacrificed everything because you had the news of the inheritance.’ This time Clemência did not weep. She pulled herself together and went out. I went after her, embarrassed, asked for her forgiveness. She resisted. One day, two days, three days, it was all in vain; Clemência did not give up anything; she was not even talking. So I declared to her that I would kill myself, bought a revolver, went to her and showed it to her. This is it.”",CO140CL07

We arranged to move up the date of our marriage, and, for my part, I imposed a condition: to donate the twenty thousand contos to the National Library.

3202,56,"And in a jump Jose Maria was standing again, waving his arms and giving his body a cadence. Monsignor Caldas began to sweat cold. After a few seconds, José Maria stopped, sat down, and resumed his narration, now more diffuse, spilling forth, and evidently more delusional. He told of the fear in which he lived, his dislikes and distrusts. He could not bring a fig to his teeth. As before, the fear of a worm took away its taste.",CO140CL07
3203,57,"He did not believe the happy faces of people going down the street: concerns, desires, hatred, sadness, and other things were concealed by about three quarters of them. He lived in fear of a son who was blind or deaf and dumb, or tuberculous, or a murderer, etc. He could not give a dinner without becoming sad right after the soup, for the idea that a word of his, a little gesture of his wife, any shortcoming in the service, could cause the digestive epigram out on the street, under a streetlamp.",CO140CL07
3204,58,"The experience gave him the terror of being cheated. He confessed to the priest that, really, until now he had not profited anything by it; but instead, he had lost, because he was taken by violence. In the previous evening, he had gone to bed earlier and dreamed . . . Whom did the priest think he dreamed of?",CO140CL07

Getting to the point where Jesus speaks of the lilies in the fields, the Devil picked some and gave them to us. ‘Here,’ he told me, ‘these are the lilies of the Scripture; as you heard it, not even Solomon in all his pomp could rub shoulders with them. Solomon is wisdom. And do you know what these lilies are, José? They are your twenties.’ I stared at them enthralled; you can not imagine how beautiful they were.",CO140CL07
3207,61,"The Devil took them, smelled them and told me to do so, too. I won’t tell you anything; at the moment I got them near my nose I saw a reeking, filthy reptile coming out. I cried out and flung the flowers away. Then the Devil let out a formidable guffaw: ‘Jose Maria, these are your twenties.’ It was a laugh like this: - ká, ká, ká, ká, ká, ká…”",CO140CL07
3208,62,"José Maria laughed loosely, shrilly, diabolically. Suddenly he stopped, stood up, and said that as soon as he opened his eyes, he saw his wife before him, very distraught and disheveled. Clemência's eyes were sweet, but he told her that even sweet eyes do harm. She threw herself at his feet . . .",CO140CL07
3209,63,"At this point the face of José Maria was so upset that the priest, also standing, began to retreat, trembling and pale. ""No, wretch, no! Thou shalt not flee from me!""

3212,3,“Would you excuse me? I’ll just be a moment.”,CO140CL10

3214,5,"“João, go down to the police station, speak to the commander on my behalf, and ask him to come here with one or two men, to take a madman off my hands. Go on, hurry.”",CO140CL10
3215,6,"And, returning to the parlor:",CO140CL10
3216,7,"“Right,” he said, “where were we?”",CO140CL10
3217,8,"“As I was saying, Reverend, I died on March 20, 1860, at forty-three minutes past five in the morning. I was sixty-eight years of age. My soul soared through space until it had lost sight of the Earth and left the moon, stars, and sun far behind. Finally, it entered a space where there was nothing at all, just a diffuse glow. I continued to soar ever higher, and began to see a brighter spot far, far in the distance. The spot grew and became a sun. I entered it, without getting burned, because souls are incombustible. Has yours ever caught fire?”",CO140CL10
3218,9,"“No, it hasn’t.”",CO140CL10
3219,10,"“Well, that’s because souls are incombustible. I carried on upward; when I was forty thousand leagues off, I heard delightful music, and as soon as I reached five thousand leagues, a swarm of souls descended and bore me aloft on a palanquin of ether and feathers. Shortly afterward, I entered the new sun, which is the planet of the virtuous souls of the Earth. I am no poet, Monsignor, and I dare not describe to you the magnificence of that heavenly abode. Even if I were a poet, the language of mere humans would not suffice to convey the feeling of grandeur, bedazzlement, and joy, the rapturous melodies, the shimmering lights and colors, a thing both indefinable and incomprehensible.",CO140CL10
3220,11,"It has to be seen to be believed. Once inside, I discovered that my arrival completed another set of one thousand souls; this was the reason for the extraordinary celebrations they laid on for me, and which lasted for two centuries, or, by our reckoning, forty-eight hours. When the festivities were finally over, they invited me to return to Earth to take on a new life; it was a privilege granted to each thousandth soul. I thanked them, but refused; however, refusal was not permitted. It was an eternal law. The only liberty they allowed me was my choice of vehicle; I could be reborn either as a prince or a bus conductor. What was I to do? What would you have done in my shoes?”",CO140CL10
3221,12,“I couldn’t possibly say; it would all depend . . .”,CO140CL10
3222,13,"“Quite right; it all depends on the circumstances. But imagine that my circumstances were such that it gave me no pleasure to return to this world. I was the victim of inexperience, Monsignor, and, for that very reason, I had a terrible old age. Then I remembered what I had always heard my father and other old people saying when they saw some young man:",CO140CL10
3223,14,"“Oh, to be that age again, knowing what I know now!” With this in mind, I announced that I cared not a jot whether I was born a beggar or a prince, as long as I was born with experience. You can scarcely imagine the universal laughter this provoked.",CO140CL10
3224,15,"Job, who presides over the province of patient souls up there, told me that such a wish was sheer nonsense; but I insisted and I got my way. Shortly afterward, I slipped back through space; I spent nine months traversing the void until I plumped down into the arms of a nursemaid, and was named José Maria. Your name’s Romualdo, isn’t it?”",CO140CL10
3225,16,"“Yes, it is. Romualdo de Sousa Caldas.”",CO140CL10

3228,19,"“He’s a fine poet, Father Caldas. Poetry is a gift; I myself could never compose so much as a sonnet. But let’s cut to the chase. First I’ll tell you what happened to me, then I’ll tell you what I would like from you, Reverend. Meanwhile, do you mind, if I smoke . . . ?”",CO140CL10
3229,20,"Monsignor made a gesture of assent, without losing sight of the cane lying on José Maria’s lap. José Maria slowly rolled a cigarette. He was in his early thirties, rather pale, and with a gaze that, at times, was dim and dull, and, at others, bright and restless. He’d appeared just after the priest had finished lunch, and asked to speak to him on a grave and urgent matter. The monsignor asked him to come in and sit down; within ten minutes he could tell that the man was a lunatic.",CO140CL10
3230,21,"He could excuse the incoherence of his ideas and his astonishing imagination; indeed, they might even provide him with a useful case study. But the stranger seemed very angry, and this put the fear of God into the peaceable cleric. What could he and his equally elderly manservant do to defend themselves against a strong man who had clearly lost his mind? While waiting for the police to arrive, Monsignor Caldas was all smiles and nods, playing along with whatever emotion the man expressed, be it astonishment, dread, or joy—a useful policy with lunatics, women, and princes.",CO140CL10
3231,22,"José Maria finally lit his cigarette, and continued:",CO140CL10
3232,23,"“I was reborn on January 5, 1861. I’ll spare you the details of my second childhood, because, at that stage, experience was purely instinctive. I suckled very sparingly and cried as little as I could so as not to be smacked. I began to walk rather late, for fear of falling, leaving me with a certain weakness in the legs. Running and tumbling, climbing trees, jumping over walls, trading blows, all of which have their uses, were things I steered well clear of, for fear of bruises and bleeding. To put it frankly, I had a dull childhood, and school was no different. They said I was foolish and lazy. In fact, I was simply avoiding everything.",CO140CL10
3233,24,"During all that time I don’t believe I ever once slipped and fell, but then I never ran, either. I swear to God, Reverend, it was a terrible time, and, when I compare the bumps and bruises of my former life with the tedium of this one, I’d rather have the bumps and bruises. I grew up; I became a young man and entered the usual romantic phase . . . Don’t be shocked, Reverend; I will be chaste, just like the first supper I attended. Do you know what a supper with young men and easy women is like, Reverend?”",CO140CL10
3234,25,“How could I possibly know that?”,CO140CL10
3235,26,"“I was nineteen years old,” José Maria went on, “and you can’t imagine my friends’ surprise when I announced that I was ready to go to such a supper. No one expected a thing like that from a cautious young man like myself, who balked at everything, whether it was going to bed late, oversleeping, or wandering alone in the dead of night, and who lived, so to speak, by feeling his way cautiously forward in the dark. Anyway, I went to the supper; it was held at the Jardim Botânico and was a splendid occasion.",CO140CL10
3236,27,"Food, wine, candles, flowers, the young men’s high spirits, the ladies’ eyes, and, above all, the appetite of a twenty-year-old. Would you believe it? I didn’t eat a thing. The memory of three bouts of indigestion forty years earlier, during my first life, made me hold back. I lied, saying I was indisposed. One of the ladies came and sat on my right, to cure me; another also got up and came and sat on my left, with the same objective. ‘You cure from one side and I’ll cure from the other,’ they said.",CO140CL10
3237,28,"They were jolly, vivacious, and wily, with a reputation for devouring young men’s hearts and souls. I confess that I took fright and recoiled. They did everything, absolutely everything, but all in vain. I left in the morning, in love with both of them, but with neither of them on my arm, and almost faint with hunger. What do you make of that?” concluded José Maria, putting his hands on his knees, with his elbows sticking out.",CO140CL10

He continued flapping his arms as he stood facing the priest and saying, yes, that was exactly what he was, a bird, a great big bird. Each time his arms struck his thighs, he raised himself up on his heels, giving his body a rhythmic movement, his feet together, to show that they were tied.",CO140CL10
3243,34,"Monsignor nodded approvingly, at the same time straining his ears for the sound of footsteps on the stairs. Only silence. All he could hear were the noises from outside: buggies and carriages coming down the street, barrow boys hawking their wares, and a piano somewhere nearby. Finally, José Maria sat down again, after picking up his cane, and continued as follows:",CO140CL10
3244,35,"“A bird, a great big bird. The adventure that brings me here will suffice to show just what a felicitous comparison that is. It was a matter of conscience, a passion, a woman: a widow by the name of Dona Clemência.

She is the daughter of a retired professor.",CO140CL10

That’s the very nub of the matter We’re both free, we love each other, and we aren’t getting married: such is the murky situation I have come to lay before you, Reverend, so that your theology, or whatever you want to call it, may explain it, if it can. We returned to Rio as sweethearts.",CO140CL10
3248,39,"Clemência was living with her elderly father, and with a brother who worked in commerce; I made the acquaintance of both men, and began to visit their house, on Rua de Matacavalos. Furtive glances, clasped hands, a word here, another there, then a sentence, two sentences, and before you know it we were lovers. One night, on the staircase landing, we exchanged our first kiss. Please excuse such lapses, Monsignor, and pretend that you’re hearing my confession. I wouldn’t even mention such matters if it weren’t to explain how I left that place dazed and bewildered, with a vision of Clemência in my head and the taste of her kiss on my lips.",CO140CL10
3249,40,"I wandered about for nearly two hours, planning a life without equal; I decided to ask for her hand at the end of the week, and to be married within a month. I planned it down to the very last detail, even composing and embellishing the wedding invitations.

As I removed my boots, I thought of something even worse: it could turn to boredom. I finished my evening toilette, lit a cigarette, and, reclining on the sofa, reflected that domestic routine and harmony could yet save the day. But this was quickly followed by the thought that our inherent dispositions might be incompatible, and what was to be done with two incompatible but inseparable dispositions? Eventually I dismissed these questions, for, after all, ours was a great and violent passion. I imagined myself married, with a beautiful child . . .",CO140CL10

3263,54,"“I even managed to pull the trigger. Clemência was terrified; she took it off me and forgave me. We decided to bring forward the wedding date and, of my own accord, I set one condition: I would donate the twenty thousand contos to the National Library. Clemência threw herself into my arms and sealed her approval with a kiss. I donated the twenty thousand contos. You must have read about it in the papers. Three weeks later, we were married. You’re sighing with relief, Reverend, as if we had reached the end of the story.",CO140CL10
3264,55,"As if! Now we come to the tragic bit. I can shorten some bits and leave others out entirely; I will restrict myself to Clemência.

A few seconds later, José Maria stopped, sat down, and continued his story, this time wilder, more frenzied, and clearly even crazier. He told of the state of dread in which he lived, his sorrows and his suspicions.",CO140CL10
3266,57,"No longer could he bite into a fig as he would once have done; the fear of a worm diminished the pleasure. He did not believe the happy faces of people passing by in the street: worry, hatred, desire, sadness, and other things seemed to lurk in three-quarters of them. He lived in fear that a child of his would be born blind, or deaf and dumb, or consumptive, or a murderer. He could not give a dinner party without becoming depressed at the thought that, as soon as the soup was served, a word from him, a gesture from his wife, or some blunder by the servants might provoke some flippant postprandial jibe, outside in the street, under a lamppost.",CO140CL10
3267,58,"Experience had given him a horror of being mocked. He confessed to the priest that, in reality, he had never gained anything by this horror; on the contrary, he had lost, because he had even caused blood to be shed . . . He would tell the monsignor all about that too. The previous night he had gone to bed early, and dreamed . . . Who did the priest think he had dreamed of?",CO140CL10
3268,59,“I have no idea.”,CO140CL10
3269,60,"“I dreamed that the Devil was reading me the Gospel. When he reached the part where Jesus talks about the lilies of the field, the Devil picked some and gave them to me. ‘Take them,’ he said to me, ‘they are the lilies of the Scriptures; as you know, not even Solomon in all his glory could match them. Solomon is wisdom. Do you know what these lilies are, José? They are your twenties.’ I stared at them in wonderment; they were more beautiful than I could imagine.",CO140CL10
3270,61,"The Devil took them, sniffed them, and told me to sniff them too. I can barely bring myself to tell you; as soon as they reached my nose, I saw a repulsive, reeking reptile come crawling out of them. I screamed and threw the flowers away. Then, roaring with laughter, the Devil said: ‘José Maria, these are your twenties.’ His laughter was almost a cackle—ka, ka, ka, ka, ka . . .”",CO140CL10
3271,62,"José Maria laughed uncontrollably, a laugh that was both shrill and diabolical. Suddenly he stopped. He stood up, saying that, as soon as he opened his eyes, he saw his wife standing before him, distraught and disheveled. Clemência’s eyes were gentle, but he told her that even gentle eyes can wound. She threw herself at his feet.",CO140CL10
3272,63,"At this point, José Maria’s face was so contorted that the priest, who, by now, was also standing, began to back away, trembling and ashen-faced. “No, you miserable wretch! No! You won’t get away from me now,” José Maria thundered as he lunged toward the priest. His eyes were bulging, his temples throbbing; the priest stepped back . . . and back . . .

3277,5,"What ringlets? Maria Olímpia didn’t ask what ringlets these where; they belonged to the brigadier’s widow, who wore them for pleasure, and not for fashion. I believe this took place in 1853. Maria Olímpia read and reread the note; she examined the handwriting, which seemed of a woman but thinly veiled. Mentally, she went through her friends’ first lines, to see if she could find the author.",CO141CL07

She measured her beauty with that of the other woman. Neither the eyes nor the mouth could be compared; the widow had very narrow shoulders, a big head, and an ugly walk. She was tall; but what does being tall matter? And thirty-five years old, nine more than her? While she made her considerations, she arranged, pinned and unpinned the shawl.",CO141CL07

She concluded that the first two where the best; but then a complication emerged — minimal, really — but so subtle and deep in its solution that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her to our thinkers of 1906. The question was to know which shawl to choose, as the husband, recently a lawyer, asked her to be economical.",CO141CL07

Maria Olímpia imagined a bunch of annoying things, she would go to the window, and then turn back inside, she feared an accident or a sudden disease; she also thought he was in a jury session. Five o’clock and nothing. The widow’s ringlets also blackened before her, between disease and the jury, in shades of dark blue, which probably were the devil’s colors.",CO141CL07
3287,15,"It was truly to exhaust the patience of a twenty-six-year-old girl. Twenty-six years old; she was no more than that. She was the daughter of an assemblyman from the Regency time, leaving her still a child; and it was an aunt who raised her with distinction. Her aunt didn’t take her too soon to balls or performances. She was religious, and first took her to church. Maria Olímpia had the vocation for the outer life, and in processions and sung masses, she really enjoyed the sounds, the pomp; the devotion was sincere, tepid and distracted. The first thing she saw on the church box pew was herself.",CO141CL07
3288,16,"She enjoyed particularly looking down on people from above, staring at the crowd of women kneeling or seated, and boys who, from below down the choir or at side doors, spiced up the Latin liturgies with loving attitudes.

It could be that she came to doubt the anonymous letter; it could be the two shawls that weighed on her conscience. At the end of dinner, Galvão explained his delay; he had walked to the Provisório theater, bought a box for that evening: The Lombards[2] was on. After that, he sent for a carriage . . .",CO141CL07

When Galvão saw her ready to go, a little later, he was enchanted. My wife is beautiful, he thought; and he made a gesture to hold her tight to the chest; but his wife stepped back, asking him not to wrinkle her.

3302,30,"They got into the carriage and went to the theater. Who was in the cabin contiguous to theirs? The widow and her mother. This coincidence, the daughter of fate, could induce one to believe in some previous arrangement. Maria Olímpia suspected it; but, the sensation of her entrance didn’t give her time to examine the suspicion. The entire room had turned around to see her, and she drank, in deep gulps, the milk of public admiration. Moreover, her husband had the Machiavellian inspiration to say at her ear:",CO141CL07
3303,31,"It would have been better if you had sent her an invitation; she would owe us the favor. Any suspicion would fall apart in the face of these words. However, she was careful not to lose sight of them - and she renewed the decision every five minutes for half an hour, until when, not being able to pay attention, she let it go. There she goes, restless, straight to the bright lights, to the splendor of the costumes, as if to the opera, as if asking every single thing for some delight where a cold and private soul can stretch.",CO141CL07

During the intervals, chatting with the widow, Maria Olímpia had her usual voice and gesture, uncalculated, effortless, without resentment, the letter forgotten. And, exactly during the intervals her husband, with discretion rare among the sons of men, went to the corridors or the foyer to ask for news from the ministry.",CO141CL07
3305,33,"At the end, the widow and Maria Olímpia left the box together and walked along the corridors. The modesty the widow wore enhanced the magnificence of her friend.

She had proportionate and beautiful shoulders.",CO141CL07

3307,35,"A week after, Maria Olímpia received another anonymous letter. It was longer and more explicit. Others arrived, once a week for three months. Maria Olímpia read the first with some annoyance; the next ones hardened her sensibility. There was no doubt her husband was often out too long, unlike what he used to do before, or he would go out in the evening and return late at night; but, according to what he said, he spent his time at the Wallerstein or at Bernardo’s at political lectures.",CO141CL07

What was concubinage? Maria Olímpia wanted to ask her husband, but she forgot the word and gave no more thought to it.",CO141CL07
3312,40,"In the meanwhile, the husband heard his wife was receiving letters by mail. Letters from whom? This news was a tough and unexpected blow.

3323,51,"She wasn’t smiling anymore; her voice trembled. She still held the letter back, once, twice, three times. She even thought of tearing it up, but that would be worse, and she wouldn’t go all the way through. It was really a peculiar situation. When she saw she had no alternative, she decided to surrender. What better occasion to read on his face the truth? The letter was one of the most explicit; it spoke about the widow in raw terms. Maria Olímpia handed it over.",CO141CL07
3324,52,"“I didn’t want to show this,” she said at first, “as I haven’t shown you the others I have been receiving and throwing away, they’re nonsense, intrigues being done to . . . Read, read the letter.",CO141CL07

When he, after a few minutes, said two or three words, he already had a composed face and a sketch of a smile. But his wife, who didn’t see through him, answered with her head still bowed; she only looked up after three or four minutes, and not to gloat at him once and for all, but little by little, as if she feared to find in his eyes the confirmation of the anonymous writer. To the contrary, seeing a smile, she thought it was the smile of innocence and spoke of something else.",CO141CL07

People who knew her at that time say that what she thought of her exterior life was the feeling of an immense public caress, at a distance; it was her way of being loved. Entering in the Cassino, she was going to receive more copious admiration, and she wasn’t wrong, because it came, and from a high class.",CO141CL07

The devil of a jewel looked good on her with both tips up, emerging from the black hair. Everybody in that hall had always admired the widow.

3356,22,"“Yes. Laboceta’s singing, and Jacobson, and there’s a ballet scene. You’ve never seen I Lombardi?”",CO141CL10
3357,23,“Never.”,CO141CL10
3358,24,"“Anyway, that’s why I’m late. So what punishment do you deserve now? Perhaps I should cut off the tip of that turned-up little nose of yours . . .”",CO141CL10
3359,25,"As he accompanied his words with a gesture, she drew back her head; then she finished her coffee. We really should have pity on the soul of this young lady. While the first chords of I Lombardi were already echoing inside her, the anonymous letter struck a lugubrious note, a kind of requiem. And might the letter not simply be a vicious calumny?",CO141CL10
3360,26,"Obviously it couldn’t be anything else: some wild invention of her enemies, either to upset her or to set the couple quarreling. That was it. In the meantime, now that she was forewarned, she wouldn’t let them out of her sight. Here an idea came to her: she asked her husband if he would send an invitation to the widow to join them.",CO141CL10
3361,27,"“No,” he replied. “The carriage only has two seats, and I have no intention of sitting up with the coachman.”",CO141CL10
3362,28,"Maria Olímpia smiled contentedly, and stood up. She had long wanted to hear I Lombardi. Let’s go! Tra, la, la, la . . . Half an hour later, she went upstairs to dress. When Galvão saw her come down a short time later, ready to go, he was delighted. “My wife is beautiful,” he thought, and made as if to clasp her to his chest. But his wife pulled back, telling him not to rumple her dress. And when he, playing the valet, tried to straighten the feather in her hair, she said to him, rather irritated:",CO141CL10
3363,29,"“Stop it, Eduardo! Is the carriage here yet?”",CO141CL10
3364,30,"They got into the carriage and set off for the theater. And who should be in the box next to theirs? The widow and her mother, of course. This coincidence—the daughter of fate—might lead one to believe there had been some prior arrangement. Maria Olímpia did, indeed, suspect as much, but the sensation caused by her arrival gave her no time to examine her suspicion. The entire audience had turned to look at her, and she drank in, in slow draughts, the milk of public admiration. Moreover, her husband had the Machiavellian inspiration to say in her ear:",CO141CL10
3365,31,"“Perhaps you should have invited her, then she would have owed us the favor.” Any suspicion would evaporate at such words. Nevertheless, she took care not to let them out of her sight, a resolution she renewed every five minutes for half an hour, until, unable to remain vigilant, she allowed her attention to wander. Off the restless thing goes, heading straight for the bright lights, the magnificent costumes, lingering briefly on the opera itself, as if demanding from all those things some delicious sensation in which a cold, individual soul could luxuriate.",CO141CL10
3366,32,"And then back it came to her, to her fan, her gloves, the frills on her dress, which really was rather magnificent. Talking with the widow during the intervals, Maria Olímpia maintained her usual voice and gestures, uncalculated and effortless, not a trace of resentment, the letter entirely forgotten. And during the intervals her husband, of course, with a discretion rare among the sons of men, went off to the aisles or the foyer, looking for news about the government.",CO141CL10
3367,33,"At the end, the two ladies left the box together and made their way down to the foyer. The modesty with which the widow was dressed may well have emphasized the magnificence of her friend. Her features, however, were not as the latter had described them while trying on shawls that morning. No, sir; the widow’s features were charming, with a certain originality about them. Her shoulders were pretty and perfectly proportioned.",CO141CL10
3368,34,"She was not thirty-five but thirty-one; she was born in 1822, on the very eve of independence, so much so that her father, jokingly, began to call her Ipiranga, and the nickname stuck among her friends. Furthermore, the baptism registry was there for all to see in Santa Rita.",CO141CL10
3369,35,"A week later, Maria Olímpia received another anonymous letter. It was longer and more explicit. Others followed, once a week for three months. Maria Olímpia read the first with some irritation, but she gradually became hardened to those that followed. There was no doubt that, unlike before, her husband often came home late from work, or he would go out in the evenings and return very late; but, according to him, he spent the time at Wallerstein’s or Bernardo’s, discussing politics.",CO141CL10
3370,36,"And this was true, but only for five or ten minutes, the time necessary to pick up some anecdote or novelty he could repeat at home as an alibi. From there he would go to Largo de São Francisco and catch the public omnibus.",CO141CL10
3371,37,"It was all true. And yet, still she refused to believe the letters. Lately, she no longer bothered to take the trouble to reject what they said; she would read them just once and tear them up. As time passed, other, less vague signs began to appear, little by little, in the way that land gradually appears to sailors; but this Columbus stubbornly refused to believe in America.",CO141CL10
3372,38,"She denied what she saw; and when she could no longer deny it, she interpreted it; then she would recall some instance of a hallucination, a tale about illusory appearances, and on this soft and comfortable pillow she would lay her head and sleep.",CO141CL10
3373,39,"By now the law practice was prospering, and Galvão hosted card games and dinner parties; they went to balls, theaters, and horse races. Maria Olímpia was happy and radiant; she was beginning to be thought of as one of the foremost ladies of fashion. And she was frequently in the company of the widow, despite the letters, and to such an extent that one letter commented: “There seems little point in writing to you again, since you are evidently relishing this distasteful concubinage.” What on earth was concubinage? Maria Olímpia wanted to ask her husband, but promptly forgot the word and thought no more about it.",CO141CL10
3374,40,"Meanwhile, it came to the attention of her husband that his wife was receiving letters in the post. Letters from whom? This was a hard and unexpected blow. Galvão scoured his memory for all the people who came to their house, those they might meet at theaters and balls, and found many likely candidates. Indeed, she did not lack admirers.",CO141CL10
3375,41,"“Letters from whom?” he repeated, biting his lip and furrowing his brow.",CO141CL10
3376,42,"For seven days he was restless and irritable, spying on his wife and spending most of his time at home. On the eighth day, a letter arrived.",CO141CL10
3377,43,“For me?” he asked brightly.,CO141CL10
3378,44,"“No, it’s for me,” replied Maria Olímpia, reading the envelope. “It looks like Mariana or Lula Fontoura’s handwriting.”",CO141CL10
3379,45,"She didn’t want to open it, but her husband told her to read it; it might be some grave news. Maria Olímpia read the letter and folded it up, smiling; she was about to put it away when her husband asked her what it was.",CO141CL10
3380,46,"“You smiled,” he said teasingly. “It must be some joke at my expense.”",CO141CL10
3381,47,“As if! It’s about sewing patterns.”,CO141CL10
3382,48,“Then let me see.”,CO141CL10
3383,49,"“What for, Eduardo?”",CO141CL10
3384,50,"“What’s the matter? If you don’t want to show me, there must be some reason. Give it here.”",CO141CL10
3385,51,"He was no longer smiling; his voice trembled. She again refused to hand over the letter, once, twice, three times. She even considered tearing it up, but that would only make matters worse, and she wouldn’t be able to destroy it completely. It really was a rather peculiar situation. When she saw that there was no other solution, she decided to give in. What better occasion to read the expression of truth on his face? The letter was one of the most explicit; it talked about the widow in the crudest of terms. Maria Olímpia handed it to him.",CO141CL10
3386,52,"“I didn’t want to show you this,” she said first, “just as I haven’t shown you the others that I’ve received and thrown away. It’s all silly tittle-tattle, designed to . . . Go on, read it, read the letter.”",CO141CL10
3387,53,"Galvão opened the letter and read avidly. She hung her head low, studying at close quarters the fringe on her dress. She did not see him turn pale. When, a few minutes later, he said a few words, his face was already perfectly composed and bore an inkling of a smile. But his wife, failing to divine his true feelings, replied with her head still bowed; she raised it only three or four minutes later, and not to look straight at him, but bit by bit, as if she feared finding in his eyes confirmation of the anonymous letter. Seeing, on the contrary, that he was smiling, she thought this was the smile of innocence, and changed the subject.",CO141CL10
3388,54,"The husband redoubled his precautions; it would also seem that he could not help feeling a certain admiration for his wife. The widow, for her part, having been warned about the letters, felt deeply ashamed, but reacted quickly by becoming even more affectionate toward her dear, dear friend.",CO141CL10
3389,55,"In the second or third week of August, Galvão became a member of the Cassino Fluminense club. This was one of his wife’s fondest dreams. September 6 was the widow’s birthday, as we already know. The day before, Maria Olímpia (accompanied by her aunt who was visiting the city) went to buy her a gift, as was their usual habit. She bought her a ring.",CO141CL10
3390,56,"At the same establishment she saw a charming piece of jewelry, a diamond hairpiece in the shape of a crescent moon, the emblem of Diana, which would suit her very well, pinned just above her forehead. Even when the symbol comes from Muhammad, anything with diamonds in it counts as Christian. Maria Olímpia naturally thought of the first night that they would be attending the Cassino, and her aunt, seeing that she wanted it, offered to buy it for her. Too late; it had already been sold.",CO141CL10
3391,57,"The evening of the ball arrived. Maria Olímpia felt a thrill of excitement as she ascended the staircase at the Cassino. People who knew her at the time say that what she experienced when out in the world was a sense of being caressed by the public gaze, albeit at a distance; it was her way of being loved. Now that they were members of the Cassino, she would be gathering a veritable cornucopia of admiring looks. She was not mistaken, for this is precisely what happened, and from the highest echelons too.",CO141CL10
3392,58,"It was at around half-past ten that the widow arrived. She looked really beautiful, impeccably dressed, and wearing the crescent moon of diamonds on her head. The wretched jewel suited her devilishly well, with its two points turned upward, emerging from among her dark hair. Everyone in the hall had always admired the widow. She had many female friends, some closer than others, and more than a few admirers, and she possessed the kind of personality that comes alive under the bright lights. The head of a certain legation simply would not stop recommending her to newer members of the diplomatic corps:",CO141CL10
3393,59,"“Causez avec Mme. Tavares; c’est adorable!” Thus it had been on other nights, and thus it was on this one.",CO141CL10
3394,60,"“I’ve had hardly a moment to talk to you tonight,” she said to Maria Olímpia, as midnight approached.",CO141CL10
3395,61,"“It’s only natural,” said the other, opening and closing her fan. And, after moistening her lips, as if to prime them with all the venom she had in her heart: “My dear Ipiranga, tonight, you are a very charming widow . . . Have you come to seduce yet another husband?”",CO141CL10
3396,62,"The widow turned pale and speechless. With her eyes, Maria Olímpia added something that humiliated the widow utterly, splattering her triumph with mud. For the rest of the night, they spoke little; three days later, they broke with each other for good.",CO141CL10

3400,4,"Before informing you of a new discovery, which I consider will bring some luster to our nation, please allow me to thank you for your prompt response to my invitation. I know that only the loftiest of interests have brought you here today, but I am also aware—and it would be ungrateful on my part not to be—that your entirely legitimate sense of scientific curiosity is mingled with a modicum of affection. I very much hope that I may prove worthy of both.",CO106CL12
3401,5,"My discovery is not a recent one; it dates from the latter part of 1876. I did not reveal it then for a reason you will easily comprehend, and if it weren’t for Globo, surely our capital’s most interesting newspaper, I would not be revealing it now. The work I have come here to discuss with you still lacks a few final touches, verifications, and complementary experiments. However, when Globo reported that an English expert has discovered the phonetic language of insects, citing a study undertaken with flies, I immediately wrote to colleagues in Europe, and keenly await their responses.",CO106CL12
3402,6,"Since it is undoubtedly the case that, in the field of aerial navigation, so ably invented by our very own Father Bartolomeu, the names of foreigners have taken all the glory, while that of our compatriot is scarcely remembered even by his own people, I was determined to avoid the fate of that eminent Flying Priest, and so have come to this rostrum to proclaim loud and clear, to the entire universe, that long before that English expert, and far beyond the British Isles, I, a humble naturalist, discovered exactly the same thing, and made a much better job of it.",CO106CL12
3403,7,"Gentlemen, I am about to astonish you, as I would have astonished Aristotle had I asked him: “Do you believe that a social order could ever be imposed upon spiders?” Aristotle would have replied in the negative, as will all of you, because it is simply impossible to believe that such a shy and solitary arthropod made for work alone and not for love, could ever be inducted into some form of social organization. Well, I have achieved the impossible.",CO106CL12
3404,8,"I hear some laughter among the other curious murmurings. One must always strive to overcome one’s prejudices, gentlemen. Spiders may strike you as inferior precisely because you do not know them. You love your dogs and hold cats and hens in high esteem, and yet you fail to notice that the humble spider neither jumps nor barks like a dog, nor meows like a cat, nor clucks like a hen. Nor does it buzz or bite like a mosquito, or rob us of our blood and sleep the way fleas do. All these creatures are the very model of vagrant parasites.",CO106CL12
3405,9,"Even the ant, so praised for certain qualities, preys upon our sugar and our crops, and builds its home by stealing someone else’s. The spider, gentlemen, neither troubles nor defrauds us; indeed, it catches flies, our sworn enemies. The spider spins, weaves, works, and dies. What better example could there be of patience, order, foresight, respect, and, dare I say it, humanity? As for its talents, there can be no doubt. From Pliny to Darwin, naturalists the world over speak as one in praise of this tiny bug, whose marvelous web is destroyed in less than a minute by your servant’s thoughtless broom.",CO106CL12
3406,10,"And if time permitted, I would now repeat all of these men’s wise opinions; however, I have a lot to get through and so must be brief. I have them here, not quite all of them, but almost; I have, for example, this excellent monograph by Büchner, who studied the psychological lives of animals with such perspicacity. In citing Darwin and Büchner, I am, of course, merely paying due respect to two geniuses of the first order, without (as my vestments attest) in any way absolving them of the unfounded and erroneous theories of materialism.",CO106CL12
3407,11,"Yes, gentlemen, I have discovered a species of spider that has the gift of speech. Initially I collected just a few of these new arthropods, then many more, and set about imposing a social order on them. The first of these marvelous specimens came to my attention on December 15, 1876. It was so large, so brightly colored, with a red dorsal patch and blue transversal stripes, so swift in its movements and at times so cheerful, that it completely captured my attention.",CO106CL12
3408,12,"The next day, three more appeared, and the four of them took possession of a suitable corner in my country house. I studied them at length, and was full of admiration. Nothing, however, could compare to my surprise upon discovering the arachnid language; for it is, gentlemen, a rich and varied tongue, with its own syntactical structure, verbs, conjugations, declensions, Latin cases, and onomatopoeia. I am currently engaged in meticulously compiling its grammar for use in schools and universities, based on the initial summary I prepared for my own use.",CO106CL12
3409,13,"It has, as you can imagine, taken extraordinary patience to overcome this most testing of challenges. I often lost heart, but my love of science gave me the strength to press ahead with a task that, I can tell you now, no man could hope to accomplish twice in his lifetime.",CO106CL12
3410,14,"I will keep the technical descriptions and linguistic analysis for another time and place. The purpose of this lecture is, as I said, to safeguard the rights of Brazilian science with this timely protest, and, having done so, to tell you about the ways in which I consider my own work superior to that of that English expert. I will need to demonstrate this, and for that reason I ask for your close attention.",CO106CL12
3411,15,"Within one month, I had collected twenty spiders; the following month, there were fifty-five and, by March 1877, four hundred and ninety. The two main factors involved in collecting them were: using their language as soon as I began to discern something of it, together with the sheer terror I instilled in them. My height, my flowing vestments, and my mastery of their language all made them believe that I was the god of spiders, and, from that point on, they worshipped me.",CO106CL12
3412,16,"And behold the benefits of their delusion. I followed their every action with great attention and detail, jotting down all my observations in a notebook, which they believed to be a record of their sins, thus reinforcing still further their virtuous behavior. My flute was also of great assistance. As you know, or should know, spiders are quite mad about music.",CO106CL12
3413,17,"Mere association was not enough; I needed to give them a suitable form of government. I hesitated in my choice of system; many of the current forms seemed to me adequate, some even excellent, but they all had the disadvantage of already existing. Let me explain. Any current form of government would expose them to comparisons that might be used to belittle them. I needed either to find a brand-new system, or to reintroduce one that had long since been abandoned.",CO106CL12
3414,18,"Naturally, I chose the latter, and nothing seemed more fitting than a republic in the Venetian mold; I even adopted the same epithet. This obsolete system, which was, in general terms, unlike any other current system of government, had the added advantage of all complicated mechanisms, namely, it would put my young society’s political skills to the test.",CO106CL12
3415,19,"There was another motive behind my choice. Among the various electoral methods once used in the Venice of old was the bag and ball, which is how the sons of the nobility were initiated into matters of state. Balls bearing the candidates’ names were placed in the bag, and every year a certain number were taken out, with the chosen few being deemed suitable for public service. Such a system will provoke laughter among experts in electoral suffrage, but that is not the case with me.",CO106CL12
3416,20,"For it precludes the follies of passion, the errors of ineptitude, and the commingling of corruption and greed. This was not my only reason for choosing it; I felt that a community so skilled in the spinning of webs would find the use of the electoral bag easy to adapt to, indeed almost second nature.",CO106CL12
3417,21,"My proposal was accepted. “The Most Serene Republic” struck them as a magnificent title: high-sounding and generous, and suitably aggrandizing of their work as a collective.",CO106CL12
3418,22,"I would not say, gentlemen, that my work has reached perfection, nor that it will do so in the near future. My pupils are not Campanella’s solarians or More’s utopians; they are a new people, who cannot in a single bound o’erleap our most venerable nations. And time is not a workman who willingly hands his tools to another; it will, though, serve far better than any paper theories, which look good on paper, but prove lame in practice. What I will say is that, notwithstanding the uncertainties of the age, the spiders continue to make progress, having at their disposal some of the virtues which I believe essential for a state to endure. One of those virtues, as I have already mentioned and as I will now demonstrate, is perseverance, the long-suffering patience of Penelope.",CO106CL12
3419,23,"In effect, ever since they first grasped that the electoral act was the fundamental basis of public life, they set out to exercise it with the utmost punctiliousness. Weaving the bag was itself a national undertaking. It was five inches long, three inches wide, and woven from the finest threads into a solid, sturdy piece of work.",CO106CL12
3420,24,"To make it, ten ladies of the very highest rank were selected by acclamation, and given the title “mothers of the republic” along with various other privileges and perquisites. A real masterpiece, of that you can be sure. The electoral process itself is quite simple.",CO106CL12
3421,25,"The names of the candidates, each of whom must fulfill certain conditions, are inscribed on the balls by a public official known as the Inscriptions Officer. On election day, the balls are placed in the bag and then picked out by the Withdrawals Officer, until the required number of candidates has been chosen.  What was simply an initiation ceremony in the Venice of old, here serves to fill all public positions.",CO106CL12
3422,26,"At first the election passed off without incident. But soon afterward, one of the legislators declared that the election had been tainted, because the bag contained two balls each inscribed with the name of the same candidate. The assembly verified the truth of the allegation, and declared that the bag would henceforth be only two inches wide, not three, thus restricting the bag’s capacity and limiting (which was as good as eliminating) the scope for fraud. However, in the following election, it transpired that the name of one of the candidates had not been inscribed on the relevant ball; whether this was due to carelessness or willful omission on the part of the public official is not known.",CO106CL12
3423,27,"The official insisted that he had no recollection of seeing the illustrious candidate, but nobly added that it was not impossible that he had been given the name, in which case it had not been a matter of deliberate exclusion, but of forgetfulness on his part. Faced with so ineluctable a psychological phenomenon as forgetfulness, the assembly could not bring itself to punish the official; however, in the belief that the narrowness of the bag could give rise to nefarious exclusions, it revoked the previous law and restored the bag to its full three inches.",CO106CL12
3424,28,"Meanwhile, gentlemen, the first magistrate passed away and three citizens presented themselves as candidates for the position. Only two of them were important: Hazeroth and Magog, the respective leaders of the rectilinear party and the curvilinear party. I should explain these names to you. Since arachnids are masters of geometry, it is geometry that divides them politically. Some are convinced that spiders should always spin their webs with straight threads, and they adhere to the rectilinear party. Others, however, think that webs should be spun using curved threads, and they form the curvilinear party.",CO106CL12
3425,29,"There is a third party, which occupies the middle ground with the proposition that webs should be woven with both straight and curved threads, and is therefore called the recto-curvilinear party. Finally, there is a fourth political grouping, the anti-recto-curvilinear party, which sweeps away all such principles and proposes the use of webs woven from thin air, resulting in an entirely transparent and lightweight structure with no lines of any sort. Since geometry could only divide them, without inflaming their passions, they have adopted a purely symbolic geometry. For some, the straight line represents noble sentiments: justice, probity, integrity, and perseverance, while base or inferior sentiments such as flattery, fraud, betrayal, and perfidy are quite clearly curved.",CO106CL12
3426,30,"Their adversaries disagree, saying that the curved line is the line of virtue and wisdom, because it is the expression of modesty and humility, whereas ignorance, arrogance, foolishness, and boasting are straight, indeed rigidly so. The third party, less angular, less exclusive, has trimmed away the exaggerations of both sides and combined their contrasting positions, proclaiming the simultaneous nature of lines to be the exact representation of the physical and moral world. The fourth grouping simply repudiates everything.",CO106CL12
3427,31,"Neither Hazeroth nor Magog was elected. The relevant balls were drawn from the bag, but were deemed invalid—Hazaroth’s because the first letter of his name was missing, and Magog’s because his lacked the last letter. The remaining, triumphant name was that of an ambitious millionaire of obscure political opinions, who promptly ascended the ducal throne to the general amazement of the republic. However, the defeated candidates were not content to rest on the winner’s laurels; they called for an official inquiry. The inquiry showed that the Inscriptions Officer had intentionally misspelled their names.",CO106CL12
3428,32,"The officer confessed to both the error and the intention, explaining that it had been nothing more than a simple ellipsis; a purely literary misdemeanor, if that. Since it was not possible to prosecute someone for errors of spelling or rhetoric, it seemed sensible to review the law once again. That very same day, it was decreed that the bag would henceforth be made from a fine gauze, through which the balls could be read by the public, and ipso facto by the candidates themselves, who would thus have the opportunity to correct any misspellings.",CO106CL12
3429,33,"Unfortunately, gentlemen, fiddling with the law brings nothing but trouble. That same door flung wide to honesty also served the cunning of a certain Nabiga, who connived with the Withdrawals Officer to get himself a seat on the assembly. There was one vacancy to be filled and three candidates; the officer selected the balls with his eyes fixed on his accomplice, who only stopped shaking his head when the ball in question was his own. That was all it took to put paid to the idea of a gauze bag. With exemplary patience, the assembly restored the thick fabric of the previous regime, but, to avoid any further ellipses, literary or otherwise, it decreed that balls with incorrect inscriptions could henceforth be validated if five persons swore an oath that the name inscribed was indeed that of the candidate in question.",CO106CL12
3430,34,"This new statute gave rise to a new and unforeseen issue, as you will see. It concerned the election of a Donations Collector, a public servant charged with raising public revenue in the form of voluntary donations. Among the candidates were one called Caneca and another called Nebraska. The ball drawn from the bag was Nebraska’s. There was, however, a mistake, in that the last letter was missing, but five witnesses swore an oath in accordance with the law that the duly elected candidate was the republic’s one and only Nebraska.",CO106CL12
3431,35,"Everything seemed to be settled, until the candidate Caneca sought leave to prove that the name on the ball in question was not Nebraska’s, but his own. The justice of the peace granted the hearing. As this point, they summoned a great philologist—perhaps the greatest in the republic, as well as being a good metaphysician and a rather fine mathematician—who proved the matter as follows:",CO106CL12
3432,36,"“First of all,” he said, “you should note that the absence of the last letter of the name ‘Nebraska’ is no accident. Why was it left incomplete? Not through fatigue or love of brevity, since only the final letter, a mere a, is missing. Lack of space? Not that, either; look closely and you will see that there is still space for another two or three syllables.",CO106CL12
3433,37,"Hence the omission is intentional, and the intention could only be to draw the reader’s eye to the letter k, being the last one written, hanging there abandoned and alone, devoid of purpose. Now, then, the brain has a tendency, which no law can override, to reproduce letters in two ways: the graphic form k, and the sonic form, which could equally be written ca. Thus, by drawing the eyes to the final letter written, the spelling defect instantly embeds it in the brain as the first syllable: Ca. Once so embedded, the natural impulse of the brain is then to read the whole name, and thus returns to the beginning of the word, to the initial ne of Nebrask, giving us Ca-ne.",CO106CL12
3434,38,"There remains the middle syllable, bras, and it is the easiest thing in the world to demonstrate how that can be reduced to another ca. I will not, however, demonstrate precisely how, since you lack the necessary preparation for a proper understanding of the spiritual or philosophical meaning of such a syllable, along with its origins and effects, its phases, modifications, logical and syntactical consequences, both deductive and inductive, as well as symbolic, and so forth. But taking that as read, we are faced with the final and incontrovertible proof of my initial assertion that the syllable ca is indeed joined to the first two, Ca-ne, giving us the name Caneca.”",CO106CL12
3435,39,"The law was amended, gentlemen, abolishing both sworn testimonials and textual interpretations, and introducing another innovation, this time the simultaneous reduction, by half an inch, of both the length and width of the bag. The modification did not, however, avoid a minor abuse in the election of bailiffs, and the bag was restored to its original dimensions, but this time in triangular form.",CO106CL12

I know that only the loftiest of interests have brought you here today, but I am also aware—and it would be ungrateful on my part not to be—that your entirely legitimate sense of scientific curiosity is mingled with a modicum of affection. I very much hope that I may prove worthy of both.",CO106CL10
3443,5,"My discovery is not a recent one; it dates from the latter part of 1876. I did not reveal it then for a reason you will easily comprehend, and if it weren’t for Globo, surely our capital’s most interesting newspaper, I would not be revealing it now. The work I have come here to discuss with you still lacks a few final touches, verifications, and complementary experiments. However, when Globo reported that an English expert has discovered the phonetic language of insects, citing a study undertaken with flies, I immediately wrote to colleagues in Europe, and keenly await their responses.",CO106CL10
3444,6,"Since it is undoubtedly the case that, in the field of aerial navigation, so ably invented by our very own Father Bartolomeu, the names of foreigners have taken all the glory, while that of our compatriot is scarcely remembered even by his own people, I was determined to avoid the fate of that eminent Flying Priest, and so have come to this rostrum to proclaim loud and clear, to the entire universe, that long before that English expert, and far beyond the British Isles, I, a humble naturalist, discovered exactly the same thing, and made a much better job of it.",CO106CL10
3445,7,"Gentlemen, I am about to astonish you, as I would have astonished Aristotle had I asked him: “Do you believe that a social order could ever be imposed upon spiders?” Aristotle would have replied in the negative, as will all of you, because it is simply impossible to believe that such a shy and solitary arthropod made for work alone and not for love, could ever be inducted into some form of social organization. Well, I have achieved the impossible.",CO106CL10
3446,8,"I hear some laughter among the other curious murmurings. One must always strive to overcome one’s prejudices, gentlemen. Spiders may strike you as inferior precisely because you do not know them. You love your dogs and hold cats and hens in high esteem, and yet you fail to notice that the humble spider neither jumps nor barks like a dog, nor meows like a cat, nor clucks like a hen. Nor does it buzz or bite like a mosquito, or rob us of our blood and sleep the way fleas do. All these creatures are the very model of vagrant parasites.",CO106CL10
3447,9,"Even the ant, so praised for certain qualities, preys upon our sugar and our crops, and builds its home by stealing someone else’s. The spider, gentlemen, neither troubles nor defrauds us; indeed, it catches flies, our sworn enemies. The spider spins, weaves, works, and dies. What better example could there be of patience, order, foresight, respect, and, dare I say it, humanity? As for its talents, there can be no doubt. From Pliny to Darwin, naturalists the world over speak as one in praise of this tiny bug, whose marvelous web is destroyed in less than a minute by your servant’s thoughtless broom.",CO106CL10
3448,10,"And if time permitted, I would now repeat all of these men’s wise opinions; however, I have a lot to get through and so must be brief. I have them here, not quite all of them, but almost; I have, for example, this excellent monograph by Büchner, who studied the psychological lives of animals with such perspicacity. In citing Darwin and Büchner, I am, of course, merely paying due respect to two geniuses of the first order, without (as my vestments attest) in any way absolving them of the unfounded and erroneous theories of materialism.",CO106CL10
3449,11,"Yes, gentlemen, I have discovered a species of spider that has the gift of speech. Initially I collected just a few of these new arthropods, then many more, and set about imposing a social order on them. The first of these marvelous specimens came to my attention on December 15, 1876. It was so large, so brightly colored, with a red dorsal patch and blue transversal stripes, so swift in its movements and at times so cheerful, that it completely captured my attention.",CO106CL10
3450,12,"The next day, three more appeared, and the four of them took possession of a suitable corner in my country house. I studied them at length, and was full of admiration. Nothing, however, could compare to my surprise upon discovering the arachnid language; for it is, gentlemen, a rich and varied tongue, with its own syntactical structure, verbs, conjugations, declensions, Latin cases, and onomatopoeia. I am currently engaged in meticulously compiling its grammar for use in schools and universities, based on the initial summary I prepared for my own use.",CO106CL10
3451,13,"It has, as you can imagine, taken extraordinary patience to overcome this most testing of challenges. I often lost heart, but my love of science gave me the strength to press ahead with a task that, I can tell you now, no man could hope to accomplish twice in his lifetime.",CO106CL10
3452,14,"I will keep the technical descriptions and linguistic analysis for another time and place. The purpose of this lecture is, as I said, to safeguard the rights of Brazilian science with this timely protest, and, having done so, to tell you about the ways in which I consider my own work superior to that of that English expert. I will need to demonstrate this, and for that reason I ask for your close attention.",CO106CL10
3453,15,"Within one month, I had collected twenty spiders; the following month, there were fifty-five and, by March 1877, four hundred and ninety. The two main factors involved in collecting them were: using their language as soon as I began to discern something of it, together with the sheer terror I instilled in them. My height, my flowing vestments, and my mastery of their language all made them believe that I was the god of spiders, and, from that point on, they worshipped me.",CO106CL10
3454,16,"And behold the benefits of their delusion. I followed their every action with great attention and detail, jotting down all my observations in a notebook, which they believed to be a record of their sins, thus reinforcing still further their virtuous behavior. My flute was also of great assistance. As you know, or should know, spiders are quite mad about music.",CO106CL10
3455,17,"Mere association was not enough; I needed to give them a suitable form of government. I hesitated in my choice of system; many of the current forms seemed to me adequate, some even excellent, but they all had the disadvantage of already existing. Let me explain. Any current form of government would expose them to comparisons that might be used to belittle them. I needed either to find a brand-new system, or to reintroduce one that had long since been abandoned.",CO106CL10
3456,18,"Naturally, I chose the latter, and nothing seemed more fitting than a republic in the Venetian mold; I even adopted the same epithet. This obsolete system, which was, in general terms, unlike any other current system of government, had the added advantage of all complicated mechanisms, namely, it would put my young society’s political skills to the test.",CO106CL10
3457,19,"There was another motive behind my choice. Among the various electoral methods once used in the Venice of old was the bag and ball, which is how the sons of the nobility were initiated into matters of state. Balls bearing the candidates’ names were placed in the bag, and every year a certain number were taken out, with the chosen few being deemed suitable for public service. Such a system will provoke laughter among experts in electoral suffrage, but that is not the case with me.",CO106CL10
3458,20,"For it precludes the follies of passion, the errors of ineptitude, and the commingling of corruption and greed. This was not my only reason for choosing it; I felt that a community so skilled in the spinning of webs would find the use of the electoral bag easy to adapt to, indeed almost second nature.",CO106CL10
3459,21,"My proposal was accepted. “The Most Serene Republic” struck them as a magnificent title: high-sounding and generous, and suitably aggrandizing of their work as a collective.",CO106CL10
3460,22,"I would not say, gentlemen, that my work has reached perfection, nor that it will do so in the near future. My pupils are not Campanella’s solarians or More’s utopians; they are a new people, who cannot in a single bound o’erleap our most venerable nations. And time is not a workman who willingly hands his tools to another; it will, though, serve far better than any paper theories, which look good on paper, but prove lame in practice. What I will say is that, notwithstanding the uncertainties of the age, the spiders continue to make progress, having at their disposal some of the virtues which I believe essential for a state to endure. One of those virtues, as I have already mentioned and as I will now demonstrate, is perseverance, the long-suffering patience of Penelope.",CO106CL10
3461,23,"In effect, ever since they first grasped that the electoral act was the fundamental basis of public life, they set out to exercise it with the utmost punctiliousness. Weaving the bag was itself a national undertaking. It was five inches long, three inches wide, and woven from the finest threads into a solid, sturdy piece of work.",CO106CL10
3462,24,"To make it, ten ladies of the very highest rank were selected by acclamation, and given the title “mothers of the republic” along with various other privileges and perquisites. A real masterpiece, of that you can be sure. The electoral process itself is quite simple.",CO106CL10
3463,25,"The names of the candidates, each of whom must fulfill certain conditions, are inscribed on the balls by a public official known as the Inscriptions Officer. On election day, the balls are placed in the bag and then picked out by the Withdrawals Officer, until the required number of candidates has been chosen. What was simply an initiation ceremony in the Venice of old, here serves to fill all public positions.",CO106CL10
3464,26,"At first the election passed off without incident. But soon afterward, one of the legislators declared that the election had been tainted, because the bag contained two balls each inscribed with the name of the same candidate. The assembly verified the truth of the allegation, and declared that the bag would henceforth be only two inches wide, not three, thus restricting the bag’s capacity and limiting (which was as good as eliminating) the scope for fraud. However, in the following election, it transpired that the name of one of the candidates had not been inscribed on the relevant ball; whether this was due to carelessness or willful omission on the part of the public official is not known.",CO106CL10
3465,27,"The official insisted that he had no recollection of seeing the illustrious candidate, but nobly added that it was not impossible that he had been given the name, in which case it had not been a matter of deliberate exclusion, but of forgetfulness on his part. Faced with so ineluctable a psychological phenomenon as forgetfulness, the assembly could not bring itself to punish the official; however, in the belief that the narrowness of the bag could give rise to nefarious exclusions, it revoked the previous law and restored the bag to its full three inches.",CO106CL10
3466,28,"Meanwhile, gentlemen, the first magistrate passed away and three citizens presented themselves as candidates for the position. Only two of them were important: Hazeroth and Magog, the respective leaders of the rectilinear party and the curvilinear party. I should explain these names to you. Since arachnids are masters of geometry, it is geometry that divides them politically. Some are convinced that spiders should always spin their webs with straight threads, and they adhere to the rectilinear party. Others, however, think that webs should be spun using curved threads, and they form the curvilinear party.",CO106CL10
3467,29,"There is a third party, which occupies the middle ground with the proposition that webs should be woven with both straight and curved threads, and is therefore called the recto-curvilinear party. Finally, there is a fourth political grouping, the anti-recto-curvilinear party, which sweeps away all such principles and proposes the use of webs woven from thin air, resulting in an entirely transparent and lightweight structure with no lines of any sort. Since geometry could only divide them, without inflaming their passions, they have adopted a purely symbolic geometry. For some, the straight line represents noble sentiments: justice, probity, integrity, and perseverance, while base or inferior sentiments such as flattery, fraud, betrayal, and perfidy are quite clearly curved.",CO106CL10
3468,30,"Their adversaries disagree, saying that the curved line is the line of virtue and wisdom, because it is the expression of modesty and humility, whereas ignorance, arrogance, foolishness, and boasting are straight, indeed rigidly so. The third party, less angular, less exclusive, has trimmed away the exaggerations of both sides and combined their contrasting positions, proclaiming the simultaneous nature of lines to be the exact representation of the physical and moral world. The fourth grouping simply repudiates everything.",CO106CL10
3469,31,"Neither Hazeroth nor Magog was elected. The relevant balls were drawn from the bag, but were deemed invalid—Hazaroth’s because the first letter of his name was missing, and Magog’s because his lacked the last letter. The remaining, triumphant name was that of an ambitious millionaire of obscure political opinions, who promptly ascended the ducal throne to the general amazement of the republic. However, the defeated candidates were not content to rest on the winner’s laurels; they called for an official inquiry. The inquiry showed that the Inscriptions Officer had intentionally misspelled their names.",CO106CL10
3470,32,"The officer confessed to both the error and the intention, explaining that it had been nothing more than a simple ellipsis; a purely literary misdemeanor, if that. Since it was not possible to prosecute someone for errors of spelling or rhetoric, it seemed sensible to review the law once again. That very same day, it was decreed that the bag would henceforth be made from a fine gauze, through which the balls could be read by the public, and ipso facto by the candidates themselves, who would thus have the opportunity to correct any misspellings.",CO106CL10
3471,33,"Unfortunately, gentlemen, fiddling with the law brings nothing but trouble. That same door flung wide to honesty also served the cunning of a certain Nabiga, who connived with the Withdrawals Officer to get himself a seat on the assembly. There was one vacancy to be filled and three candidates; the officer selected the balls with his eyes fixed on his accomplice, who only stopped shaking his head when the ball in question was his own. That was all it took to put paid to the idea of a gauze bag. With exemplary patience, the assembly restored the thick fabric of the previous regime, but, to avoid any further ellipses, literary or otherwise, it decreed that balls with incorrect inscriptions could henceforth be validated if five persons swore an oath that the name inscribed was indeed that of the candidate in question.",CO106CL10
3472,34,"This new statute gave rise to a new and unforeseen issue, as you will see. It concerned the election of a Donations Collector, a public servant charged with raising public revenue in the form of voluntary donations. Among the candidates were one called Caneca and another called Nebraska. The ball drawn from the bag was Nebraska’s. There was, however, a mistake, in that the last letter was missing, but five witnesses swore an oath in accordance with the law that the duly elected candidate was the republic’s one and only Nebraska.",CO106CL10
3473,35,"Everything seemed to be settled, until the candidate Caneca sought leave to prove that the name on the ball in question was not Nebraska’s, but his own. The justice of the peace granted the hearing. As this point, they summoned a great philologist—perhaps the greatest in the republic, as well as being a good metaphysician and a rather fine mathematician—who proved the matter as follows:",CO106CL10
3474,36,"“First of all,” he said, “you should note that the absence of the last letter of the name ‘Nebraska’ is no accident. Why was it left incomplete? Not through fatigue or love of brevity, since only the final letter, a mere a, is missing. Lack of space? Not that, either; look closely and you will see that there is still space for another two or three syllables.",CO106CL10
3475,37,"Hence the omission is intentional, and the intention could only be to draw the reader’s eye to the letter k, being the last one written, hanging there abandoned and alone, devoid of purpose. Now, then, the brain has a tendency, which no law can override, to reproduce letters in two ways: the graphic form k, and the sonic form, which could equally be written ca. Thus, by drawing the eyes to the final letter written, the spelling defect instantly embeds it in the brain as the first syllable: Ca. Once so embedded, the natural impulse of the brain is then to read the whole name, and thus returns to the beginning of the word, to the initial ne of Nebrask, giving us Ca-ne.",CO106CL10
3476,38,"There remains the middle syllable, bras, and it is the easiest thing in the world to demonstrate how that can be reduced to another ca. I will not, however, demonstrate precisely how, since you lack the necessary preparation for a proper understanding of the spiritual or philosophical meaning of such a syllable, along with its origins and effects, its phases, modifications, logical and syntactical consequences, both deductive and inductive, as well as symbolic, and so forth. But taking that as read, we are faced with the final and incontrovertible proof of my initial assertion that the syllable ca is indeed joined to the first two, Ca-ne, giving us the name Caneca.”",CO106CL10
3477,39,"The law was amended, gentlemen, abolishing both sworn testimonials and textual interpretations, and introducing another innovation, this time the simultaneous reduction, by half an inch, of both the length and width of the bag. The modification did not, however, avoid a minor abuse in the election of bailiffs, and the bag was restored to its original dimensions, but this time in triangular form.",CO106CL10
3478,40,"You will readily comprehend that such a form brings with it an inevitable consequence: many of the balls remained in the bottom of the bag. From this came the adoption of a cylindrical bag, which, later, evolved into an hourglass, which was recognized as having the same inconveniences as the triangle, and thus gave way to a crescent, and so on.",CO106CL10

He immediately wanted to know what it was; the lady of the house told him not to be so curious. It took only a few minutes for the whole table to be arguing about curiosity, whether it was a masculine or feminine attribute, and who had been responsible for us being cast out of paradise, Adam or Eve.

It was the Evil One who created the world, but God, who could read his thoughts, gave him a free hand in the matter, taking it upon himself only to correct or modify the results, so that hope of salvation or good deeds would not be subsumed by the power of evil. And the divine Will soon manifested itself, for when the Evil One created darkness, God created light, and thus the first day was made. On the second day, when the waters were created, storms and hurricanes erupted, but then gentle afternoon breezes came down from the divine mind. On the third day, the earth was created, and from it sprang forth plants, but only thorny shrubs that bear no fruit or flower, and deadly weeds like hemlock; however, God then created trees that do bear fruit and plants that nourish and delight. And as the Evil One dug caves and chasms in the earth, God made the sun, the moon, and the stars; such was the work of the fourth day. On the fifth day, the beasts of earth, water, and sky were created. Now we come to the sixth day, and here I ask for your undivided attention.”",CO163CL10

With one breath God infused them each with a soul, and then, with another breath, he gave them all that is noble and pure in spirit. And divine mercy did not stop there; He caused a garden of delights to grow and led them into it, giving them dominion over everything within it. Both of them fell at the Lord’s feet, weeping tears of gratitude.",CO163CL10

Before God had instilled her with noble feelings, Eve had been planning to ensnare Adam in a trap, while Adam had felt an urge to beat her. Now, however, they were absorbed in peaceful contemplation of each other and the magnificent nature surrounding them. Never before had they known air so pure, water so fresh, or flowers so beautiful and fragrant; nor had the sun ever poured down in such torrents of light.",CO163CL10

Nor was it about the time – 8:15 p.m. – and anyway, the sky was clear and the moon was appearing.

No, they weren’t relatives, Brito answered; they were friends of a nephew who lived in Campinas, a terrible story . . . João das Mercês’s wide-open eyes heard these two words, and they said, without speaking, that they would come back to hear the rest – maybe that same night.

What remained was the anecdote, which I’m about to finish, so skimpy it was, an anecdote about nothing. It doesn’t matter. Whatever the size or importance, it was always a slice of life for the sexton, who helped the priest put away the holy bread, to take off his surplice, and do everything else before saying good-bye and leaving.

He had no thought of leaving early, no matter how afflicted the occasion became, and fortune helped him out. Brito was in the front room talking with his wife when they came to tell him that João das Mercês was asking about the state of the dying. The wife left the room, the sexton entered, asking pardon and saying it was for a short time; he was passing by and remembered to find out if the sick ones had gone to heaven, or if they were still of this world.

However, since the other was biting his lips and looking at the walls, he didn’t see the expression of expectation, and both remained silent. Brito ended up walking up and down the room while João das Mercês said to himself that it must be something more than fever.",CO208CL07
3562,28,"The first thought that came to him was whether the doctors had erred in the illness or the remedy. He also thought that it could be some other hidden problem that was called fever to hide the truth.

He noted to himself that it was the first time he had heard something about people absolutely unknown to him. Their faces, seen just a while ago, were the only sign of these people. Not even for that did he feel less curious. They were going to marry . . . It could be be that this was the terrible story.

The tears, he said, were for the nephew from Campinas and for a member of the dead woman’s family, who lived in Mata-Porcos It took the sexton but an instant to go from that to imagining that the commander’s nephew had liked the dying man’s fiancée, but the idea didn’t hold for long; it wasn’t forceful, and later, if he himself had accompanied them . . .",CO208CL07
3574,40,"Maybe he’d have been the best man at the wedding. He wanted to know, as was natural, the name of the dead woman.

The wife left the room, the sexton entered, asking pardon and saying it was for a short time; he was passing by and remembered to find out if the sick ones had gone to heaven, or if they were still of this world. He would listen with interest to everything said regarding the commander.",CO208CL11
3610,22,"“They haven’t died, nor do I even know if they will survive; she, at least, I think will die,” Brito concluded.",CO208CL11
3611,23,“They look pretty bad.”,CO208CL11
3612,24,"“She, mainly. She’s also the one suffering most from the fever. The fever hit them here in our house, just after they arrived from Campinas a few days ago.”",CO208CL11
3613,25,"“They were already here?” the sexton asked, astonished that he hadn’t known.",CO208CL11
3614,26,"“They were, for fifteen days, – or fourteen. They came with my nephew Carlos and caught the illness here...”",CO208CL11
3615,27,"Brito interrupted what he was saying, or so it seemed to the sexton, who put on his face the full look of someone waiting for the rest. However, since the other was biting his lips and looking at the walls, he didn’t see the expression of expectation, and both remained silent. Brito ended up walking up and down the room while João das Mercês said to himself that it must be something more than fever.",CO208CL11
3616,28,"The first thought that came to him was whether the doctors had erred in the illness or the remedy. He also thought that it could be some other hidden problem that was called fever to hide the truth. His eyes followed the commander as he walked back and forth all around the room, softening his footsteps so as not to bother the people inside anymore. From inside came whispered conversation, a call, a message, a door opening or closing.",CO208CL11
3617,29,"All of this would be nothing to anyone who was worried about something else, but our sexton now wanted nothing other than to know what he didn’t know. At least the sick people’s family, status, current state, some page of their life, anything that could be known no matter how far removed from the parish.",CO208CL11
3618,30,"“Ah!” Brito exclaimed, stopping short.",CO208CL11
3619,31,"He seemed to have an impatient urge to report an affair, – the “terrible story” he had mentioned to the sexton a little earlier. But he didn’t dare ask for it, nor did the other dare to tell it, and the commander took to pacing again.",CO208CL11
3620,32,"João das Mercês sat down. He saw perfectly well that the situation called for him to excuse himself with some good words of hope or comfort and to come back the next day. He preferred to sit and wait. He didn’t see any signs of disapproval on the other man’s face; to the contrary, he stopped in front of him and sighed with great weariness.",CO208CL11
3621,33,"“Sad, yes, sad,” João das Mercês agreed. “Good people, no?”",CO208CL11
3622,34,“They were going to get married.”,CO208CL11
3623,35,“Get married? They were engaged to each other?”,CO208CL11
3624,36,"Brito confirmed with a nod. The tone was disconsolate, but there was no sign of the terrible story, and the sexton waited for it. He noted to himself that it was the first time he had heard something about people absolutely unknown to him. Their faces, seen just a while ago, were the only sign of these people. Not even for that did he feel less curious. They were going to marry...It could be that this was the terrible story. In truth, hit by something bad on the eve of something good, the bad must have been terrible. Engaged and dying...",CO208CL11
3625,37,"They came to bring a message to the owner of the house, who asked the sexton to be excused so quickly that there was no time to say good-bye and leave. He ran into the house, and there he remained for fifty minutes. Finally he arrived at the room in suffocating tears; then, soon, the commander turned.",CO208CL11
3626,38,“What did I tell you just a while ago? At least she’s going to die. She died.”,CO208CL11
3627,39,"Brito said this without tears and almost without sadness. He’d known the dead woman a short time. The tears, he said, were for the nephew from Campinas and for a member of the dead woman’s family, who lived in Mata-Porcos It took the sexton but an instant to go from that to imagining that the commander’s nephew had liked the dying man’s fiancée, but the idea didn’t hold for long; it wasn’t forceful, and later, if he himself had accompanied them...",CO208CL11
3628,40,"Maybe he’d have been the best man at the wedding. He wanted to know, as was natural, the name of the dead woman. The owner of the house – either for not wanting to give it, or because he now had another idea in his head – did not state the name of the bride or the groom. It could have been both of those causes.",CO208CL11
3629,41,“They were going to marry...”,CO208CL11
3630,42,"“God will receive her into his holy care, and him, too, should he come to expire,” the sexton said, full of sorrow.",CO208CL11
3631,43,"And that word was enough to extract half the secret that seemed eager to leave the mouth of the supplier of ships. When João das Mercês saw the expression in his eyes, the movement with which he raised the window, and the request he made to swear – he swore by all his loved-one’s souls that he would listen to it all and not talk about it.",CO208CL11
3632,44,"He wasn’t a man to expose the confidentialities of others, much less those of people as noted and honored as the commander.  At which the commander said he was satisfied and enthused, and he then confided the first half of the secret, which was that the two lovers, raised together, had come here to get married when they heard, from a relative in Mata-porcos, abominable news...",CO208CL11
3633,45,"“And it was...?” João das Mercês hastened to say, sensing a certain hesitation in the commander.",CO208CL11
3634,46,“That they were brother and sister.”,CO208CL11
3635,47,“Brother and sister how? Really siblings?”,CO208CL11
3636,48,"“Really. Siblings on the part of the mother. It was the father who wasn’t the same. The relative didn’t tell them everything nor was clear about it but swore that’s the way it was, and they were thunderstruck for a day or more . . .”",CO208CL11
3637,49,"João das Mercês was no less shocked than they. He resolved not to leave until he knew the rest. He heard the clock strike ten, and he would hear all the other hours struck that night, would watch over the cadavers of one or both, as long as he could add this page to the other pages of the parish, even though it wasn’t of the parish.",CO208CL11
3638,50,"“Let’s go, let’s go, so it was the fever that took them...?”",CO208CL11
3639,51,"Brito clenched his teeth to not say any more. But when people came to call him inside the house, he responded quickly, and half an hour later he was back with the news of the second passing. The weeping, this time weaker in that it was more expected, now no longer having anyone to hide it from, delivered the news to the sexton.",CO208CL11
3640,52,"“There went the other, the brother, the groom... May God forgive them! Now you can know everything, my friend. Know that they wanted each other so much that a few days after learning of the natural and canonical obstacle to the union, they did some thinking and, satisfied that they were only step-siblings, not full siblings, they jumped into a cabriolet and fled from home. The alert soon went out, and we caught up with the cabriolet on the road to Cidade Nova, and they became so remorseful and ashamed with the capture that they took ill with fever and ended up dying.”",CO208CL11
3641,53,"What the sexton felt as he heard about this affair cannot be written. With difficulty he kept it to himself for a while. He learned the names of the people from the newspaper obituary, and he matched the circumstances he’d heard from the commander with others.",CO208CL11
3642,54,"In the end, without considering himself indiscreet, he spread the story,  but hiding the names and telling it to a friend, who passed it on to another, and he to others, and everyone to everyone. He did more. He got it into his head that the cabriolet they fled in was the same as that of the latest sacraments. He went to the coach house, chatted with an employee, found out yes. Which led to this page being called, “cabriolet anecdote.”",CO208CL11
3643,1,The Tale of the Cabriolet_26 Stories_eng,CO208CL12
3644,2,"“THE CABRIOLET’S HERE, sir,” said the slave who had been dispatched to the mother church of São José to summon the priest to give the last rites to not one but two individuals.",CO208CL12
3645,3,"Today’s generation witnessed neither the arrival nor the departure of the cabriolet in Rio de Janeiro. Nor will they know about the days when the cabriolet and the tilbury filled the role of carriage, public and private. The cabriolet did not last very long. The tilbury, which predates both, looks likely to last as long as the city does. When the city is dead and gone and the archaeologists arrive, they will find a skeletal tilbury waiting for its usual customer, complete with the skeletons of horse and driver.",CO208CL12
3646,4,"They will be just as patient as they are today, however much it rains, and more melancholy than ever, even if the sun shines, because they will combine both present-day melancholy with that of the spectral past. The archaeologist will doubtless have some strange things to say about the three skeletons. The cabriolet, on the other hand, had no history, and left only the tale I’m about to tell you.",CO208CL12
3647,5,“Two?” cried the sacristan.,CO208CL12
3648,6,"“Yes, sir, two: Senhora Anunciada and Senhor Pedrinho. Poor Senhor Pedrinho! And Senhora Anunciada, poor lady!” said the slave, moaning and groaning and pacing up and down, quite distraught.",CO208CL12
3649,7,"Anyone reading this with a darkly skeptical soul will inevitably ask if the slave was genuinely upset, or if he simply wanted to pique the curiosity of the priest and the sacristan. I’m of the view that anything is possible in this world and the next. I believe he was genuinely upset, but then again I don’t not believe that he was also eager to tell some terrible tale. However, neither the priest nor the sacristan asked him any questions.",CO208CL12
3650,8,"Not that the sacristan wasn’t curious. Indeed, he was more than curious. He knew the whole parish by heart; he knew the names of all the devout ladies, knew about their lives and those of their husbands and parents, their talents and resources, what they ate, drank, said, their clothes and their qualities, the dowries of the unmarried girls, the behavior of the married women, the sad longings of the widows. He poked his nose into everything, and, in between, helped at mass and so on. His name was João das Mercês, a man in his forties, thin, of medium height, and with a sparse, graying beard.",CO208CL12
3651,9,"“Which Pedrinho and Anunciada does he mean?” he wondered, as he accompanied the priest.",CO208CL12
3652,10,"He was burning to know, but the presence of the priest made any questions impossible. The priest walked to the door of the church so silently and piously that he felt obliged to be equally silent and pious. And off they went. The cabriolet was waiting for them; the driver doffed his hat, and the neighbors and a few passersby knelt down as priest and sacristan climbed into the vehicle and headed off down Rua da Misericórdia. The slave hurried back on foot.",CO208CL12
3653,11,"Donkeys and people wander the streets, clouds wander the sky, if there are any clouds, and thoughts wander people’s minds, if those minds have thoughts. The sacristan’s mind was filled with various thoughts, all of them rather confused. He was not thinking about Our Holy Father, although the sacristan knew how He should be worshipped, nor about the holy water and the hyssop he was carrying; nor was he thinking about the lateness of the hour—a quarter past eight at night—and, besides, the sky was clear and the moon was coming up. The cabriolet itself—which was new in the town, and had replaced, in this case, the chaise—even that did not occupy the whole of João das Mercês’s mind, or only the part that was preoccupied with Senhor Pedrinho and Senhora Anunciada.",CO208CL12
3654,12,"“They must be young people,” the sacristan was thinking, “staying as guests in someone’s house, because there are no empty houses to be had near the sea, and the number he gave us is Comendador Brito’s house. Relatives, perhaps? But I’ve never heard any mention of relatives. They could be friends or possibly mere acquaintances. But in that case why would they send a cabriolet? Even the slave is new to the house; he must belong to one of the two people who are dying, or to both.”",CO208CL12
3655,13,"Such were João das Mercês’s thoughts, although he didn’t have much time to think. The cabriolet stopped outside a two-story house, which was indeed the house of the comendador, José Martins de Brito. There were already a few people waiting outside, holding candles. The priest and the sacristan stepped out of the cabriolet and went up the stairs, accompanied by the comendador. On the landing above, his wife kissed the priest’s ring. Grown-ups, children, slaves, a murmur of voices, dim light, and the two people who were dying, each waiting in their respective rooms at the back.",CO208CL12
3656,14,"Everything happened as it always does on such occasions, according to rules and customs. Senhor Pedrinho was absolved and anointed, as was Senhora Anunciada, and the priest left the house to return to the church with the sacristan. The latter just had time to ask the comendador discreetly if the two were relatives of his. No, they weren’t, said Brito; they were friends of his nephew, who lived in Campinas; a terrible story. João de Mercês’s wide eyes drank in those three words and said, without actually speaking, that they would return to hear the rest—perhaps that same night. All this happened very quickly, because the priest was already going down the stairs, and he had to follow.",CO208CL12
3657,15,"The fashion for the cabriolet was so short-lived that this one probably never took another priest to administer the last rites to anyone else. All that remained was this brief, insubstantial tale, a mere bagatelle that I’ll have finished in no time. Not that its substance or lack of it mattered to the sacristan, for whom it was another welcome slice of life. He had to help the priest put away the Communion wafers, take off his surplice, and do various other things, before they could say good night and go their separate ways. When he was finally able to get away, he walked along by the shore as far as the comendador’s house.",CO208CL12
3658,16,"On the way, he reviewed the comendador’s life, before and after he had received that title. He began with his business—which was, I think, that of ship’s supplier—then moved on to his family, the parties he had given, the various parish, commercial, and electoral posts he had held, and it was only a step or two from that to sundry rumors and anecdotes. João das Mercês’s vast memory stored away every fact and incident, however large or small, so vividly that they might have happened yesterday, and so completely that not even the people involved could have recounted them in such detail.",CO208CL12
3659,17,"He knew these things as he knew the Our Father, that is, without having to think about the words—indeed, he would pray as if he were eating or chewing the prayer, which emerged unthinking from his mouth. If the rule was to say three dozen Our Fathers on the trot, João das Mercês would do so without even counting. So it was with other people’s lives; he loved knowing about them, finding out about them, and memorizing them so that he would never again forget them.",CO208CL12
3660,18,"Everyone in the parish loved him, because he never meddled or gossiped. With him it was a case of art for art’s sake. Often it wasn’t even necessary to ask any questions. José would tell him about Antônio’s life and Antônio about José’s life. What he did was ratify or rectify one version with the other, then compare their two versions with Sancho’s, then Sancho’s version with Martinho’s and vice versa, and so on and on.",CO208CL12
3661,19,"This is how he filled his empty hours, of which there were many. Occasionally, while at mass, he found himself thinking about some tale he had heard the previous evening, and the first time this happened, he asked God’s forgiveness, but immediately canceled this request when he realized that he had not missed a single word or gesture of the holy sacrament, so consubstantiate were they with him.",CO208CL12
3662,20,"The tale he had briefly relived was like a swallow flitting across a landscape. The landscape remains the same, and the water, if there is water, murmurs the same song. This comparison was of his own invention and was more fitting than he imagined, because the swallow, even when it’s flying, is part of the landscape, and the tale was part of him as a person; it was one of the ways in which he lived his life.",CO208CL12
3663,21,"By the time he had reached his destination, he had told every rosary bead of the comendador’s life, and he entered the house with his right foot first for luck. He had decided that, despite the sadness of the occasion, he would stay there for some time, and luck was on his side. Brito was in the front room, talking to his wife, when he was told that João das Mercês was asking after the two people who had received the last rites. His wife withdrew, and the sacristan entered, apologizing profusely and saying that he would not stay long. He had just been passing and wondered if they had already gone up into heaven or were still in this world. He was, naturally, interested in anything that affected the comendador.",CO208CL12
3664,22,"“No, they haven’t died, and may yet live, although I think it highly unlikely that she will survive,” said Brito.",CO208CL12
3665,23,“They both seemed to be in a very bad way.”,CO208CL12
3666,24,"“Oh, yes, especially her, because she’s the worst affected by the fever. They fell ill here, in our house, soon after they arrived from Campinas a few days ago.”",CO208CL12
3667,25,"“So they were already here?” asked the sacristan, astonished that he had known nothing of their arrival.",CO208CL12
3668,26,"“Yes, they arrived nearly two weeks ago. They came with my nephew Carlos, and caught the fever here—”",CO208CL12
3669,27,"Brito suddenly broke off, or so it seemed to the sacristan, who adopted the expression of someone eager to know more. Brito, however, sat for a moment biting his lip and staring at the wall, and did not notice the expectant look on the sacristan’s face, and so both sat on in silence. Brito ended up walking the length of the room, and João das Mercês thought to himself that there was clearly more to this than a mere fever.",CO208CL12
3670,28,"He wondered, at first, if perhaps the doctors had made a wrong diagnosis or prescribed the wrong medicine; or if there was some other concealed illness, which Brito was calling a fever in order to cover up the truth. He kept his eyes fixed on the comendador as he paced up and down the room, treading very softly so as not to disturb anyone else in the house. From within came the occasional faint murmur of conversation, a call, an order, a door opening or closing.",CO208CL12
3671,29,"None of this would have been of any importance to those with their minds on other things, but our sacristan had but one thought, to find out what he did not already know. At the very least, some information about the patients’ family, their social position, whether they were married or single, some page from their lives; anything was better than nothing, however removed it was from his own little parish.",CO208CL12
3672,30,"“Ah!” cried Brito, stopping his pacing.",CO208CL12
3673,31,"There seemed to be in him a great desire to recount something, the “terrible story” he had mentioned to the sacristan shortly before, but the sacristan did not dare ask him and the comendador, not daring to tell the sacristan, resumed his pacing.",CO208CL12
3674,32,"João das Mercês sat down. He knew that, in the circumstances, the polite thing would be to leave, proffering a few kind, hopeful, comforting words, and then to return the following day. He, however, preferred to sit and wait, and saw no sign of disapproval on the other man’s face; indeed, the comendador stopped pacing for a moment and stood before him, uttering a weary sigh.",CO208CL12
3675,33,"“Yes, it’s a very sad business,” said João das Mercês. “And they’re good people, too, I imagine.”",CO208CL12
3676,34,“They were going to be married.”,CO208CL12
3677,35,"“What, to each other?”",CO208CL12
3678,36,"Brito nodded in a melancholy way, but there was still no sign of the promised terrible story, for which the sacristan continued to wait. It occurred to him that this was the first time he had heard about the lives of people unknown to him. All he had seen of these people, shortly before, were their faces, but his curiosity was no less intense for that. They were going to be married. Perhaps that was the terrible story; to have fallen mortally ill on the eve of a new life, that was terrible indeed. About to be wed and about to die.",CO208CL12
3679,37,"Someone came to summon the comendador, and he excused himself so hurriedly that the sacristan had no time to take his leave. The comendador disappeared for about fifty minutes, at the end of which time the sacristan heard something like muffled sobbing coming from the next room. The comendador returned shortly afterward.",CO208CL12
3680,38,"“What was I saying just now? That she, at least, would die. Well, she’s dead.”",CO208CL12
3681,39,"Brito said this unemotionally, almost indifferently. He had not known the dead woman very long. The sobbing the sacristan had heard came from Brito’s nephew from Campinas and a relative of the dead woman who lived here in Mata-porcos. It took only an instant for the sacristan to imagine that the comendador’s nephew must have been in love with the dying man’s bride, but this idea proved short-lived, for the nephew had, after all, traveled to Rio with both of them.",CO208CL12
3682,40,"Perhaps he was to have been the best man. As was only natural and polite, he asked the name of the dead woman. However, either because he preferred not to say or because his thoughts were elsewhere—or perhaps for both those reasons—the comendador did not give her name, nor that of her fiancé.",CO208CL12
3683,41,“They were to be married . . .”,CO208CL12
3684,42,"“May God receive her and keep her safe, and him, too, if he should die,” said the sacristan sadly.",CO208CL12
3685,43,"And that was enough to draw forth half of the secret that seemed so eager to leave the comendador’s lips. When João das Mercês saw the look in his eyes, the gesture with which he beckoned him over to the window, and the promise he exacted from him, he swore on the souls of all his loved ones that he would listen and say nothing.",CO208CL12
3686,44,"He was not a man to divulge other people’s confidences, especially those of honorable persons of high rank like the comendador, who, satisfied with these assurances, finally plucked up the courage to tell him the first half of the secret, which was that the engaged couple, who had been brought up together, had come to Rio in order to get married, when that same relative from Mata-porcos had given them some dreadful news . . .",CO208CL12
3687,45,"“Which was?” João das Mercês prompted, sensing some hesitation on the part of the comendador.",CO208CL12
3688,46,“That they were brother and sister.”,CO208CL12
3689,47,“What do you mean? Blood relatives?”,CO208CL12
3690,48,"“Yes, they had the same mother, but different fathers. Their relative did not explain in detail, but she swore this was the truth, and for a day or more, they were both in a state of shock . . .”",CO208CL12
3691,49,"João das Mercês was no less shocked, but he nonetheless determined not to leave without hearing the rest of the story. He heard ten o’clock strike and was prepared to hear the clock chime throughout the night and to watch over the corpse of one or both, as long as he could add this page to his other parish pages, even though these people were not from the parish.",CO208CL12
3692,50,“So was that when they fell ill with the fever?”,CO208CL12
3693,51,"Brito clenched his jaw as if he would say nothing more. However, when he was once again summoned, he hurried off and returned half an hour later, with the news of the second death, news to which the sacristan had already been alerted by the sound of weeping, quieter this time, although not unexpected, since there was no one from whom it needed to be concealed.",CO208CL12
3694,52,"“The brother, or bridegroom, has just passed away too. May God forgive them! I’ll tell you the whole story now, my friend. They loved each other so much that, a few days after learning of the natural and canonical impediment to their marriage, they decided that, since they were only half-siblings, they would elope, and they fled in a cabriolet. The alarm was given, and the cabriolet was stopped on its way to Cidade Nova. They, however, were so distraught and angry at being captured that they both fell ill with the fever from which they have now died.”",CO208CL12
3695,53,"It is impossible to describe the sacristan’s feelings when he heard this tale. He managed, with some difficulty, to keep it to himself for a while. He found out the names of the couple from the obituary in the newspaper, and supplemented the details the comendador had given him with others.",CO208CL12
3696,54,"In the end, without feeling he was being indiscreet, he divulged the story—without naming names—to a friend, who told it to another, who told it to another, and so on and so forth. More than that, he got it into his head that the cabriolet in which the couple had attempted to elope could well have been the same one that had carried him and the priest to offer them the last rites; he went to the coach house, chatted to an employee, and discovered that it was indeed the same one, which is why this story is called “the tale of the cabriolet.”",CO208CL12

The cabriolet was waiting for them; the driver doffed his hat, and the neighbors and a few passersby knelt down as priest and sacristan climbed into the vehicle and headed off down Rua da Misericórdia. The slave hurried back on foot.",CO208CL10
3707,11,"Donkeys and people wander the streets, clouds wander the sky, if there are any clouds, and thoughts wander people’s minds, if those minds have thoughts. The sacristan’s mind was filled with various thoughts, all of them rather confused. He was not thinking about Our Holy Father, although the sacristan knew how He should be worshipped, nor about the holy water and the hyssop he was carrying; nor was he thinking about the lateness of the hour—a quarter past eight at night—and, besides, the sky was clear and the moon was coming up. The cabriolet itself—which was new in the town, and had replaced, in this case, the chaise—even that did not occupy the whole of João das Mercês’s mind, or only the part that was preoccupied with Senhor Pedrinho and Senhora Anunciada.",CO208CL10
3708,12,"“They must be young people,” the sacristan was thinking, “staying as guests in someone’s house, because there are no empty houses to be had near the sea, and the number he gave us is Comendador Brito’s house. Relatives, perhaps? But I’ve never heard any mention of relatives. They could be friends or possibly mere acquaintances. But in that case why would they send a cabriolet? Even the slave is new to the house; he must belong to one of the two people who are dying, or to both.”",CO208CL10
3709,13,"Such were João das Mercês’s thoughts, although he didn’t have much time to think. The cabriolet stopped outside a two-story house, which was indeed the house of the comendador, José Martins de Brito. There were already a few people waiting outside, holding candles. The priest and the sacristan stepped out of the cabriolet and went up the stairs, accompanied by the comendador. On the landing above, his wife kissed the priest’s ring. Grown-ups, children, slaves, a murmur of voices, dim light, and the two people who were dying, each waiting in their respective rooms at the back.",CO208CL10
3710,14,"Everything happened as it always does on such occasions, according to rules and customs. Senhor Pedrinho was absolved and anointed, as was Senhora Anunciada, and the priest left the house to return to the church with the sacristan. The latter just had time to ask the comendador discreetly if the two were relatives of his. No, they weren’t, said Brito; they were friends of his nephew, who lived in Campinas; a terrible story. João de Mercês’s wide eyes drank in those three words and said, without actually speaking, that they would return to hear the rest—perhaps that same night. All this happened very quickly, because the priest was already going down the stairs, and he had to follow.",CO208CL10
3711,15,"The fashion for the cabriolet was so short-lived that this one probably never took another priest to administer the last rites to anyone else. All that remained was this brief, insubstantial tale, a mere bagatelle that I’ll have finished in no time. Not that its substance or lack of it mattered to the sacristan, for whom it was another welcome slice of life. He had to help the priest put away the Communion wafers, take off his surplice, and do various other things, before they could say good night and go their separate ways. When he was finally able to get away, he walked along by the shore as far as the comendador’s house.",CO208CL10
3712,16,"On the way, he reviewed the comendador’s life, before and after he had received that title. He began with his business—which was, I think, that of ship’s supplier—then moved on to his family, the parties he had given, the various parish, commercial, and electoral posts he had held, and it was only a step or two from that to sundry rumors and anecdotes. João das Mercês’s vast memory stored away every fact and incident, however large or small, so vividly that they might have happened yesterday, and so completely that not even the people involved could have recounted them in such detail.",CO208CL10
3713,17,"He knew these things as he knew the Our Father, that is, without having to think about the words—indeed, he would pray as if he were eating or chewing the prayer, which emerged unthinking from his mouth. If the rule was to say three dozen Our Fathers on the trot, João das Mercês would do so without even counting. So it was with other people’s lives; he loved knowing about them, finding out about them, and memorizing them so that he would never again forget them.",CO208CL10
3714,18,"Everyone in the parish loved him, because he never meddled or gossiped. With him it was a case of art for art’s sake. Often it wasn’t even necessary to ask any questions. José would tell him about Antônio’s life and Antônio about José’s life. What he did was ratify or rectify one version with the other, then compare their two versions with Sancho’s, then Sancho’s version with Martinho’s and vice versa, and so on and on.",CO208CL10
3715,19,"This is how he filled his empty hours, of which there were many. Occasionally, while at mass, he found himself thinking about some tale he had heard the previous evening, and the first time this happened, he asked God’s forgiveness, but immediately canceled this request when he realized that he had not missed a single word or gesture of the holy sacrament, so consubstantiate were they with him.",CO208CL10
3716,20,"The tale he had briefly relived was like a swallow flitting across a landscape. The landscape remains the same, and the water, if there is water, murmurs the same song. This comparison was of his own invention and was more fitting than he imagined, because the swallow, even when it’s flying, is part of the landscape, and the tale was part of him as a person; it was one of the ways in which he lived his life.",CO208CL10
3717,21,"By the time he had reached his destination, he had told every rosary bead of the comendador’s life, and he entered the house with his right foot first for luck. He had decided that, despite the sadness of the occasion, he would stay there for some time, and luck was on his side. Brito was in the front room, talking to his wife, when he was told that João das Mercês was asking after the two people who had received the last rites. His wife withdrew, and the sacristan entered, apologizing profusely and saying that he would not stay long. He had just been passing and wondered if they had already gone up into heaven or were still in this world. He was, naturally, interested in anything that affected the comendador.",CO208CL10
3718,22,"“No, they haven’t died, and may yet live, although I think it highly unlikely that she will survive,” said Brito.",CO208CL10
3719,23,“They both seemed to be in a very bad way.”,CO208CL10
3720,24,"“Oh, yes, especially her, because she’s the worst affected by the fever. They fell ill here, in our house, soon after they arrived from Campinas a few days ago.”",CO208CL10
3721,25,"“So they were already here?” asked the sacristan, astonished that he had known nothing of their arrival.",CO208CL10
3722,26,"“Yes, they arrived nearly two weeks ago. They came with my nephew Carlos, and caught the fever here—”",CO208CL10
3723,27,"Brito suddenly broke off, or so it seemed to the sacristan, who adopted the expression of someone eager to know more. Brito, however, sat for a moment biting his lip and staring at the wall, and did not notice the expectant look on the sacristan’s face, and so both sat on in silence. Brito ended up walking the length of the room, and João das Mercês thought to himself that there was clearly more to this than a mere fever.",CO208CL10
3724,28,"He wondered, at first, if perhaps the doctors had made a wrong diagnosis or prescribed the wrong medicine; or if there was some other concealed illness, which Brito was calling a fever in order to cover up the truth. He kept his eyes fixed on the comendador as he paced up and down the room, treading very softly so as not to disturb anyone else in the house. From within came the occasional faint murmur of conversation, a call, an order, a door opening or closing.",CO208CL10
3725,29,"None of this would have been of any importance to those with their minds on other things, but our sacristan had but one thought, to find out what he did not already know. At the very least, some information about the patients’ family, their social position, whether they were married or single, some page from their lives; anything was better than nothing, however removed it was from his own little parish.",CO208CL10
3726,30,"“Ah!” cried Brito, stopping his pacing.",CO208CL10
3727,31,"There seemed to be in him a great desire to recount something, the “terrible story” he had mentioned to the sacristan shortly before, but the sacristan did not dare ask him and the comendador, not daring to tell the sacristan, resumed his pacing.",CO208CL10
3728,32,"João das Mercês sat down. He knew that, in the circumstances, the polite thing would be to leave, proffering a few kind, hopeful, comforting words, and then to return the following day. He, however, preferred to sit and wait, and saw no sign of disapproval on the other man’s face; indeed, the comendador stopped pacing for a moment and stood before him, uttering a weary sigh.",CO208CL10
3729,33,"“Yes, it’s a very sad business,” said João das Mercês. “And they’re good people, too, I imagine.”",CO208CL10
3730,34,“They were going to be married.”,CO208CL10
3731,35,"“What, to each other?”",CO208CL10
3732,36,"Brito nodded in a melancholy way, but there was still no sign of the promised terrible story, for which the sacristan continued to wait. It occurred to him that this was the first time he had heard about the lives of people unknown to him. All he had seen of these people, shortly before, were their faces, but his curiosity was no less intense for that. They were going to be married. Perhaps that was the terrible story; to have fallen mortally ill on the eve of a new life, that was terrible indeed. About to be wed and about to die.",CO208CL10
3733,37,"Someone came to summon the comendador, and he excused himself so hurriedly that the sacristan had no time to take his leave. The comendador disappeared for about fifty minutes, at the end of which time the sacristan heard something like muffled sobbing coming from the next room. The comendador returned shortly afterward.",CO208CL10
3734,38,"“What was I saying just now? That she, at least, would die. Well, she’s dead.”",CO208CL10
3735,39,"Brito said this unemotionally, almost indifferently. He had not known the dead woman very long. The sobbing the sacristan had heard came from Brito’s nephew from Campinas and a relative of the dead woman who lived here in Mata-porcos. It took only an instant for the sacristan to imagine that the comendador’s nephew must have been in love with the dying man’s bride, but this idea proved short-lived, for the nephew had, after all, traveled to Rio with both of them.",CO208CL10
3736,40,"Perhaps he was to have been the best man. As was only natural and polite, he asked the name of the dead woman. However, either because he preferred not to say or because his thoughts were elsewhere—or perhaps for both those reasons—the comendador did not give her name, nor that of her fiancé.",CO208CL10
3737,41,“They were to be married . . .”,CO208CL10
3738,42,"“May God receive her and keep her safe, and him, too, if he should die,” said the sacristan sadly.",CO208CL10
3739,43,"And that was enough to draw forth half of the secret that seemed so eager to leave the comendador’s lips. When João das Mercês saw the look in his eyes, the gesture with which he beckoned him over to the window, and the promise he exacted from him, he swore on the souls of all his loved ones that he would listen and say nothing.",CO208CL10
3740,44,"He was not a man to divulge other people’s confidences, especially those of honorable persons of high rank like the comendador, who, satisfied with these assurances, finally plucked up the courage to tell him the first half of the secret, which was that the engaged couple, who had been brought up together, had come to Rio in order to get married, when that same relative from Mata-porcos had given them some dreadful news . . .",CO208CL10
3741,45,"“Which was?” João das Mercês prompted, sensing some hesitation on the part of the comendador.",CO208CL10
3742,46,“That they were brother and sister.”,CO208CL10
3743,47,“What do you mean? Blood relatives?”,CO208CL10
3744,48,"“Yes, they had the same mother, but different fathers. Their relative did not explain in detail, but she swore this was the truth, and for a day or more, they were both in a state of shock . . .”",CO208CL10
3745,49,"João das Mercês was no less shocked, but he nonetheless determined not to leave without hearing the rest of the story. He heard ten o’clock strike and was prepared to hear the clock chime throughout the night and to watch over the corpse of one or both, as long as he could add this page to his other parish pages, even though these people were not from the parish.",CO208CL10
3746,50,“So was that when they fell ill with the fever?”,CO208CL10
3747,51,"Brito clenched his jaw as if he would say nothing more. However, when he was once again summoned, he hurried off and returned half an hour later, with the news of the second death, news to which the sacristan had already been alerted by the sound of weeping, quieter this time, although not unexpected, since there was no one from whom it needed to be concealed.",CO208CL10
3748,52,"“The brother, or bridegroom, has just passed away too. May God forgive them! I’ll tell you the whole story now, my friend. They loved each other so much that, a few days after learning of the natural and canonical impediment to their marriage, they decided that, since they were only half-siblings, they would elope, and they fled in a cabriolet. The alarm was given, and the cabriolet was stopped on its way to Cidade Nova. They, however, were so distraught and angry at being captured that they both fell ill with the fever from which they have now died.”",CO208CL10
3749,53,"It is impossible to describe the sacristan’s feelings when he heard this tale. He managed, with some difficulty, to keep it to himself for a while. He found out the names of the couple from the obituary in the newspaper, and supplemented the details the comendador had given him with others.",CO208CL10
3750,54,"In the end, without feeling he was being indiscreet, he divulged the story—without naming names—to a friend, who told it to another, who told it to another, and so on and so forth. More than that, he got it into his head that the cabriolet in which the couple had attempted to elope could well have been the same one that had carried him and the priest to offer them the last rites; he went to the coach house, chatted to an employee, and discovered that it was indeed the same one, which is why this story is called “the tale of the cabriolet.”",CO208CL10

3752,2,"My man, his name is Falcon. That day – the fourteenth of April of 1870 – if you were to enter his house, at ten at night, you would see him pacing through the room, in shirt sleeves, black pants, and a white tie, grumbling, gesturing, sighing, evidently afflicted. From time to time he sat down; other times, he leaned against the window, looking towards the beach, which was that of Gamboa. But, wherever the place or whatever the mood, he wasted little time.",CO117CL07

Meanwhile, it is enough to see his feline gaze, his two lips, masters of calculation, that, even when closed, seem to be counting something, to immediately guess that our man’s principle trait is his voraciousness for profit. Let us understand though: he does art for art’s sake, he does not love money for what it can give, but for what it is in itself!",CO117CL07
3755,5,"No one is going to speak to him of the gifts of life. He does not have a soft bed, nor fine table, nor coach, nor aristocratic title. Money is not earned in order to be squandered, he says. He lives off crumbs; all that accumulates is for contemplation. He often goes to his safe, which is in his sleeping alcove, with the sole goal of fixing his eyes upon rolls of gold and bundles of deeds. Other times, through a refined pecuniary eroticism, he just contemplates them from memory. Regarding this particular detail, all that I could say would not live up to his own words, in 1857.",CO117CL07
3756,6,"By then already a millionaire, or almost, he ran into two boys in the street, his familiars, who asked him if a note of five thousand réis that their uncle had given them was real.

He took the note tremulously, examined it closely, turned it one way and the other…",CO117CL07

What other motive could lead him to stop, in front of exchange windows, five, ten, fifteen minutes, tasting with his eyes the piles of pounds and francs so neatly stacked and yellowed? Or even the surprise with which he took the note of five thousand réis, it was a subtle trait, the terror of a false note. He hated nothing more than false currency, not for being criminal but for being prejudicial, for demoralizing good money.",CO117CL07

But the years passed, and at forty-five years he began to feel a certain moral necessity, which he didn’t understand right away, that was a paternal longing. Not a wife, not kin, but a son or a daughter, were he to have one, would be like receiving a big gold pataca coin. Unfortunately, this other capital ought to be accumulated over time; he could not begin to earn it so late. All that remained was the lottery; and with the lottery he won the grand prize.",CO117CL07

When he was losing, there fell upon his face an incurable dejection, and he withdrew little by little into silence.

3802,52,"“I never was one for windows,” she said, “and I think it awful that a lady concern herself with matters of the street.”",CO117CL07
3803,53,"Another caution of Falcon’s was to not bring partners to the house except for those older than fifty or married. In sum, he did not care anymore about the fall of stocks. And all of this was unnecessary because the niece did not really care about anything except him and the house. Sometimes, since the uncle’s sight was beginning to diminish a lot, she read to him some pages from Saint-Clair das Ilhas.",CO117CL07
3804,54,"To make do without partners, when they were lacking, she learned to play cards, and, understanding that her uncle liked to win, she always let herself lose. She went even further: when she was losing a lot, she pretended to be angry or sad, with the singular goal of giving the uncle a gain in pleasure. He then laughed at length, made fun of her, telling her she had a big nose, and asked for a handkerchief to dry her tears; but he did not stop counting his tentos every ten minutes, and if one fell on the floor (they were grains/kernels of corn) he lowered the candle to pick it up.",CO117CL07
3805,55,"At the end of three months, Falcon fell ill. The nuisance was not serious nor long; but the terror of death took hold of his spirit, and it was then that one could see all of the affection he had for the girl. Every visitor that came to him was received harshly, or at least dryly.",CO117CL07
3806,56,"Those closest to him suffered the most because he told them brutally that he was not yet a corpse, that his flesh was still alive, that the vultures were fooled by the scent, etc. But Virginia never found him in a single instant of bad humor. Falcon obeyed her in everything, with the passiveness of a child, and, when he laughed, it was because she made him laugh.",CO117CL07
3807,57,"“Come on, take the medicine, stop doing this, you, sir, are now my child…”",CO117CL07
3808,58,"Falcon smiled and drank the medicine. She sat at the foot of the bed, telling him stories; she glanced at the clock in order to give him soups or chicken, she read him the timeless Saint-Clair. Then came convalescence. Falcon went out on some walks, accompanied by Virginia. The prudence with which she, giving him her arm, went looking at the rocks in the road, with the fear of facing the eyes of some man, delighted Falcon.",CO117CL07
3809,59,"“She will be the one who shuts my eyes,” he repeated to himself. One day, he came to think it out loud: “Isn’t it true that you will have to shut my eyes for me?”",CO117CL07
3810,60,“Don’t speak such nonsense!”,CO117CL07
3811,61,"Although he was in the street, he stopped, held her hands tightly in his, grateful, not finding anything to say. If he had had the ability to cry, he probably would have been left with teary eyes. Arriving home, Virginia ran to her room to reread a letter that Dona Bernarda, a friend of her mother, had given her in the afternoon. It was postmarked from New York and bore as the only signature this name: Reginald. One of the lines said the following:",CO117CL07
3812,62,"“I leave from here on the steamship on the 25th. Wait for me without fail. I still don’t know if I will see you later or not. Your uncle ought to remember me; he saw me in the house of my uncle, Chico Borges, on the day of your cousin’s wedding…”",CO117CL07
3813,63,"Forty days later, this Reginald disembarked, coming from New York, with thirty years under his belt and three hundred thousand dollars in his pocket. Twenty-four hours later he visited Falcon, who received him with mere politeness. But Reginald was fine and practical; he struck the principal chord of the man, and it resounded. He told him of the business prodigies in the United States, the hordes of money that flowed across the oceans.",CO117CL07
3814,64,"Falcon listened, fascinated, and asked for more details. Then the other made for him an extensive computation of companies and banks, stocks, balances of public budgets, individual wealth, municipal revenue of New York; he described to him the grand palaces of commerce…",CO117CL07
3815,65,"“Really, it is a great country,” said Falcon, from time to time. And after three minutes of reflection: “But, from what you, sir, tell me, there is only gold?”",CO117CL07
3816,66,"“Only gold, no; there is a lot of silver and paper; but there paper and gold are the same thing. And money from other nations? I must show you a collection that I’ve brought. Look; in order to see what this is, it suffices to look at me. I went over there poor, twenty-two years old; at the end of seven years, I have six hundred contos.",CO117CL07
3817,67,Falcon shuddered:,CO117CL07
3818,68,"“I, with your age, he confessed, would hardly arrive at one hundred.”",CO117CL07
3819,69,He was captivated. Reginald told him that he would need two or three weeks to tell him the miracles of the dollar.,CO117CL07

3821,71,“Dollar.”,CO117CL07
3822,72,“You might not believe that I have never seen this currency.”,CO117CL07
3823,73,"Reginald took one out from his vest pocket and showed it to him. Falcon, before putting his hand on it, grabbed it with his eyes. As it was a little dark, he stood up and went to the window to examine the dollar closely – both of the sides; afterward he returned it, giving much praise to the design and stamping and adding that our old patacões were quite pretty.",CO117CL07
3824,74,"The visits repeated. Reginald assented to asking the girl’s hand. She, however, told him that it was necessary to first earn her uncle’s blessing; she would not marry against his will. Reginald was not discouraged. He redoubled his attentions; he overwhelmed the uncle with fabulous dividends.",CO117CL07
3825,75,"“By the way, you, sir, have never showed me your collection of coins,” Falcon said to him one day.",CO117CL07
3826,76,“Come to my house tomorrow.”,CO117CL07
3827,77,"Falcon went. Reginald showed him the collection stored in a case with glass on all sides. Falcon’s surprise was extraordinary; he expected a box with an example of every coin, and he found mounds of gold, silver, bronze, and copper. Falcon looked at them with a universal and collective eye; then he began to look at them closely. He only knew pounds, dollars, and francs; but Reginald named all of them: florins, coroas, rublos, dracmas, piastras, pesos, rúpias, all the numismatics of his job, he concluded poetically.",CO117CL07
3828,78,“But what patience you have to collect all of this!” he said.,CO117CL07
3829,79,"“It was not I who collected it,” replied Reginald. “The collection belonged to the estate of a subject in Philadelphia. It cost me a trifle – five thousand dollars.”",CO117CL07
3830,80,"In truth, it was worth more. Falcon left with the collection in his soul; he spoke of it to the niece, and, in his imagination, he unordered and reordered all of the coins, like a lover tousles his lover’s hair in order to touch her up again. At night he dreamed that he was a florin, that a player laid him on the lansquenet table, and that he had brought with him more than two hundred florins for the player’s pocket. In the morning, to comfort himself, he went to contemplate the coins that he had in the coffer; but nothing consoled him. The best of possessions is what one does not himself possess.",CO117CL07
3831,81,"Some days on, at home, in his living room, he seemed to see money on the floor. He bent over to pick it up; it was not a bill, it was a simple letter. He distractedly opened the letter and read it with horror: it was from Reginald to Virginia…",CO117CL07
3832,82,"“Enough!” the reader interrupts me; “I can guess the rest. Virginia married Reginald, and the coins passed into the hands of Falcon, and they were false…”",CO117CL07
3833,83,"No, sir, they were real. It would be more moral if, for the punishment of our man, they were false; but, woe is me! I am not Seneca, nor do I pass for Suetonius, who would tell the death of Caesar ten times, if he were to be resuscitated ten times, since he would not come back to life if not to return to the empire.",CO117CL07

3835,2,"THE MAN IN QUESTION is called Falcão. On that day—April 14, 1870—anyone who came into his house, at ten o’clock at night, would have seen him pacing up and down the parlor in his shirtsleeves, black pants, and white necktie, muttering, gesticulating, and sighing to himself, evidently greatly troubled. At times, he would sit, or stop and lean against the window, looking out at the shoreline in Gamboa. But whichever position or pose he adopted, he didn’t maintain it for very long.",CO117CL10
3836,3,"“It was wrong of me,” he kept saying, “very wrong of me. She was always so kind to me! Such a sweet, loving creature! She was crying, poor thing! It was wrong of me, very wrong . . . Well, I hope she may at least be happy!”",CO117CL10
3837,4,"If I were to tell you that this man had sold one of his nieces, you would not believe me. If I were to go so far as to state the price, ten contos de réis, you would turn your back on me in scorn and indignation. And yet it is enough to see his feline gaze and his two lips—those masters of calculation that seemed to be counting something even when they were closed—to guess immediately that our fellow’s principal characteristic is his voracious appetite for profit. Let us be perfectly clear: he believes in art for art’s sake; he does not love money for what it can give, but for what it intrinsically is.",CO117CL10
3838,5,"No one can interest him in the pleasures of life. He has neither soft bed nor fine table, neither carriage nor grandiose titles. “Money isn’t earned to be squandered,” he says. He lives on crumbs; everything he accumulates is for his private contemplation. He often goes to check his safe, which he keeps in his bedroom, with the sole purpose of feasting his eyes on the neat stacks of gold coins and bundles of stocks and shares. At other times, out of a refined sense of pecuniary eroticism, he contemplates them from memory alone. In this regard, I can do no more than quote the man himself, in 1857.",CO117CL10
3839,6,"By then already a millionaire, or almost, he encountered two boys in the street, who were well known to him and who asked him whether a five-mil-réis note their uncle had given them was genuine. There were some counterfeit banknotes circulating at the time, and the boys had remembered this on their way home. Falcão was with a friend of his. He took the note, trembling, and examined it carefully, turning it this way and that.",CO117CL10

3842,9,"“Give it here,” said both boys.",CO117CL10

3844,11,"“It’s always a pleasure to see money, even when it’s not your own.”",CO117CL10
3845,12,"This was how much he loved money, even in disinterested contemplation. What other motive could have brought him to linger outside the money changers’ windows for five, ten, or even fifteen minutes, salivating over the piles of sovereigns and francs, so neatly stacked and yellow? His shiver of alarm upon touching the five-mil-réis note was but a subtle manifestation of his abiding fear of fake banknotes. Nothing upset him as much as counterfeiters, not because they were criminals, but because of their detrimental and demoralizing effect on the genuine article.",CO117CL10
3846,13,"Falcão’s own words merit close study. So it is that one day, in 1864, returning from a friend’s funeral and describing the splendor of the procession, he exclaimed enthusiastically:",CO117CL10
3847,14,"“There were three thousand contos carrying the coffin!” And, as one of the bystanders didn’t immediately understand what he meant, Falcão assumed in astonishment that the man did not believe him, and itemized the pallbearers as follows:",CO117CL10
3848,15,"“You-know-who at the front is worth four hundred; the fellow beside him, six hundred. Yes, six hundred, mark my words; when he wound up that business with his father-in-law two years ago, it was worth more than five hundred, but let’s call it five . . .”",CO117CL10
3849,16,"And on he went, adding them up one by one and concluding: “Three thousand contos exactly!”",CO117CL10
3850,17,"He was not married. To marry was to throw money away. But the years passed, and, at forty-five, he began to feel a certain moral necessity, which he did not immediately understand, for that need was the longing to be a father. He didn’t want a wife or relatives, mind you, but to have a son or daughter would be like receiving a precious gold coin. Unfortunately, this other kind of capital should have been accumulated a long time ago, and it was too late to start earning it now. All that remained was the lottery, and the lottery brought him the grand prize.",CO117CL10
3851,18,"His brother died and then, three months later, so did his sister-in-law, leaving an eleven-year-old daughter. He was very fond both of this niece and another one, the daughter of a widowed sister; he bestowed kisses on them when he visited, and his enthusiasm even stretched, on several occasions, to taking them some cookies. He hesitated somewhat, but, finally, he took in the orphan; she was the daughter he had always wanted. He could scarcely contain his happiness; for the first few weeks, he barely left the house and was always at her side, listening to her stories and silliness.",CO117CL10
3852,19,"Her name was Jacinta. She wasn’t pretty, but she had a melodious voice and a gentle manner. She could already read and write, and was starting to learn music. Her piano came with her along with what she had learned and a few exercises; she couldn’t bring her piano teacher, for her uncle thought it better to carry on practicing what she knew already, and one day, perhaps later . . .",CO117CL10
3853,20,"Eleven, twelve, thirteen—every year that passed was another tie that bound the old bachelor to his adopted daughter, and vice versa. At thirteen, Jacinta was running the household; by seventeen she was its true mistress. She did not abuse her power; she was naturally modest, frugal, and thrifty.",CO117CL10
3854,21,“An angel!” said Falcão to Chico Borges.,CO117CL10
3855,22,"This Chico Borges fellow was forty years old and owned a warehouse. He played cards with Falcão in the evenings. Jacinta accompanied them when they played. By then she was eighteen; she was no prettier, but everyone said that she was “improving with age.” She was petite, and the warehouse owner liked petite women. They wrote to each other, and courtship turned to passion.",CO117CL10
3856,23,"“Right, let’s get down to it,” said Chico Borges as he entered the room one evening, shortly after dusk.",CO117CL10
3857,24,"The card games were the two lovers’ discreet parasol. The two men didn’t play for real money, but Falcão had such a thirst for profit that he drooled over his worthless counters, and totted them up every ten minutes, just to see if he was winning or losing. When he was losing, a terrible look of dejection would come over his face, and he would withdraw into silence. If bad luck continued to pursue him, he would stop the game and rise to his feet, so absorbed in his own melancholy that his niece and Chico Borges could clasp each other’s hand once, twice, or even three times, without him even noticing.",CO117CL10
3858,25,"This was in 1869. At the beginning of 1870, Falcão offered to sell some shares to Chico Borges. He didn’t yet own the shares, but his nose told him the stock market was about to crash, and he reckoned he could make thirty to forty contos from Chico Borges in one go. The latter replied delicately that he had been thinking of making the very same proposal to Falcão. Since they both wished to sell and neither wished to buy, why didn’t they club together and offer to sell to a third party?",CO117CL10
3859,26,"They found just such a third party, and signed the contract with sixty days for delivery. On their way home from closing the deal, Falcão was in such good spirits that his partner opened his heart to him and asked for Jacinta’s hand. Falcão stopped in his tracks, as stunned and bewildered as if Borges had suddenly started speaking Turkish. Hand over his niece? But . . .",CO117CL10

3863,30,“I will not think about it; I will not have it.”,CO117CL10
3864,31,"He arrived home feeling angry and afraid. His niece cajoled him into telling her what was the matter, and he ended up telling her everything, even calling her thoughtless and ungrateful. Jacinta turned pale; she loved both her uncle and Chico Borges, and thought them such good friends that she had never imagined this clash of affections.",CO117CL10
3865,32,"In her bedroom she wept profusely; then she wrote a letter to Chico Borges, begging him, for the love of Christ and His five Holy Wounds, that he neither make a fuss nor fight with her uncle; she told him she would wait, and swore eternal love.",CO117CL10
3866,33,"The two friends did not fight, but Borges’s visits naturally became fewer and chillier. Jacinta did not come down to the parlor, or else withdrew quickly. Falcão was petrified. He loved his niece with a dog-like devotion, the kind of dog that snaps at the heels of strangers. He wanted her for himself, not as a man, but as a father.",CO117CL10
3867,34,"Natural fatherhood provides its own strength for the sacrifice of separation, but his fatherhood was on loan, and, perhaps for that very reason, more selfish.  He had never considered losing her; now, however, he took endless precautions: closing the shutters, warning the servants, mounting a perpetual vigil, spying on her every word and deed; in other words, a campaign worthy of Don Bartolo in The Barber of Seville.",CO117CL10
3868,35,"Meanwhile, the sun, that model of public officialdom, continued punctually to serve the passing days, one by one, until the two-month period for delivery of the shares was up. By then the share price should have gone down, but, like lotteries and wars, the stock market scorns human calculations.",CO117CL10
3869,36,"In this particular case, scorn was met by cruelty, for the price neither fell nor stayed the same; it rose to such an extent that the expected profit of forty contos became a loss of twenty.",CO117CL10
3870,37,"It was at this point that Chico Borges had an ingenious idea. That evening, while Falcão paced the room in silent, dejected disappointment, Chico Borges proposed that he would finance the whole of the shortfall if Falcão gave him his niece. Falcão was dumbstruck.",CO117CL10

3873,40,"“No, certainly not.”",CO117CL10
3874,41,"He would not hear of it, and refused three or four times. His first reaction had been one of happiness at the ten contos he would save, but the idea of being parted from Jacinta was unbearable, and so he refused. He slept badly. In the morning, he reviewed the situation, and, weighing up all the factors, concluded that, in handing Jacinta over to Chico Borges, he wouldn’t be losing her entirely, whereas if he didn’t, the ten contos would be irretrievably lost.",CO117CL10
3875,42,"Furthermore, if she liked him and he liked her, who was he to keep them apart? All daughters get married, and their fathers content themselves with seeing them happy. He hurried over to Chico Borges’s house, and they reached an agreement.",CO117CL10

Jacinta did not just treat him to a good lunch, she showered him with love and affection, but neither her affection nor the lunch restored his spirits. On the contrary, the newlyweds’ happiness made him sadder still.",CO117CL10
3878,45,"When he returned to his own house he felt lost without Jacinta’s gentle face. Never again would he hear her girlish songs; no longer would it be Jacinta who made his tea, nor, at night, when he wanted to read, would she be the one to bring him his well-thumbed old copy of St. Clair of the Isles, a gift from 1850.",CO117CL10

By this time, Falcão was fifty-four.",CO117CL10
3881,48,"He was reconciled to Jacinta’s marriage and had even planned to go and live with them, either at no cost to himself or by making some small contribution, which, he had calculated, would still be far more economical than living alone. All these plans now crumbled into dust; there he was, back in the same situation as eight years before, with the difference that fate had snatched the cup away from him between sips.",CO117CL10
3882,49,"Then, suddenly, another niece landed upon him. This was the daughter of his widowed sister, who, on her deathbed, had asked him to take care of her daughter. Falcão promised nothing, because a certain instinct told him not to promise anything to anyone, but he did in fact take in his niece, no sooner than his sister’s body was cold. There was no reticence on his part; on the contrary, he opened the doors of his house to her with a feverish excitement, and almost gave thanks to God for his sister’s death. Once again, here was the daughter he had never had.",CO117CL10

3884,51,"It wasn’t easy. Virgínia was eighteen, a genuinely original beauty; she was both tall and attractive.

Virgínia didn’t seem bothered.",CO117CL10
3885,52,"“I was never one for gazing out of windows,” she would say, “and I think it’s hardly becoming for a young lady to spend all her time wandering the streets.”",CO117CL10
3886,53,"Another of Falcão’s precautions was never to bring card players to the house unless they were over fifty or married. In short, he stopped caring about falls in the stock market. But all of this proved unnecessary, because Virgínia didn’t really care for anything except him and the house. Sometimes, as her uncle’s sight was beginning to fail, she herself would read to him a page or two from St. Clair of the Isles.",CO117CL10
3887,54,"Since there was sometimes a lack of partners, she learned to play cards and, realizing that her uncle liked to win, she always made a point of losing. She went still further: when she was losing badly, she would pretend to be angry or sad, with the sole aim of increasing her uncle’s pleasure. He would roar with laughter, make fun of her, say her nose was too big, and ask for a handkerchief to wipe away her tears, but he carried on adding up his counters every ten minutes, and if one fell on the floor (they used corn kernels), he would rummage around with the candle to find it.",CO117CL10
3888,55,"Three months later, Falcão fell ill. It wasn’t a serious or prolonged illness, but a fear of death nevertheless gripped his soul and it became clear then how very fond he was of his niece. Every visitor to the house was received coldly, or at least with indifference.",CO117CL10
3889,56,"Those closest to him suffered the most, for he would tell them brutally that he was not yet a corpse, that the flesh was still living, that the vultures had picked up the wrong scent, and so on.

3891,58,"Falcão would smile and sip the syrupy concoction. She sat beside the bed, telling him stories; she kept an eye on the clock for when it was time for his soup or chicken broth; she read to him from the everlasting and eternal St. Clair. Then came convalescence. Falcão went out for a few gentle strolls, accompanied by Virgínia. When she offered him her arm, her uncle was delighted to see the care with which she kept her eyes fixed firmly on the cobblestones, for fear of catching a man’s gaze.",CO117CL10
3892,59,"“She’ll be the one at my bedside when I die,” he repeated to himself. One day, he even thought it out loud: “Isn’t it true that you’ll be at my bedside when I die?”",CO117CL10

When they arrived home, Virgínia rushed to her room to reread a letter that a certain Dona Bernarda, an old friend of her mother’s, had given her the day before.

3896,63,"Forty days later, the same Reginaldo disembarked in Rio; he was a young man of thirty and with three hundred thousand dollars to his name. Twenty-four hours later, he visited Falcão, who received him courteously, but nothing more. Reginaldo, though, was shrewd and practical; he struck a chord with the other man, and it resonated.

3906,73,"Reginaldo took a dollar coin out of his vest pocket and showed it to him. Before touching it, Falcão devoured it with his eyes. As it was somewhat dark inside, he stood up and went to the window to get a good look at it—from both sides. He then returned it, warmly praising how well it had been designed and minted, and adding that our old patacas were also rather fine.",CO117CL10
3907,74,"The visits continued. Reginaldo resolved to ask for the young lady’s hand. She, however, told him that he must first earn her uncle’s blessing; she would not marry against his wishes. Undaunted, Reginaldo redoubled his efforts, overwhelming the uncle with tales of fabulous dividends.",CO117CL10
3908,75,"“By the way,” Falcão said to him one day, “you never did show me your coin collection.”",CO117CL10
3909,76,“Come to my house tomorrow.”,CO117CL10
3910,77,"Falcão went, and Reginaldo showed him the collection, displayed in a magnificent glass cabinet. Falcão was flabbergasted; he had expected a little box with one specimen of each coin, and instead found mounds of gold, silver, bronze, and copper. At first Falcão gazed at them in universal and collective wonder; then he began to study them one by one. He only knew the pounds, dollars, and francs, but Reginaldo named all of them: florins, crowns, rubles, drachmas, piastres, pesos, rupees—the entire numismatics of toil, he concluded poetically.",CO117CL10
3911,78,“But what patience you showed in putting this collection together!” said Falcão.,CO117CL10
3912,79,"“Oh, it wasn’t me,” replied Reginaldo. “The collection belonged to the estate of a man from Philadelphia. I bought it for a trifle—five thousand dollars.”",CO117CL10
3913,80,"In reality, of course, it was worth a great deal more. Falcão left Reginaldo’s house with the collection embedded in his soul. He told his niece about it and, in his imagination, he untidied and re-tidied the coins, the way a lover tousles his sweetheart’s hair just in order to smooth it down again. At night, he dreamt he was a florin, tossed by a lansquenet player onto the card table, and that he returned to the player’s pocket with more than two hundred other florins. In the morning, as consolation, he went to examine the coins that he kept in his own safe, but nothing would console him. The finest possessions are those we don’t possess.",CO117CL10
3914,81,"A few days later, at home, in the parlor, he thought he saw some money lying on the floor. He bent down to pick it up; it wasn’t money, just a letter. He opened it absentmindedly and read it in horror: it was from Reginaldo to Virgínia . . . But the reader interrupts me, crying:",CO117CL10

3918,2,"How is it that I found myself up there? It was a sloping, old, very cramped bit of roof with four feet of wall on the back side. I don’t know if I went up there to get something; apparently, I did, but whatever it may have been, it had fallen or flown off, since I no longer had it. I was the one stuck up there, all by myself, with no way of getting back down.",CO180CL08
3919,3,"I had begun to realize it was a nightmare. It was several years ago now. The street or way the building was on was deserted. From above, I was looking in all directions for a trace of a person. Nothing, neither bar nor rope, to save me. In distress, slowly, cautiously, I crept from one side to the next, because the tiles were old and because the slightest carelessness would cause me to slip and go tumbling to the ground. I kept looking into the distance to see if a rescuer was turning up; I looked down, too, but jumping was unthinkable; the height was great, and death certain.",CO180CL08
3920,4,"All at once, I saw a few people below, not many, some walking from the right, others from the left, coming from heaven knows where.",CO180CL08

3922,6,"But the person didn’t hear anything and went his way. I shouted at one person after another; all kept going without hearing my voice. I, standing up, hugging the wall, shouted louder, like a roll of thunder. I was getting more and more frightened, starting to get dizzy; and I shouted for help, for someone to save my life with a ladder, a rope, a bar—I asked for a sheet at least to cushion my fall. All was in vain. Of the people who were going by only three were left, then two, then one. I shouted at the last passerby with all the strength I had left:",CO180CL08
3923,7,“Help! Help!”,CO180CL08
3924,8,"It was a boy, wearing new clothes, and who was walking and looking at his boots and pants. He didn’t hear, went on walking, and disappeared.",CO180CL08
3925,9,"I was alone, but I went on shouting even so. A person I didn’t see, but the danger I did. My distress was unbearable; I was in the throes of terror. . . . I looked down, I looked into the distance, I shouted for help, and my head was spinning and my hair standing on end. . . . I don’t know if I ended up falling; all at once, I found myself awake in bed.",CO180CL08
3926,10,"I took a deep breath, with the feeling of a person who is emerging from a nightmare. But an unusual phenomenon occurred here; once out of danger, I started savoring it. In fact, I had had a few minutes or seconds of extraordinary sensations; I experienced sheer terror, vertigo, and despair, between life and death, like a shuttlecock in the hands of these two mysteries. For all that, the certainty that it had been a dream now lent the danger another aspect, and it gave me the vague desire to find myself in it again. Why not, if it was a dream?",CO180CL08
3927,11,"I was thinking that way, with my eyes closed, half asleep; I hadn’t forgotten the circumstances of the nightmare, and the certainty that I wouldn’t end up falling now clearly ignited my desire to find myself atop the wall again, forsaken and terrified. I squeezed my eyes shut tight, then, to keep from waking completely up and to keep my imagination from having time to move on to another class of visions.",CO180CL08
3928,12,"I fell asleep. Dreams came in fragments—a voice here, a profile there, groups of people, of houses, a hill, vapor, sunshine, thirty thousand muddled things that were stitched together and came unstitched. All at once I saw a roof—I remembered the earlier one—and since I had fallen asleep in hopes of resuming the nightmare, I had mixed feelings of delight and terror. It was the roof of a house; the house had a window; in the window was a man; this man greeted me with a smile, opened the door, had me come again, closed the door again, and pocketed the key.",CO180CL08
3929,13,“What’s this?” I asked him.,CO180CL08
3930,14,"“It’s so no one will bother us,” he replied smiling.",CO180CL08
3931,15,"He then told me that he was working on a book, was involved in a lawsuit, and was running for congress: three unending subjects. He talked to me about the book—three hundred pages with citations, notes, appendices; he went over the tenets, the method, the style; he read me three chapters. I praised them highly; he read me four more. Then, rolling up the manuscript, he told me he foresaw the critiques and objections; he told me what they were and refuted them one after the other.",CO180CL08
3932,16,"I, seated, kept my ears pricked to see if anyone was turning up; I begged God for a robber or a representative of the law and order to break down the door. If he spoke of the law, it was to tell me about his lawsuit, which was extortion on the part of his adversary, but he was going to triumph over him no matter what. He didn’t keep anything from me; I heard the justification and all of the particulars of the case, not to mention intervening anecdotes, one about a clerk bought off by his adversary, another about a prosecutor, conversations with judges, three judicial decisions and their corresponding fundaments.",CO180CL08
3933,17,"With all of his litigating, the man was familiar with a lot of legal texts, decrees, laws, ordinances—he cited books and articles, sprinkled Latin gibberish everywhere. At times, he spoke while pacing to describe the plot of land—it was business about land—the river here, I go down there, running into the other fellow farther down; on this side so-and-so’s land, on the other side the other side another fellow’s. . . . An obvious theft. What did I think?",CO180CL08
3934,18,“Of course.”,CO180CL08
3935,19,"He rubbed his head and moved on to his candidacy. It was legitimate; he didn’t deny that there could be other acceptable candidacies, but his was more legitimate. He had served the party, he wasn’t just anything there, he wasn’t begging for votes. And he was counting on the services he had provided over twenty years of electoral struggles, of struggles in the press, support for friends, obedience to party bosses.",CO180CL08
3936,20,"And was there no reward for this? Was he supposed to cede his place to children? He read the circular—it was barely three pages long, seven with the verbal commentary. And it was a man of this sort whose advance they were trying to stop? They could plot against him; he knew there was plotting—there was a flood of anonymous letters. . . .",CO180CL08
3937,21,"Let the flood continue! They could comb through his past, but they would find nothing, nothing but a pure life and, modesty aside, a model of excellent attributes. He had started out poor, very poor; if he had anything it was the result of work and thrift, the two levers of progress.",CO180CL08
3938,22,"If just one of those old levers had been there it would have been enough to bring the door down, but there was neither; it was just the man, who kept going, telling me everything he was or wasn’t and what he had been or what he would become—a Hercules who would clean the Augean stables, a strong man who was asking only for time and justice. Do him justice by giving him votes, and he would take care of the rest. And the rest was a lot more than what I had thought. . . . I, defeated, looked at the door, and the door, silent, impenetrable, gave me not the slightest hope. Lasciate ogni speranza. . . .",CO180CL08
3939,23,"No, it’s more than hope here; reality found me awake in bed again. It was still late at night, yet I didn’t try, as I had earlier, to go back to sleep. I read to keep from dropping off. Why? A man, a book, a lawsuit, a candidacy—why is it that I feared encountering them anew if before I had cheerfully gone back up to the roof where. . . ?",CO180CL08
3940,24,"The reason is simple. I think that when life is threatened it has an unusual and appealing flavor, but that when patience is threatened there is nothing.

3943,3,I,CO143CL07
3944,4,"The stars, when they saw lots of fireflies the color of milk rising in the night sky, would often say that they were the sighs of the king of Siam, who was enjoying himself with his three hundred concubines. And, winking at one another, they would ask:",CO143CL07

3948,8,"One night, there were so many fireflies that the stars, full of fear, ran and hid, and they took over part of outer space, where they stayed forever under the name of “The Milky Way.”",CO143CL07
3949,9,This enormous ascent of thoughts was caused by the fact that the four academies of Siam wanted to resolve this singular problem: why is it that there are feminine men and masculine women? And it was the young king’s nature that induced them to do this. Kalaphangko was virtually a lady.,CO143CL07
3950,10,"Everything in him breathed the most exquisite femininity: he had sweet eyes; a voice like silver; an obedient, passive manner; and a heart-felt fear of battle. The Siamese warriors grumbled, but the nation was always happy. The only things that mattered were dances, plays, and songs. It was the same for the king himself, who did not care about anything else. Hence the stars’ illusion.",CO143CL07
3951,11,"That is, until one of the academies found this solution to the problem:",CO143CL07

3954,14,"Nothing more was necessary for the alleys and rivers of Bangkok to be stained with academic blood. First came controversy, then discomposure, and lastly the beating. At the beginning of the discomposure, everything was not so bad. None of the rivals hurled an insult that was not scrupulously derived from Sanskrit. This was their academic language, the Latin of Siam. But from then on they lost all sense of shame. The rivalry got out of hand, put its hand to the hilt, and descended into flames, to stone throwing, to blows, to vile gestures, until the sexual academy, exasperated, decided to finish off the others. It organized a sinister plan . . .",CO143CL07
3955,15,"Oh gusting winds, if you would, take these leaves of paper so that I might not recount the tragedy of Siam! I can hardly—oh my!—I can hardly write of this singular retaliation. The academics armed themselves in secret and sought out the others right when the latter, bent over the famous problem, were making a cloud of fireflies rise to the heavens. No preamble, no pity. They fell upon them, frothing with rage.",CO143CL07
3956,16,"Those who succeeded in escaping could not run for long. Pursued and attacked, they died on the banks of the river, aboard the ferries, or in dark allies. There were thirty-eight bodies total. They cut the ears off their opponents’ masters and made necklaces and bracelets for their own triumphant teacher, the sublime U-Tong. Drunk with victory, they celebrated the deed with great festivities, in which they sang this magnificent anthem: “Glory be to us, we who are the rice of science and the light of the universe.”",CO143CL07
3957,17,"The city awoke in a stupor. Terror took control of the masses. No one could absolve such a cruel, ugly act. Some even began to doubt what they were seeing . . . Only one person approved of it all. It was the beautiful Kinnara, the flower of the royal concubines.",CO143CL07

She was a buffalo that made her way to the back room just then, but a few minutes later it was the swan that stopped and, bending its neck, asked and received from the king, amidst her caresses, a decree in which the doctrine of the sexual soul was declared to be legitimate and orthodox, and the other one absurd and perverse.",CO143CL07
3969,29,"On that same day, the decree was sent to the triumphant academy, to the pagodas, the mandarins, to the entire kingdom. The academy set up lamps. Public order was restored.",CO143CL07

3974,34,“What would that be?”,CO143CL07

3976,36,"Kalaphangko laughed heartily at the idea and asked her how they would make the trade. She responded that they would use the method of Mukunda, king of the Hindus, who placed himself in the body of a Brahman, while a truant inhabited Mukunda. It was an old legend passed on to the Turks, the Persians, and the Christians. Yes, but the formula for such an invocation? Kinnara made known that she had it in her possession. An old Buddhist monk had found a copy of it in the ruins of a temple.",CO143CL07
3977,37,“Would that work?”,CO143CL07
3978,38,"“I cannot believe my own decree,” he responded, laughing, “but go ahead. If it is true, let us trade . . . but for a semester, no more. At the end of the semester we will return our souls to these bodies.”",CO143CL07
3979,39,"They agreed that it would take place that very night. While the entire city was asleep, they summoned the royal pirogue, embarked, and set themselves adrift. None of the rowers could see them. When the dawn first appeared, lashing the sparkling cows, Kinnara proffered the mysterious incantation. Her soul came loose, and it hung in the air, waiting for the king’s body to become available. Her body fell to the carpet.",CO143CL07
3980,40,“Ready?” asked Kalaphangko.,CO143CL07
3981,41,"“Ready! Here I am in the air, just waiting. Your Majesty will pardon my indignity . . .”",CO143CL07
3982,42,"But the king’s soul did not hear the rest. Sprightly and sparkling, he left his physical vessel and penetrated Kinnara’s body while she entered the royal remains. Both bodies looked one another in the eye. One can imagine their shock.",CO143CL07
3983,43,"It was the situation of Buoso and the snake, as old Dante tells it—but just look at my audacity!",CO143CL07

3985,45,"“Really,” asked Kalaphangko, “looking at myself and treating him with majesty is a very strange thing. Does Your Majesty not feel the same?”",CO143CL07
3986,46,"They were both fine, like people who had finally found a suitable home. Kalaphangko stretched out in Kinnara’s feminine curves. She felt complete in the rigid torso of Kalaphangko.",CO143CL07
3987,47,Siam finally had a king.,CO143CL07
3988,48,IV,CO143CL07
3989,49,"The first act of Kalaphangko (henceforth it must be understood that it is the king’s body and Kinnara’s soul, and the body of Kinnara the beautiful Siamese concubine has the soul of Kalaphangko) was to give nothing less than the highest honors to the sexual academy. He did not elevate its members to mandarins, since they were thinking men given to philosophy and literature more than men of action and administration, but he declared that all should fall prostrate before them, as was customary regarding mandarins.",CO143CL07
3990,50,"Additionally, he gave them great gifts, rare or valuable things, straw-stuffed crocodiles, ivory chairs, emerald tableware, diamonds, relics. The academy, grateful for so many gifts, further requested the right to officially use the title of “Light of the World,” which was granted to it.",CO143CL07
3991,51,"When this was done, Kalaphangko took care of the public treasury, the courts, worship, and ceremony. The nation began to feel the heavy weight, if I may speak like the great Camões, since no less than eleven tax evaders were decapitated on the spot. Naturally, the others, preferring their heads over their money, scrambled to pay the taxes, and everything went back to normal.",CO143CL07
3992,52,"The courts and legislature saw great improvements. New pagodas were built, and religion seemed to gain a new impetus, since Kalaphangko, imitating the ancient Spanish arts, had a dozen pitiful Christian missionaries, who had been around those parts, burned alive. The Buddhist monks of the land called this the pearl of his reign.",CO143CL07
3993,53,"The only thing left to do was to go to war. Kalaphangko, under a more or less diplomatic pretext, attacked another kingdom, and he launched the shortest, most glorious campaign of the century. Returning to Bangkok, he was greeted with splendid celebrations. Three hundred ships lined with scarlet and blue silk sailed out to greet him. Each of these had a golden swan or dragon on its bow and was crewed by the city’s finest. Music and shouts filled the air. At night, when the festivities had ended, the beautiful concubine whispered in his ear:",CO143CL07
3994,54,"“My young warrior, repay me for my longing loneliness while you were away. Tell me that your tender Kinnara is the finest fête.”",CO143CL07
3995,55,Kalaphangko responded with a kiss.,CO143CL07
3996,56,"“Your lips have the cold of death or disdain,” she sighed.",CO143CL07
3997,57,"It was true. The king was distracted and preoccupied; he was meditating on a tragedy. The end of the term was fast approaching, and they would soon return to their own bodies. The king was considering a way out of the clauses of the pact: he would kill the beautiful Siamese concubine. The king hesitated because he did not know if he would suffer when the concubine died, since the body was his own, or even if he would succumb to death as well. This was Kalaphangko’s doubt, but the idea of death cast a shadow over his face as he caressed a tiny vial of poison, copied from the Borgias, on his chest.",CO143CL07
3998,58,"All of a sudden, the king thought of the enlightened academy. He could consult it, not outright, but by hypothesis. He had the academics brought to him. All of them came except their teacher, the illustrious U-Tong, who was sick. There were thirteen. They fell prostrate and said to him in the Siamese way:",CO143CL07
3999,59,"“We, despicable strands of straw, come running to Kalaphangko’s call.”",CO143CL07
4000,60,"“Arise,” said the king, benevolently.",CO143CL07
4001,61,"“The place of dirt is the ground,” they insisted, knees and elbows in the earth.",CO143CL07
4002,62,"“Then I will be the wind that lifts the dirt,” Kalaphangko replied. And with a gesture full of grace and tolerance, he extended his hands to them.",CO143CL07
4003,63,"Immediately, he began to speak of disparate things, so that his main concern would come about on its own. He spoke of the latest news from the Occident and the laws of Manusmriti. Referring to U-Tong, he asked them if he really was a great sage, which he seemed to be. But he saw them muddling their answer, so he ordered them to tell the whole truth. With exemplary unanimity, they confessed that U-Tong was one of the most singular idiots of the kingdom; he was a shallow, cowardly spirit who knew nothing and was incapable of learning anything. Kalaphangko was shocked. An idiot?",CO143CL07
4004,64,"“We are sorry to say it, but that’s exactly what he is. He is a shallow, disturbed soul. He has an excellent heart, pure character, elevated . . .”",CO143CL07
4005,65,"Kalaphangko, when he awoke from his shock, sent the academics away without asking them what he had wanted to. An idiot? He had to unseat the master without disturbing him. Three days later U-Tong came to the summons of the king. The latter tenderly inquired about his health, then he said that he wanted to send someone to Japan to study some documents, an affair that could only be trusted to a very enlightened person.",CO143CL07
4006,66,Which of his colleagues at the academy seemed most fitting for such a need? Let us clarify the king’s plan: he was to hear two or three names and conclude that he preferred U-Tong over all of them. But just listen to what the master told him:,CO143CL07
4007,67,"“Royal Lord, pardon my crude words. These men are thirteen camels, with the exception that camels are humble, and they are not. They compare themselves to the sun and the moon. But, in truth, neither the moon nor the sun has done so many singularly shameful things as those thirteen men. . . . I understand Your Majesty’s amazement, but I would be worth nothing if I did not tell you this in all loyalty, although confidentially . . .”",CO143CL07
4008,68,"Kalaphangko’s jaw dropped. Thirteen camels? Thirteen, thirteen. U-Tong only redeemed all of their souls, which he declared to be excellent; nothing better than these men in terms of character. Kalaphangko, with an elegant gesture of complacency, dismissed the sublime U-Tong and remained pensive. No one ever learned what his reflections were. It is known that he called the other academics. But this time he called each one separately so that his intentions would not be blatant and so that he would have the greatest extent.",CO143CL07
4009,69,"The first who came, ignorant of U-Tong’s opinion, confirmed it entirely, with the exception that there were twelve camels, or thirteen, if one counted U-Tong himself. The second did not have a different opinion, nor did the third, nor did the rest of the academics. They only differed in style: some said camels, others used circumlocutions and metaphors that always ended up saying the same thing. However, there were no insults to the individuals’ moral character. Kalaphangko was speechless.",CO143CL07
4010,70,"But that was not the king’s last shock. Unable to consult the academy, he tried to deliberate for himself, which he spent two days doing, until the beautiful Kinnara told him in secret that she was a mother. This news made him give up on the crime. How could he destroy the chosen vase of the flower that would come next spring? He swore to heaven and earth that the child would live and grow. The end of the semester arrived. It was time to return the souls to their original bodies.",CO143CL07
4011,71,"Like the first time, they got into the royal boat at night and let themselves go downstream, both not really wanting to, already missing the bodies they would leave behind for one another. When the sparkling cows of the earliest morning began to wander the heavens, the couple offered them the mysterious formula and each soul was returned to its former body. Kinnara, returning to hers, had a maternal commotion, just as she had a paternal one when she occupied Kalaphangko’s body. It even seemed to her that she was mother and father of the child at the same time.",CO143CL07

4014,74,"And the music got ever closer, now more distinct, until, at a curve of the river, there appeared to the eyes of them both a magnificent ship adorned with plumes and pennants.

4015,75,"The eyes of the beautiful Kinnara (the former Kalaphangko) bulged in surprise. She could not understand how fourteen men gathered in an academy were the light of the world, yet separately they were a multitude of camels. Kalaphangko, whom she consulted, found no explanation. If somebody finds one, he or she can provide it to one of the most elegant ladies of the Orient by sending it in a sealed letter and, for additional security, copying it to our consul in Shanghai, China.",CO143CL07

4051,36,"Kalaphangko scoffed at the idea, and asked her just how they would achieve such an exchange. She replied that she would use the method of Mukunda, the king of the Hindus, who placed himself in the corpse of a Brahmin while a jester entered Mukunda’s. It’s an old legend passed down to the Turks, Persians, and Christians. Yes, but how was the invocation worded? Kinnara declared that she knew the wording, because an old Buddhist monk had found a copy of it in the ruins of a temple.",CO143CL12

4053,38,"“I don’t actually believe in my own decree,” he retorted, laughing, “but go ahead; if it’s true, let’s switch. But only for six months, no more. At the end of six months, we’ll change back.”",CO143CL12
4054,39,"They agreed to make the exchange that very night. While the city slept, they sent for the royal barge, stepped aboard, and let themselves drift away. None of the rowers saw them. When Dawn appeared, urging on the golden-red cows drawing her glittering chariot, Kinnara offered up the mysterious invocation. Her soul detached itself from her body and hovered in the air, waiting for the king’s body to become vacant too. Her own body lay slumped on the rug.",CO143CL12

4057,42,"But the king’s soul did not hear the rest. Sprightly and shimmering, it left its physical vessel and entered Kinnara’s body, while her soul took possession of the royal remains. Both bodies sat up and gazed at each other, and one can only imagine their amazement.",CO143CL12

4060,45,Kalaphangko said: “This business of looking at myself and calling myself ‘Your Majesty’ is very strange. Does Your Majesty not feel the same?”,CO143CL12
4061,46,"Both of them were content, like people who have finally found their proper home. Kalaphangko luxuriated in Kinnara’s feminine curves. Kinnara flexed her muscles in Kalaphangko’s solid torso.",CO143CL12
4062,47,Siam finally had a king.,CO143CL12
4063,48,IV,CO143CL12
4064,49,"Kalaphangko’s first action (from now on, it should be understood that “Kalaphangko” means the king’s body and Kinnara’s soul, whereas “Kinnara” means the body of the beautiful Siamese lady and Kalaphangko’s soul) was to bestow the very highest honors upon the sexual academy. He did not elevate its members to the status of mandarins, for they were men given to philosophy and literature rather than action and administration, but he decreed that everyone must prostrate themselves before them, as was the custom with mandarins.",CO143CL12
4065,50,"He also presented them with rare and valuable gifts, such as stuffed crocodiles, ivory chairs, emerald tableware, diamonds, and sacred relics. Grateful for all these favors, the academy also requested the official right to use the title “Light of the World,” which was duly granted.",CO143CL12
4066,51,"Once this was done, Kalaphangko turned his attention to the public finances, justice, religion, and ceremonial matters. The nation began to feel the “heavy weight,” to use the words of our distinguished poet, Camões—for no less than eleven tax dodgers were forthwith beheaded. The others, who naturally preferred their heads to their money, rushed to pay their taxes, and order was quickly restored.",CO143CL12
4067,52,"The courts and legislation were greatly improved. New pagodas were built, and religion seemed to gain a new impetus, since Kalaphangko, imitating the ancient Spanish arts, ordered the burning of a dozen poor Christian missionaries who were wandering those parts; the bonzes called this action the “pearl” of his reign.",CO143CL12
4068,53,"What he lacked was a war. On a more or less diplomatic pretext, Kalaphangko attacked a neighboring kingdom, in what was the shortest and most glorious campaign of the century. On his return to Bangkok, he was greeted with splendid celebrations. Three hundred boats decorated with blue and scarlet silk went out to receive him. On the prow of each boat stood a golden dragon or swan, and all the boats were crewed by the city’s finest inhabitants. Music and cheering filled the air. At night, when the festivities had ended, his beautiful concubine whispered in his ear:",CO143CL12
4069,54,"“My young warrior, repay me for the pangs of longing that I felt in your absence; tell me that the greatest of celebrations is your sweet Kinnara.”",CO143CL12
4070,55,Kalaphangko responded with a kiss.,CO143CL12
4071,56,"“Your lips have the chill of death or disdain on them,” she sighed.",CO143CL12
4072,57,"It was true; the king was distracted and preoccupied, for he was plotting a tragedy. It was getting close to the time when they should return to their own bodies, and he was thinking of escaping that clause in their agreement by killing his beautiful concubine. He hesitated because he did not know if he, too, would suffer upon her death, given that it was his body, or even if he would have to succumb with her. Such were Kalaphangko’s thoughts. But the idea of death cast a shadow over his brow, while, imitating the Borgias, he clutched to his breast a little vial of poison.",CO143CL12
4073,58,"Suddenly he remembered the learned academy; he could consult it, not directly, but hypothetically. He summoned the academicians; they all came except their president, the illustrious U-Tong, who was ill. There were thirteen of them; they prostrated themselves and, in the Siamese manner, said:",CO143CL12
4074,59,"“Mere despicable straws that we are, we hasten to answer the call of Kalaphangko.”",CO143CL12
4075,60,"“Arise,” said the king benevolently.",CO143CL12
4076,61,"“No, the place for dust is underfoot,” they insisted, their knees and elbows on the ground.",CO143CL12
4077,62,"“Then I will be the wind that lifts up the dust,” replied Kalaphangko, and, with a gracious, tolerant gesture, he stretched out his hands to them.",CO143CL12
4078,63,"He then started to talk about a variety of matters, so that the main topic of interest should appear to arise naturally of its own accord. He spoke of the latest news from the west and the Laws of Manu. Referring to U-Tong, he asked them whether he really was as great a sage as he seemed; when he received only a reluctant, mumbled response, he ordered them to tell him the whole truth. They confessed, with exemplary unanimity, that U-Tong was one of the most sublime idiots in the kingdom—a shallow, worthless mind who knew nothing and was incapable of learning. Kalaphangko was shocked. An idiot?",CO143CL12
4079,64,"“It pains us to say so, but that is what he is; a shallow, withered intellect. He has, however, a pure heart, and a noble, elevated character.”",CO143CL12
4080,65,"When he had recovered from his shock, Kalaphangko told the academicians to leave, without asking them the question he had intended to ask. An idiot? He would somehow have to unseat him from the academy without offending him. Three days later, U-Tong was summoned by the king. The king inquired kindly after his health. He then said that he wanted to send someone to Japan to study some documents; it was a matter which could only be entrusted to a person of enlightenment.",CO143CL12
4081,66,"Which of his colleagues at the academy seemed to him most suitable for such a task? One can see the king’s cunning plan: he would hear two or three names, and then conclude that he preferred U-Tong himself to all of them. But here’s what U-Tong replied:",CO143CL12
4082,67,"“My royal lord and master, if you will pardon my coarse language: the men you speak of are thirteen camels, except that camels are modest and they are not. They compare themselves to the sun and the moon. But, in truth, neither the sun nor the moon has ever shone on such worthless fools. I understand Your Majesty’s surprise, but I would be unworthy of my position if I did not say this with all due loyalty, albeit confidentially . . .”",CO143CL12
4083,68,"Kalaphangko’s jaw dropped. Thirteen camels? Thirteen, thirteen! U-Tong’s only kind word was for their hearts, all of which he declared to be excellent; no one was superior to them in terms of character. With an elegant, indulgent gesture, Kalaphangko dismissed the sublime U-Tong from his presence, and remained pensive. What his thoughts were, no one knew. What we do know is that he sent for the other academicians, but this time separately, to conceal his intentions and obtain a franker exchange of views.",CO143CL12
4084,69,"The first to arrive, although unaware of U-Tong’s opinion, was entirely in agreement, with but one emendation, that there were twelve camels, or thirteen if one counted U-Tang himself. The second academician expressed the same opinion, as did the third and all the others. They differed only in style: some said camels, others used circumlocutions and metaphors that meant the same thing. However, none of them cast any aspersions on anyone’s moral character. Kalaphangko was speechless.",CO143CL12
4085,70,"But this was not the final shock to greet the king. Since he could not consult the academy, he attempted to make his own deliberations. He devoted two whole days to this, but then the beautiful Kinnara revealed that she was going to be a mother. This news made him recoil from the crime he had been planning. How could he destroy the chosen vessel of the flower that would bloom the following spring? He swore to heaven and earth that the child would be born and would flourish. The end of the week arrived, and with it the moment for each of them to return to their original bodies.",CO143CL12
4086,71,"As on the previous occasion, they boarded the royal barge at night, and let themselves drift downstream, both of them against their will, not wanting to give up the body they had and return to the other. When the shimmering cows of Dawn’s chariot began to tread slowly across the sky, they offered up the mysterious invocation, and each soul was returned to its former body. On returning to hers, Kinnara felt a maternal instinct, just as she had felt a paternal instinct when she occupied Kalaphongko’s body. It even seemed to her that she was simultaneously mother and father of the child.",CO143CL12
4087,72,"“Father and mother?” repeated the king, restored to his former self.",CO143CL12
4088,73,"They were interrupted by delightful music in the distance. It was a junk or a canoe coming upriver, for the music was fast approaching. By then the sun was flooding the waters and green riverbanks with light, giving the scene an air of life and rebirth, which to some extent made the two lovers forget this return to their former selves.",CO143CL12
4089,74,"And the music kept coming closer, clearer now, until a magnificent boat appeared around a bend in the river, decorated with feathers and fluttering pennants. Aboard were the fourteen members of the academy (including U-Tong), all chanting in unison that old hymn: “Glory be to us, for we are the rice of science and the light of the world!”",CO143CL12
4090,75,"The beautiful Kinnara (formerly Kalaphangko) was wide-eyed with astonishment. She could not understand how fourteen males, gathered together in an academy, could be both the light of the world, and yet, individually, a bunch of camels. She consulted Kalaphangko, but he could think of no explanation. If someone happens to find one, they would be doing a great service to one of the most gracious ladies in the Orient by sending it to her in a sealed letter, addressed, for greater security, to our consul in Shanghai, China.",CO143CL12

4168,3,I,CO143CL10
4169,4,"Whenever they saw swarms of milky-hued fireflies rising up through the night sky, the stars would often say that these were the sighs of the king of Siam, who was amusing himself with his three hundred concubines. And, winking at each other, they would ask:",CO143CL10
4170,5,"“Pray tell us, O regal sighs, what is the beautiful Kalaphangko up to tonight?”",CO143CL10
4171,6,To which the fireflies would reply gravely:,CO143CL10
4172,7,“We are the sublime thoughts of the four academies of Siam; we bring with us all the wisdom of the universe.”,CO143CL10
4173,8,"One night, there were so many fireflies that the stars took fright and hid in their bedrooms, and the fireflies took over part of outer space, where they stayed forever and called themselves the “Milky Way.”",CO143CL10
4174,9,This enormous rising cloud of thoughts was the result of the four academies of Siam trying to solve a very peculiar puzzle: Why are there feminine men and masculine women? And it was the nature of their young king that led them to ask this question. Kalaphangko was virtually a lady.,CO143CL10
4175,10,"Everything about him breathed the most exquisite femininity: he had velvety eyes, a silvery voice, gentle, amenable manners, and an abiding horror of war. The Siamese warlords grumbled, but the nation lived very happily; everywhere there were dances, plays, and songs, following the example of the king, who cared for little else, which rather explains the stars’ misinterpretation of those sighs.",CO143CL10

It wasn’t so bad when the insults began; no one hurled abuse that was not scrupulously derived from Sanskrit, which was the academic language, the Latin of Siam. From then on, though, they lost all shame. The rivalry turned very nasty indeed, rolled up its sleeves, and descended into mudslinging, stone-throwing, punches, and vile gestures, until, in exasperation, the sexual academy (i.e., that which espoused the sexuality of souls) decided to put an end to the other three academies, and prepared a sinister plan . . .",CO143CL10
4180,15,"O winds that blow, scatter forth these leaves of paper, that I may not recount the tragedy of Siam! For—woe is me!—I can scarcely bear to write of such a dastardly revenge. They secretly armed themselves and went to find the members of the other academies, just as the latter, sitting hunched in thought over the famous puzzle, were dispatching a cloud of fireflies up to heaven. They gave no warning and showed no pity, but fell upon them, foaming with rage.",CO143CL10
4181,16,"Those who fled did not flee for long; pursued and attacked, they died on the riverbank, aboard barges, or in dark alleyways. Altogether there were thirty-eight corpses. An ear was cut off from each of the leaders, and these were made into necklaces and bracelets for their own victorious president, the sublime U-Tong. Drunk on victory, they celebrated the deed with a great feast, at which they sang this magnificent hymn: “Glory be to us, for we are the rice of science and the lamp of the universe.”",CO143CL10
4182,17,"The city awoke to this horrifying news. Terror gripped the masses. No one could forgive such a cruel and despicable act; some even doubted their own eyes. Only one person approved of it all: the beautiful Kinnara, the flower of the royal concubines.",CO143CL10

4193,28,"Kinnara leapt angrily to her feet. Just as the king was the feminine man, she was the masculine woman—a buffalo in swan’s feathers. Just now it was the buffalo that strode across the bedchamber, but, a moment later, it was the swan that stopped and, tilting her neck, asked and obtained from the king, between two gentle caresses, a decree in which the doctrine of the sexual soul was declared legitimate and orthodox, and the other doctrine absurd and perverse.",CO143CL10
4194,29,"On that same day, the decree was sent to the victorious academy, to all the pagodas and mandarins, and distributed throughout the kingdom. The academy hung out lanterns, and peace was restored.",CO143CL10

4201,36,"Kalaphangko scoffed at the idea, and asked her just how they would achieve such an exchange. She replied that she would use the method of Mukunda, the king of the Hindus, who placed himself in the corpse of a Brahmin while a jester entered Mukunda’s. It’s an old legend passed down to the Turks, Persians, and Christians. Yes, but how was the invocation worded?

4237,72,"“Father and mother?” repeated the king, restored to his former self.",CO143CL10
4238,73,"They were interrupted by delightful music in the distance. It was a junk or a canoe coming upriver, for the music was fast approaching. By then the sun was flooding the waters and green riverbanks with light, giving the scene an air of life and rebirth, which to some extent made the two lovers forget this return to their former selves.",CO143CL10
4239,74,"And the music kept coming closer, clearer now, until a magnificent boat appeared around a bend in the river, decorated with feathers and fluttering pennants. Aboard were the fourteen members of the academy (including U-Tong), all chanting in unison that old hymn: “Glory be to us, for we are the rice of science and the light of the world!”",CO143CL10
4240,75,"The beautiful Kinnara (formerly Kalaphangko) was wide-eyed with astonishment. She could not understand how fourteen males, gathered together in an academy, could be both the light of the world, and yet, individually, a bunch of camels. She consulted Kalaphangko, but he could think of no explanation. If someone happens to find one, they would be doing a great service to one of the most gracious ladies in the Orient by sending it to her in a sealed letter, addressed, for greater security, to our consul in Shanghai, China.",CO143CL10

4242,2,"ON APRIL 25, a Saturday morning, José Lemos’s house was in total uproar. The dinner service that was only used on special occasions was being brought out, stairs and hallways were being scrubbed, and suckling pigs and turkeys were being stuffed ready to be roasted in the baker’s oven across the road; there was no rest for anyone; something of great importance was about to happen.",CO047CL12
4243,3,"José Lemos was in charge of sorting out the parlor. Perched on a bench, the worthy master of the house was attempting to hang the two engravings he had bought the day before from Bernasconi’s; one depicted The Death of Sardanapalus, the other The Execution of Mary Stuart. He and his wife were having a bit of a battle about where to hang the first engraving.",CO047CL12
4244,4,"Dona Beatriz thought it indecent, all those men embracing a lot of naked women. Besides, such gloomy subjects were hardly suitable for a celebration. José Lemos had been a member of a literary society in his youth, and replied loftily that these were historical paintings, and that history had a place in every family. He might have added that not every family had a place in history, but that little joke was in even poorer taste than the engravings.",CO047CL12
4245,5,"Keys in hand, but not quite as disheveled as the lady in Tolentino’s famous satirical sonnet, Dona Beatriz was bustling back and forth between parlor and kitchen, issuing orders, chivying the slaves, gathering up clean tablecloths and napkins, and dictating shopping lists; in short, dealing with the thousand and one things that every mistress of the house has to deal with, especially on such an important day.",CO047CL12
4246,6,"Now and then, Dona Beatriz would go to the foot of the stairs and shout:",CO047CL12
4247,7,"“Girls, come down and have your breakfast!”",CO047CL12
4248,8,"It seems, though, that the girls were in no hurry, because they only obeyed their mother’s summons when it was past nine o’clock, and she had already called up to them eight times and was even about to climb the stairs to their bedroom—quite a sacrifice for such a plump lady.",CO047CL12
4249,9,"The Lemos girls were two dark-haired beauties. One was about twenty, the other seventeen; both were tall and slightly overdressed. The older girl looked somewhat pale, while the other, pink-cheeked and cheerful, came down the stairs singing a popular ballad of the time. Of the two, it would seem that she was the happier one, but this was not the case; the happier sister was the older girl, who, that very day, was to tie the knot with young Luís Duarte, after a long and persistent courtship.",CO047CL12
4250,10,"She was pale because she had barely slept, even though she had never before suffered from insomnia, but then some illnesses do just come and go.",CO047CL12
4251,11,"The two girls came downstairs, received their mother’s blessing as well as a brief telling-off, then went into the parlor to talk to their father. José Lemos, who had just changed the position of the pictures for the seventh time, asked his daughters whether the engraving of Mary Stuart would be better on this side of the sofa or on the other. The girls said it would be best left where it was, and this verdict put an end to all José Lemos’s doubts, and, deeming his work to be done, he went off to have his breakfast.",CO047CL12
4252,12,"Also seated at the breakfast table, along with José Lemos, Dona Beatriz, Carlota (the bride), and Luísa, were Rodrigo Lemos and little Antonico, the Lemoses’ two sons. Rodrigo was eighteen and Antonico six; Antonico was a miniature version of Rodrigo, with whom he shared another brotherly trait, that of extreme idleness.",CO047CL12
4253,13,"From eight o’clock in the morning on, Rodrigo was to be found doing one of two things: either reading the advertisements in the newspaper or going into the kitchen to find out when breakfast would be served. As for Antonico, he, as usual, had eaten a large plate of porridge at six o’clock, and then slept peacefully until the nursemaid called him.",CO047CL12
4254,14,"Breakfast passed without incident. José Lemos preferred not to talk while he was eating; Rodrigo recounted the plot of the play he had seen the previous night at the Ginásio; and that was the sole topic of conversation. When breakfast was over, Rodrigo got up to smoke a cigarette, and José Lemos leaned his elbows on the table, peered out at the rather ominous sky over toward Tijuca, and asked if it looked as if rain were likely.",CO047CL12
4255,15,"Antonico was just about to leave the table, having first asked permission, when his mother issued this warning:",CO047CL12
4256,16,"“Now, Antonico, at supper, I don’t want you to do what you always do when there are strangers here.”",CO047CL12
4257,17,“What’s that?” asked José Lemos.,CO047CL12
4258,18,"“He gets all embarrassed and sticks his finger up his nose. Only silly boys do that, and I don’t like it.”",CO047CL12
4259,19,"Deeply humiliated, Antonico ran into the parlor in floods of tears, Dona Beatriz hurried after her youngest child to comfort him, and everyone else left the table.",CO047CL12
4260,20,"José Lemos checked with his wife that no one had been omitted from the guest list, and, having established that everyone who should have been invited was there, he prepared to go out. He was immediately given various errands: to ask the hairdresser to come early, to buy gloves for his wife and his daughters, to make sure the carriages were ready, to order ice cream and wines, and certain other tasks in which he could have been helped by young Rodrigo, had that namesake of El Cid not gone upstairs to sleep off breakfast.",CO047CL12
4261,21,"No sooner had the soles of José Lemos’s shoes touched the cobbled street outside than Dona Beatriz instructed her daughter Carlota to follow her into the parlor, where she immediately addressed her as follows:",CO047CL12
4262,22,"“Today, my dear, your life as a single woman will end, and tomorrow, married life will begin. Having undergone the same transformation myself, I know from personal experience that being married brings with it many heavy responsibilities. Obviously, every woman must learn for herself, but I am following the example of your grandmother, who, on the eve of my marriage to your father, set out in clear and simple language what it means to be married and the great responsibility involved in this new role . . .”",CO047CL12
4263,23,"Dona Beatriz stopped speaking, and Carlota, attributing her mother’s silence to a desire for some response, said nothing, but planted a fond, filial kiss on her mother’s cheek.",CO047CL12
4264,24,"Had Luís Duarte’s bride peered through the keyhole of her father’s study only three days before, she would have realized that Dona Beatriz was reciting a speech composed by José Lemos, and that her silence was merely a temporary memory lapse.",CO047CL12
4265,25,"It would have been far better had Dona Beatriz, like other mothers, offered advice drawn from her own heart and experience. Maternal love is the best rhetoric in the world, but Senhor José Lemos, who, ever since he was a young man, had preserved a certain literary bent, felt that, on such a solemn occasion, it would be wrong to run the risk of his better half making any grammatical errors.",CO047CL12
4266,26,"Dona Beatriz resumed her speech, which was not that long, and concluded by asking if Carlota really did love her fiancé and was not, as did occasionally happen, getting married out of pique. Carlota replied that she loved her fiancé as dearly as she loved her parents, and the mother then kissed her daughter with a tenderness not provided for in José Lemos’s prose.",CO047CL12
4267,27,"At about two o’clock in the afternoon, José Lemos returned, dripping with sweat, but feeling very pleased with himself, because, as well as carrying out all his wife’s errands as regards carriages, hairdressers, etc., he had managed to persuade Lieutenant Porfírio to join them for supper, something which, up until then, had been by no means certain.",CO047CL12
4268,28,"Lieutenant Porfírio was what you might call an after-dinner speaker, possessing, as he did, the necessary confidence, fluency, and wit for the task. These fine gifts brought Lieutenant Porfírio certain benefits: he rarely dined at home on Sundays or on public holidays. You invited Lieutenant Porfírio on the tacit understanding that he would make a speech, just as you would expect a guest who was also a musician to play something.",CO047CL12
4269,29,"Lieutenant Porfírio came between dessert and coffee, and he did not come cheap, either; for if he was a good speaker, he was an even better trencherman. All things considered, his speech was amply paid for by the supper.",CO047CL12
4270,30,"In the three days prior to the wedding, there had been much debate about whether the supper should precede the ceremony or vice versa. The bride’s father felt that the ceremony should come after supper, and he was supported in this by young Rodrigo, who, with a wisdom worthy of a statesman, realized that, otherwise, supper would be very late.",CO047CL12
4271,31,"Dona Beatriz, however, thought it odd to go to church on a full stomach. This view had no theological or disciplinary basis, but Dona Beatriz had her own particular views on church matters, and she prevailed.",CO047CL12
4272,32,"At around four o’clock, the guests began to arrive.",CO047CL12
4273,33,"The first were the Vilela family, comprising Justiniano Vilela, a retired civil servant, Dona Margarida, his wife, and Dona Augusta, their niece.",CO047CL12
4274,34,"Justiniano Vilela’s head—if a breadfruit wearing a very elaborate cravat can be called a head—was an example of nature’s prodigality when it came to making big heads. Some people declared, though, that his talent could not compete in size, even though a rumor to the contrary had been doing the rounds for some time.",CO047CL12
4275,35,"I don’t know what talent those people were talking about, and the word can have various meanings, but Justiniano Vilela had certainly shown great talent in his choice of wife, who, in José Lemos’s opinion, still merited ten minutes of anyone’s attention, even though she was well into her forty-sixth year.",CO047CL12
4276,36,"Justiniano Vilela was dressed as one usually does for such gatherings, and the only truly noteworthy thing about him were his English lace-up shoes, and since he had a horror of overly long trousers, he revealed a pair of fine, immaculate, brilliant white socks whenever he sat down.",CO047CL12
4277,37,"As well as his pension, Justiniano owned a house and two houseboys, and he lived quite well on that. He disliked politics, but had firm opinions about public affairs. He played solo whist and backgammon on alternate days, spoke proudly of how things used to be in his day, and took a pinch of snuff between thumb and middle finger.",CO047CL12
4278,38,"Other guests began arriving, but these were few in number, because only close friends and family would be attending the ceremony and the supper.",CO047CL12
4279,39,"At half-past four, Carlota’s godparents arrived, Dr. Valença and his widowed sister, Dona Virgínia. José Lemos rushed to embrace Dr. Valença, who, being a very formal, ceremonious fellow, gently pushed his friend away, whispering that, on such a day, gravity was of the essence. Then, with a serenity of which only he was capable, Dr. Valença immediately went to greet the mistress of the house and the other ladies.",CO047CL12
4280,40,"He was a man of about fifty, neither fat nor thin, but endowed with a broad chest and an equally broad abdomen, which lent a still greater gravity to his face and manners. The abdomen is the most positive expression of human gravity; a thin man cannot help but make rapid movements, whereas to be seriously grave, one’s movements need to be slow and measured.",CO047CL12
4281,41,A truly grave man should take at least two minutes to take out a handkerchief and blow his nose. Dr. Valença took three minutes when he had a heavy cold and four when he was well. He really was the gravest of men.,CO047CL12
4282,42,"I stress this because it is the best possible proof of Dr. Valença’s intelligence. As soon as he had completed his law degree, he realized that the one quality guaranteed to earn other people’s respect was gravity; and on inquiring into the nature of gravity, it seemed to him that it had nothing to do with profound thoughts or seriousness of mind, but with a certain “mystery of the body,” as La Rochefoucauld calls it, and, the reader will add, mystery is like the flag carried by neutral forces in time of war, ensuring that no one dares to examine the cargo it conceals.",CO047CL12
4283,43,"Anyone discovering so much as a wrinkle in Dr. Valença’s tailcoat could feel well pleased with himself. His vest had only three buttons and formed a kind of heart-shaped opening from chest to neck. An elegant collapsible top hat completed Dr. Valença’s toilette. He was not handsome in the effeminate sense that some apply to male beauty, but there was a certain correctness about the lines of his face, which was covered with a veil of serenity that suited him perfectly.",CO047CL12
4284,44,"Once Dr. Valença and his sister had arrived, José Lemos asked after the bridegroom, but Dr. Valença said he hadn’t seen him. It was five o’clock by then. The guests, who assumed they had arrived too late for the ceremony, were unpleasantly surprised by this delay, and Justiniano Vilela whispered to his wife that he regretted not having had something to eat beforehand. This was precisely what young Rodrigo Lemos was doing, having realized that supper would not start until seven.",CO047CL12
4285,45,"Dr. Valença’s sister—of whom I said but little before because she was one of the most insignificant creatures ever produced by the race of Eve—immediately wanted to go and see the bride, and Dona Beatriz went with her, leaving her husband free to strike up a conversation with Senhor Vilela’s very attractive wife.",CO047CL12
4286,46,"“Bridegrooms today do seem to take their time,” Justiniano remarked philosophically. “When I got married, I was the first to arrive at the bride’s house.”",CO047CL12
4287,47,To this comment—which was entirely the child of Vilela’s implacable stomach—Dr. Valença replied:,CO047CL12
4288,48,“I can perfectly understand the delay and the nervousness one must feel in the presence of one’s bride.”,CO047CL12
4289,49,"Everyone smiled at this defense of the absent groom, and the conversation grew more animated.",CO047CL12
4290,50,"At the very moment when Vilela was discussing with Dr. Valença the advantages of the old days over the present, and the young women were talking about the latest fashions, the bride entered the room, escorted by her mother and godmother, with, bringing up the rear, the very attractive Luísa, accompanied by her little brother, Antonico.",CO047CL12
4291,51,"It would be both inexact of me and in poor taste if I, as narrator, were not to mention that an admiring murmur filled the room.",CO047CL12
4292,52,"Carlota was a truly dazzling sight in her white dress, her garland of orange blossom, her thinnest of thin veils, and wearing no other jewels but her dark eyes, bright as diamonds of the first water.",CO047CL12
4293,53,"José Lemos broke off his conversation with Justiniano’s wife and gazed at his daughter. The bride was introduced to the guests and led over to the sofa, where she sat down between her godparents. Balancing his top hat on his knee and steadying it with one expensively gloved hand, Dr. Valença showered his goddaughter with praise, which made the young woman simultaneously blush and smile—an amiable alliance between vanity and modesty.",CO047CL12
4294,54,"Steps were heard on the stairs, and José Lemos was preparing himself for the arrival of his future son-in-law, when the Valadares brothers appeared at the door.",CO047CL12
4295,55,"Of the two brothers, the oldest, called Calisto, had a sallow complexion, an aquiline nose, brown hair, and round eyes. The younger brother, called Eduardo, only differed from his brother in having a distinctly ruddier complexion. They were both employed by the same company and were in the full bloom of middle age. There was another distinguishing feature: Eduardo wrote poetry when he was allowed time away from the accounts books, while his brother was the enemy of anything that had so much as a whiff of literature about it.",CO047CL12
4296,56,"Time passed, and still no sign of either the groom or Lieutenant Porfírio. The groom was essential to the wedding, and the lieutenant to the supper. It was half-past five when Luís Duarte finally arrived. Each guest sang a private “Hallelujah.”",CO047CL12
4297,57,"He appeared at the door of the parlor and gave a low bow to the assembled guests, so gracefully and ceremoniously that Dr. Valença felt rather envious.",CO047CL12
4298,58,"He was a young man of twenty-five, very fair-skinned, with a blond mustache and no beard at all. He wore his hair parted in the middle. His lips were so red that one of the Valadares brothers whispered to the other: “It looks like he’s wearing lipstick.” In short, Luís Duarte cut a figure guaranteed to please any twenty-year-old girl, and I would have no compunction in calling him an Adonis if he really were one, which he was not.",CO047CL12
4299,59,"At the appointed hour, bride and groom, parents and godparents set off for the church, which was nearby; the other guests remained in the house, with Luísa and Rodrigo doing the honors, although Rodrigo had to be summoned by his father, and duly appeared dressed in the very latest fashion.",CO047CL12
4300,60,"“They’re like a pair of turtledoves,” said Dona Margarida Vilela when the wedding party had left.",CO047CL12
4301,61,"“Very true,” agreed the Valadares brothers and Justiniano Vilela.",CO047CL12
4302,62,"Young Luísa, who was, by nature, a cheerful girl, soon livened up the proceedings, chatting animatedly to the other girls, one of whom she invited to play something on the piano. Calisto Valadares suspected that the Scriptures had made a serious omission in excluding the piano from among the plagues of Egypt. The reader can imagine the look on his face when he saw one of the girls get up and walk over to that vile instrument. He uttered a long sigh and went to study the two engravings purchased the day before.",CO047CL12
4303,63,"“Magnificent!” he said, standing before The Death of Sardanapalus, a painting he loathed.",CO047CL12
4304,64,"“Yes, it was Papa who chose it,” said Rodrigo, and these were the first words he had spoken since entering the room.",CO047CL12
4305,65,"“He obviously has good taste,” said Calisto. “Do you know what the painting is about?”",CO047CL12
4306,66,"“It’s about Sardanapalus,” replied Rodrigo, undeterred.",CO047CL12
4307,67,"“I know that,” retorted Calisto, hoping to continue the conversation, “what I meant was—”",CO047CL12
4308,68,"He could not finish his sentence, because the first chords on the piano rang out.",CO047CL12
4309,69,"Eduardo, who, in his role as poet, was expected to love music, too, strolled over to the piano and leaned on it in the melancholy pose of a man conversing with the muses. Meanwhile, his brother Calisto, finding it impossible to avoid the cascade of notes, went and sat down near Vilela, with whom he struck up conversation, beginning by asking what time it was by his watch. This touched Vilela’s tenderest nerve.",CO047CL12
4310,70,"“It’s getting late,” he said in a faint voice. “Nearly six o’clock.”",CO047CL12
4311,71,“They can’t possibly take much longer.”,CO047CL12
4312,72,“Can’t they! It’s a long ceremony and they might not have been able to find the priest . . . Marriages should be held at home and at night.”,CO047CL12
4313,73,“My feelings exactly.”,CO047CL12
4314,74,"The girl finished playing, and Calisto breathed easily again, while Eduardo, still leaning on the piano, applauded enthusiastically.",CO047CL12
4315,75,“Why don’t you play something else?” he asked.,CO047CL12
4316,76,"“Yes, Mariquinhas, play something from the La Sonnambula,” said Luísa, making her friend sit down again.",CO047CL12
4317,77,"“Yes, La Son—”",CO047CL12
4318,78,"Eduardo did not finish the word; he saw before him his brother’s two disapproving eyes, and winced. Stopping in midsentence and wincing could simply have been the sign of a painful corn. And so everyone thought, except for Vilela, who, assuming the others felt as he did, was convinced that some sharp hunger pang must have interrupted Eduardo’s thoughts.",CO047CL12
4319,79,"And as does sometimes happen, Eduardo’s pain awoke his own, so much so that Vilela’s stomach issued a real ultimatum, to which he succumbed, and, taking advantage of his position as family friend, he wandered off into the house, on the excuse that he needed to stretch his legs.",CO047CL12
4320,80,A marvelous idea.,CO047CL12
4321,81,"The table was already laid with a few inviting titbits, and to Vilela’s eyes it seemed like a veritable cornucopia. Two pastries and a croquette were the palliatives Vilela sent to his rebellious stomach, and his viscera had to make do with that.",CO047CL12
4322,82,"Meanwhile, Dona Mariquinhas was still performing miracles on the piano; Eduardo, now leaning at the window, appeared to be contemplating suicide, while his brother played with his watch chain and listened to Dona Margarida complaining about her feckless slaves. As for Rodrigo, he was pacing up and down, occasionally saying:",CO047CL12
4323,83,"“Goodness, they’re taking their time!”",CO047CL12
4324,84,"It was a quarter past six and still no carriages; some people were already growing impatient. At twenty past six, there was a faint rattle of wheels; Rodrigo ran to the window. It was a passing cab. At twenty-five past six, everyone thought they could hear carriages approaching.",CO047CL12
4325,85,“They’re here!” exclaimed a voice.,CO047CL12
4326,86,But it was nothing. What they heard seemed to be (and forgive me for marrying this noun to this adjective) a kind of aural mirage.,CO047CL12
4327,87,"At six thirty-eight, the carriages arrived. There was great excitement in the parlor; the ladies ran to the windows. The men eyed each other like conspirators gathering their forces for some major undertaking. The wedding party entered. The houseboys, waiting in the hallway for the bride and groom, took their young mistress completely by surprise by showering her with rose petals. And, as there always are on such occasions, many kisses and words of congratulations were given.",CO047CL12
4328,88,"José Lemos was beside himself with joy, but the news that Lieutenant Porfírio had still not arrived put something of a damper on his high spirits.",CO047CL12
4329,89,“We must send for him.”,CO047CL12
4330,90,“At this hour?” murmured Calisto Valadares.,CO047CL12
4331,91,"“Without Porfírio the party won’t be complete,” José Lemos whispered to Dr. Valença.",CO047CL12
4332,92,"“Papa,” said Rodrigo, “I don’t think he’s coming.”",CO047CL12
4333,93,“That’s impossible!”,CO047CL12
4334,94,“It’s nearly seven o’clock.”,CO047CL12
4335,95,"“And supper is ready,” added Dona Beatriz.",CO047CL12
4336,96,"Dona Beatriz’s words carried considerable weight with José Lemos, which is why he did not insist. They had no choice but to give up on the lieutenant.",CO047CL12
4337,97,"However, the lieutenant was a man accustomed to awkward situations, someone you would want on your side in a tight corner. No sooner had Dona Beatriz finished speaking, with José Lemos mentally agreeing with her, than the voice of Lieutenant Porfírio was heard on the stairs. The master of the house gave a sigh of relief and satisfaction. The long-awaited guest entered the room.",CO047CL12
4338,98,"The lieutenant belonged to that happy class of men who are apparently ageless; some thought he was thirty, others thirty-five, and others forty; some even went as high as forty-five, and they could all have been right, for the lieutenant’s face and brown side-whiskers fitted all these hypotheses. He was thin, of medium height, and dressed rather stylishly; indeed, there was really very little to distinguish him from any other dandy.",CO047CL12
4339,99,"The one thing that jarred slightly was his way of walking; Lieutenant Porfírio’s feet were so widely splayed that you could almost draw a straight line between right foot and left. However, everything has its compensations, and in his case, these were the flat patent-leather shoes he wore, revealing a fine pair of woolen socks whose surface was smoother than a billiard ball.",CO047CL12
4340,100,"He entered with a grace that was peculiar to him. To greet the bride and groom, he bent his right arm so that the hand holding his hat was behind his back, then bowed very low, and remained in that posture, so that (from a distance) he resembled one of those old-fashioned lampposts.",CO047CL12
4341,101,"Porfírio had been a lieutenant in the army before being discharged, which suited him perfectly, because he had then gone into the furniture business and made quite a sum of money. He was not particularly good-looking, but, despite this, some ladies said he was more dangerous than a can of dynamite. This was clearly not because of the way he spoke, because he had a particularly sibilant s, saying, for example:",CO047CL12
4342,102,"At your ssservisss, sssenhora . . .",CO047CL12
4343,103,"When Porfírio had finished greeting everyone, José Lemos said to him:",CO047CL12
4344,104,“We’re expecting great things from you tonight!”,CO047CL12
4345,105,"“Ah,” Porfírio responded with exemplary modesty. “Who would dare to speak in the presence of such erudition?”",CO047CL12
4346,106,"He said these words, meanwhile thrusting four fingers of his left hand into his vest pocket, a gesture he cultivated because he did not know what to do with that awkward arm, which is always such a trial to novice actors.",CO047CL12
4347,107,“But why are you so late?” asked Dona Beatriz.,CO047CL12
4348,108,"“Reproach me if you must, dear lady, but spare me the embarrassment of having to explain a delay for which there is no excuse in the code of friendship and good manners.”",CO047CL12
4349,109,"José Lemos smiled and glanced around at the others as if the lieutenant’s words bestowed on him some kind of reflected glory. Despite the pastries he had eaten, Justiniano Vilela still felt ineluctably drawn toward the supper table and exclaimed rather vulgarly:",CO047CL12
4350,110,"“Well, at least you arrived in time for supper!”",CO047CL12
4351,111,"“Yes, let’s all go in, shall we?” said José Lemos, offering an arm each to Dona Margarida and to Dona Virgínia, while the other guests followed behind.",CO047CL12
4352,112,"The joy of pilgrims reaching Mecca could not have been greater than that of the guests when they saw the long table, groaning with roast meats and desserts and fruit and set with china dishes and glasses. They all sat down in their allotted places. For some minutes, there was a silence such as the silence that precedes a battle, and only when this was broken did general conversation begin.",CO047CL12
4353,113,"“When I introduced young Duarte to the household a year ago, who would have thought that he would one day be the delightful Dona Carlota’s bridegroom?” said Dr. Valença, wiping his lips on his napkin and glancing benevolently across at the bride.",CO047CL12
4354,114,"“Yes, who would have thought it?” said Dona Beatriz.",CO047CL12
4355,115,"“It must have been the hand of Fate,” said Dona Margarida.",CO047CL12
4356,116,"“It was indeed,” replied Dona Beatriz.",CO047CL12
4357,117,"“If it was the hand of Fate,” said the groom, “I thank the heavens for taking such an interest in me.”",CO047CL12
4358,118,"Dona Carlota smiled, and José Lemos thought these words in excellent taste and worthy of a son-in-law.",CO047CL12
4359,119,"“Fate or chance?” asked Lieutenant Porfírio. “I favor the latter, myself.”",CO047CL12
4360,120,"“That’s where you’re wrong,” said Vilela, looking up from his plate for the first time. “What you call chance is, in fact, Fate. Weddings and winding sheets are made in heaven.”",CO047CL12
4361,121,"“Oh, so you believe in proverbs, do you?”",CO047CL12
4362,122,"“They contain the wisdom of the people,” said José Lemos.",CO047CL12
4363,123,"“No, they don’t,” said the lieutenant. “For every proverb stating one thing, there’s another stating the opposite. Proverbs lie. I think it was simply a very happy happenstance, or, rather, the law of the attraction of souls that led Senhor Luís Duarte to be drawn to the charming daughter of our very own Amphitryon.”",CO047CL12
4364,124,"José Lemos had no idea who Amphitryon was, but confident that, if Porfírio mentioned him, he must be all right, he smiled and thanked Porfírio for what seemed to be a compliment, meanwhile helping himself to some jelly, which Justiniano Vilela assured him was excellent.",CO047CL12
4365,125,"The young women were whispering and smiling, the bride and groom were absorbed in an exchange of sweet nothings, while Rodrigo was picking his teeth so loudly that his mother shot him one of those fulminating glances that were her weapon of choice.",CO047CL12
4366,126,"“Some jelly, Senhor Calisto?” asked José Lemos, his spoon in the air.",CO047CL12
4367,127,"“Yes, just a little,” said the man with the sallow face.",CO047CL12
4368,128,"“The jelly is excellent,” Justiniano said for the third time, and his wife was so embarrassed by these words that she could not conceal a grimace of distaste.",CO047CL12
4369,129,"“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Dr. Valença, “I propose a toast to the happy couple.”",CO047CL12
4370,130,“Bravo!” said a voice.,CO047CL12
4371,131,“Is that it?” asked Rodrigo. “We want a longer toast than that.”,CO047CL12
4372,132,"“Mama, I want some jelly!” said Antonico.",CO047CL12
4373,133,“I’m not one for making speeches. I am simply raising my glass to the bride and groom.”,CO047CL12
4374,134,Everyone drank.,CO047CL12
4375,135,“I want jelly!” insisted Antonico.,CO047CL12
4376,136,"Dona Beatriz felt her inner Medea stirring within her, but respect for her guests prevented any unpleasant scene. The good lady merely said to one of the servants:",CO047CL12
4377,137,"“Give this to the young master, will you?”",CO047CL12
4378,138,"Antonico received the dish and began eating the way children eat when they’re not really hungry: he would raise a spoonful to his mouth and spend an age rolling the contents of the spoon around between tongue and palate, while the spoon, pushed to one side, formed a slight lump in his right cheek. At the same time, he kept kicking his legs, repeatedly hitting first the chair and then the table.",CO047CL12
4379,139,"While this was going on—not that anyone took much notice—the conversation continued. Dr. Valença was discussing with one lady the excellence of the sherry, and Eduardo Valadares was reciting a poem to the young woman sitting next to him.",CO047CL12
4380,140,Suddenly José Lemos stood up.,CO047CL12
4381,141,“Ssshh!” hissed everyone.,CO047CL12
4382,142,José Lemos picked up a glass and said to those around the table:,CO047CL12
4383,143,"“I am not prompted to speak by any feeling of pride to be addressing such an illustrious audience. I am responding to the higher duty of courtesy, friendship, and gratitude, that most preeminent, sacred, and immortal of duties.”",CO047CL12
4384,144,"The audience would have been cruel indeed not to applaud these words, and their applause did not ruffle the speaker in the least, for the simple reason that he knew the speech by heart.",CO047CL12
4385,145,"“Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I bow before that duty, the holiest and most imperious of all duties. I drink to my friends, to those steadfast adherents of the heart, those vestal virgins, both male and female, devotees of the pure flame of friendship! To my friends! To friendship!”",CO047CL12
4386,146,"To be honest, the only person who understood the utter nullity of José Lemos’s speech was Dr. Valença, who was himself no intellectual, which is why he rose to propose a toast to their host’s oratorical talents.",CO047CL12
4387,147,"These two toasts were followed by the customary silence, until Rodrigo turned to Lieutenant Porfírio and asked if he had perhaps left his muse at home.",CO047CL12
4388,148,"“Yes,” said one lady, “we want to hear you. People say you speak really well.”",CO047CL12
4389,149,"“Me, senhora?” replied Porfírio with all the modesty of a man who believes himself to be another golden-mouthed Saint John Chrysostom.",CO047CL12
4390,150,"Once the champagne had been poured and handed around, Lieutenant Porfírio stood up. Vilela, who was some distance away, cupped one hand behind his right ear, while Calisto, fixing his eyes firmly on the tablecloth, appeared to be counting every thread. José Lemos alerted his wife, who, at that moment, was trying to tempt the implacable Antonico with a sweet chestnut; all other eyes were on the speaker.",CO047CL12
4391,151,"“Ladies! Gentlemen!” said Porfírio. “I do not intend to rummage around in the very heart of history, that teacher of life, to find out what marriage was like in the earliest ages of humankind. We all know, ladies and gentlemen, what marriage is. Marriage is the rose, the queen of the garden, unfurling its red petals in order to protect us from the thistles and thorns and barbs of life . . .”",CO047CL12
4392,152,“Bravo!”,CO047CL12
4393,153,“Delightful!”,CO047CL12
4394,154,"“If marriage is what I have just revealed to your auricular senses, there is no need to explain the joy, the fervor, the loving impulse, the explosions of sentiment felt by all of us seated here around this altar to celebrate our dear and much-loved friend.”",CO047CL12
4395,155,"José Lemos bowed his head so low that the tip of his nose touched a pear that lay in front of him on the table, and Dona Beatriz turned to Dr. Valença, who was sitting beside her, and said:",CO047CL12
4396,156,“Doesn’t he speak well! He’s like a walking dictionary!”,CO047CL12
4397,157,Porfírio went on:,CO047CL12
4398,158,"“I fear, ladies and gentlemen, that I lack the necessary talent to speak on the subject . . .”",CO047CL12
4399,159,“Nonsense! You speak really well!” cried many of the people surrounding him.,CO047CL12
4400,160,"“You are far too kind, but I still do not feel I have the necessary talent to grapple with a subject of such magnitude.”",CO047CL12
4401,161,“Nonsense!”,CO047CL12
4402,162,"“Please, you’re too kind,” said Porfírio, bowing. “While, as I say, I may lack that particular talent, I have more than enough goodwill, the same goodwill that led the Apostles to plant the religion of Calvary in the world, and thanks to that same feeling, I can sum up in just a few words my toast to the happy couple.",CO047CL12
4403,163,"Ladies and gentlemen, two flowers were born in two different flower beds, both of them beautiful, both highly scented, both full of divine life. They were born for each other; they were the carnation and the rose; the rose lived only for the carnation, the carnation lived only for the rose: along came a breeze and mingled the perfumes of the two flowers, and they, knowing they were in love, ran to meet each other. The breeze was godfather to that union. The rose and the carnation are united in the embrace of love, and sitting over there is the breeze honoring our gathering here tonight.”",CO047CL12
4404,164,No one was expecting this breeze; the breeze was Dr. Valença.,CO047CL12
4405,165,Loud applause greeted this speech combining Calvary with the carnation and the rose. Porfírio sat down with a sense of having done his duty. Supper was coming to an end; it was half-past eight; a few musicians were arriving in readiness for the ball. Still to come was a poem by Eduardo Valadares and a few more toasts to all those present and to those few who were absent.,CO047CL12
4406,166,"Now, with the liqueurs coming to the aid of the muses, battle was engaged between Lieutenant Porfírio and Justiniano Vilela, although the latter had to be urged to enter the arena. Once all subjects for debate had been exhausted, Porfírio proposed a toast to the army and its generals, and Vilela a toast to the union of all the provinces of the empire. When everyone else got up from the table, the two of them remained behind, warmly toasting all the practical and useful ideas of this world and the next.",CO047CL12
4407,167,The ball that followed was a very lively affair that went on until three in the morning.,CO047CL12
4408,168,"No untoward incident marred the party. At most, there was a rather regrettable remark made by José Lemos when dancing with Dona Margarida, during which he boldly lamented her fate at having a husband who preferred proposing endless toasts to enjoying the priceless good fortune of being by her side. Dona Margarida smiled, and the incident went no further.",CO047CL12
4409,169,"At two o’clock, Dr. Valença left with his family, and, despite the generally familiar tone of the party, he had not lost one iota of his habitual gravity all evening. Calisto Valadares escaped when Dona Beatriz’s younger daughter got up to sing at the piano, and the other guests gradually drifted away.",CO047CL12
4410,170,"When the party finally drew to a close, the last two tribal leaders of the dining table were still toasting all and sundry. Vilela’s final toast was to the world’s progress via coffee and cotton, while Porfírio raised his glass to universal peace.",CO047CL12
4411,171,"However, the real toast of that memorable feast was the little baby born in January of the following year, who, if he survives his teething pains, will live to continue the Lemos dynasty.",CO047CL12

4413,2,"ON APRIL 25, a Saturday morning, José Lemos’s house was in total uproar. The dinner service that was only used on special occasions was being brought out, stairs and hallways were being scrubbed, and suckling pigs and turkeys were being stuffed ready to be roasted in the baker’s oven across the road; there was no rest for anyone; something of great importance was about to happen.",CO047CL10
4414,3,"José Lemos was in charge of sorting out the parlor. Perched on a bench, the worthy master of the house was attempting to hang the two engravings he had bought the day before from Bernasconi’s; one depicted The Death of Sardanapalus, the other The Execution of Mary Stuart. He and his wife were having a bit of a battle about where to hang the first engraving.",CO047CL10
4415,4,"Dona Beatriz thought it indecent, all those men embracing a lot of naked women. Besides, such gloomy subjects were hardly suitable for a celebration. José Lemos had been a member of a literary society in his youth, and replied loftily that these were historical paintings, and that history had a place in every family. He might have added that not every family had a place in history, but that little joke was in even poorer taste than the engravings.",CO047CL10
4416,5,"Keys in hand, but not quite as disheveled as the lady in Tolentino’s famous satirical sonnet, Dona Beatriz was bustling back and forth between parlor and kitchen, issuing orders, chivying the slaves, gathering up clean tablecloths and napkins, and dictating shopping lists; in short, dealing with the thousand and one things that every mistress of the house has to deal with, especially on such an important day.",CO047CL10
4417,6,"Now and then, Dona Beatriz would go to the foot of the stairs and shout:",CO047CL10
4418,7,"“Girls, come down and have your breakfast!”",CO047CL10
4419,8,"It seems, though, that the girls were in no hurry, because they only obeyed their mother’s summons when it was past nine o’clock, and she had already called up to them eight times and was even about to climb the stairs to their bedroom—quite a sacrifice for such a plump lady.",CO047CL10
4420,9,"The Lemos girls were two dark-haired beauties. One was about twenty, the other seventeen; both were tall and slightly overdressed. The older girl looked somewhat pale, while the other, pink-cheeked and cheerful, came down the stairs singing a popular ballad of the time. Of the two, it would seem that she was the happier one, but this was not the case; the happier sister was the older girl, who, that very day, was to tie the knot with young Luís Duarte, after a long and persistent courtship.",CO047CL10
4421,10,"She was pale because she had barely slept, even though she had never before suffered from insomnia, but then some illnesses do just come and go.",CO047CL10
4422,11,"The two girls came downstairs, received their mother’s blessing as well as a brief telling-off, then went into the parlor to talk to their father. José Lemos, who had just changed the position of the pictures for the seventh time, asked his daughters whether the engraving of Mary Stuart would be better on this side of the sofa or on the other. The girls said it would be best left where it was, and this verdict put an end to all José Lemos’s doubts, and, deeming his work to be done, he went off to have his breakfast.",CO047CL10
4423,12,"Also seated at the breakfast table, along with José Lemos, Dona Beatriz, Carlota (the bride), and Luísa, were Rodrigo Lemos and little Antonico, the Lemoses’ two sons. Rodrigo was eighteen and Antonico six; Antonico was a miniature version of Rodrigo, with whom he shared another brotherly trait, that of extreme idleness.",CO047CL10
4424,13,"From eight o’clock in the morning on, Rodrigo was to be found doing one of two things: either reading the advertisements in the newspaper or going into the kitchen to find out when breakfast would be served. As for Antonico, he, as usual, had eaten a large plate of porridge at six o’clock, and then slept peacefully until the nursemaid called him.",CO047CL10
4425,14,"Breakfast passed without incident. José Lemos preferred not to talk while he was eating; Rodrigo recounted the plot of the play he had seen the previous night at the Ginásio; and that was the sole topic of conversation. When breakfast was over, Rodrigo got up to smoke a cigarette, and José Lemos leaned his elbows on the table, peered out at the rather ominous sky over toward Tijuca, and asked if it looked as if rain were likely.",CO047CL10
4426,15,"Antonico was just about to leave the table, having first asked permission, when his mother issued this warning:",CO047CL10
4427,16,"“Now, Antonico, at supper, I don’t want you to do what you always do when there are strangers here.”",CO047CL10
4428,17,“What’s that?” asked José Lemos.,CO047CL10
4429,18,"“He gets all embarrassed and sticks his finger up his nose. Only silly boys do that, and I don’t like it.”",CO047CL10
4430,19,"Deeply humiliated, Antonico ran into the parlor in floods of tears, Dona Beatriz hurried after her youngest child to comfort him, and everyone else left the table.",CO047CL10
4431,20,"José Lemos checked with his wife that no one had been omitted from the guest list, and, having established that everyone who should have been invited was there, he prepared to go out. He was immediately given various errands: to ask the hairdresser to come early, to buy gloves for his wife and his daughters, to make sure the carriages were ready, to order ice cream and wines, and certain other tasks in which he could have been helped by young Rodrigo, had that namesake of El Cid not gone upstairs to sleep off breakfast.",CO047CL10
4432,21,"No sooner had the soles of José Lemos’s shoes touched the cobbled street outside than Dona Beatriz instructed her daughter Carlota to follow her into the parlor, where she immediately addressed her as follows:",CO047CL10
4433,22,"“Today, my dear, your life as a single woman will end, and tomorrow, married life will begin. Having undergone the same transformation myself, I know from personal experience that being married brings with it many heavy responsibilities. Obviously, every woman must learn for herself, but I am following the example of your grandmother, who, on the eve of my marriage to your father, set out in clear and simple language what it means to be married and the great responsibility involved in this new role . . .”",CO047CL10
4434,23,"Dona Beatriz stopped speaking, and Carlota, attributing her mother’s silence to a desire for some response, said nothing, but planted a fond, filial kiss on her mother’s cheek.",CO047CL10
4435,24,"Had Luís Duarte’s bride peered through the keyhole of her father’s study only three days before, she would have realized that Dona Beatriz was reciting a speech composed by José Lemos, and that her silence was merely a temporary memory lapse.",CO047CL10
4436,25,"It would have been far better had Dona Beatriz, like other mothers, offered advice drawn from her own heart and experience. Maternal love is the best rhetoric in the world, but Senhor José Lemos, who, ever since he was a young man, had preserved a certain literary bent, felt that, on such a solemn occasion, it would be wrong to run the risk of his better half making any grammatical errors.",CO047CL10
4437,26,"Dona Beatriz resumed her speech, which was not that long, and concluded by asking if Carlota really did love her fiancé and was not, as did occasionally happen, getting married out of pique. Carlota replied that she loved her fiancé as dearly as she loved her parents, and the mother then kissed her daughter with a tenderness not provided for in José Lemos’s prose.",CO047CL10
4438,27,"At about two o’clock in the afternoon, José Lemos returned, dripping with sweat, but feeling very pleased with himself, because, as well as carrying out all his wife’s errands as regards carriages, hairdressers, etc., he had managed to persuade Lieutenant Porfírio to join them for supper, something which, up until then, had been by no means certain.",CO047CL10
4439,28,"Lieutenant Porfírio was what you might call an after-dinner speaker, possessing, as he did, the necessary confidence, fluency, and wit for the task. These fine gifts brought Lieutenant Porfírio certain benefits: he rarely dined at home on Sundays or on public holidays. You invited Lieutenant Porfírio on the tacit understanding that he would make a speech, just as you would expect a guest who was also a musician to play something.",CO047CL10
4440,29,"Lieutenant Porfírio came between dessert and coffee, and he did not come cheap, either; for if he was a good speaker, he was an even better trencherman. All things considered, his speech was amply paid for by the supper.",CO047CL10
4441,30,"In the three days prior to the wedding, there had been much debate about whether the supper should precede the ceremony or vice versa. The bride’s father felt that the ceremony should come after supper, and he was supported in this by young Rodrigo, who, with a wisdom worthy of a statesman, realized that, otherwise, supper would be very late. Dona Beatriz, however, thought it odd to go to church on a full stomach. This view had no theological or disciplinary basis, but Dona Beatriz had her own particular views on church matters, and she prevailed.",CO047CL10

4443,32,"At around four o’clock, the guests began to arrive.",CO047CL10
4444,33,"The first were the Vilela family, comprising Justiniano Vilela, a retired civil servant, Dona Margarida, his wife, and Dona Augusta, their niece.",CO047CL10
4445,34,"Justiniano Vilela’s head—if a breadfruit wearing a very elaborate cravat can be called a head—was an example of nature’s prodigality when it came to making big heads. Some people declared, though, that his talent could not compete in size, even though a rumor to the contrary had been doing the rounds for some time.",CO047CL10
4446,35,"I don’t know what talent those people were talking about, and the word can have various meanings, but Justiniano Vilela had certainly shown great talent in his choice of wife, who, in José Lemos’s opinion, still merited ten minutes of anyone’s attention, even though she was well into her forty-sixth year.",CO047CL10
4447,36,"Justiniano Vilela was dressed as one usually does for such gatherings, and the only truly noteworthy thing about him were his English lace-up shoes, and since he had a horror of overly long trousers, he revealed a pair of fine, immaculate, brilliant white socks whenever he sat down.",CO047CL10
4448,37,"As well as his pension, Justiniano owned a house and two houseboys, and he lived quite well on that. He disliked politics, but had firm opinions about public affairs. He played solo whist and backgammon on alternate days, spoke proudly of how things used to be in his day, and took a pinch of snuff between thumb and middle finger.",CO047CL10
4449,38,"Other guests began arriving, but these were few in number, because only close friends and family would be attending the ceremony and the supper.",CO047CL10
4450,39,"At half-past four, Carlota’s godparents arrived, Dr. Valença and his widowed sister, Dona Virgínia. José Lemos rushed to embrace Dr. Valença, who, being a very formal, ceremonious fellow, gently pushed his friend away, whispering that, on such a day, gravity was of the essence. Then, with a serenity of which only he was capable, Dr. Valença immediately went to greet the mistress of the house and the other ladies.",CO047CL10
4451,40,"He was a man of about fifty, neither fat nor thin, but endowed with a broad chest and an equally broad abdomen, which lent a still greater gravity to his face and manners. The abdomen is the most positive expression of human gravity; a thin man cannot help but make rapid movements, whereas to be seriously grave, one’s movements need to be slow and measured.",CO047CL10
4452,41,A truly grave man should take at least two minutes to take out a handkerchief and blow his nose. Dr. Valença took three minutes when he had a heavy cold and four when he was well. He really was the gravest of men.,CO047CL10
4453,42,"I stress this because it is the best possible proof of Dr. Valença’s intelligence. As soon as he had completed his law degree, he realized that the one quality guaranteed to earn other people’s respect was gravity; and on inquiring into the nature of gravity, it seemed to him that it had nothing to do with profound thoughts or seriousness of mind, but with a certain “mystery of the body,” as La Rochefoucauld calls it, and, the reader will add, mystery is like the flag carried by neutral forces in time of war, ensuring that no one dares to examine the cargo it conceals.",CO047CL10
4454,43,"Anyone discovering so much as a wrinkle in Dr. Valença’s tailcoat could feel well pleased with himself. His vest had only three buttons and formed a kind of heart-shaped opening from chest to neck. An elegant collapsible top hat completed Dr. Valença’s toilette. He was not handsome in the effeminate sense that some apply to male beauty, but there was a certain correctness about the lines of his face, which was covered with a veil of serenity that suited him perfectly.",CO047CL10
4455,44,"Once Dr. Valença and his sister had arrived, José Lemos asked after the bridegroom, but Dr. Valença said he hadn’t seen him. It was five o’clock by then. The guests, who assumed they had arrived too late for the ceremony, were unpleasantly surprised by this delay, and Justiniano Vilela whispered to his wife that he regretted not having had something to eat beforehand. This was precisely what young Rodrigo Lemos was doing, having realized that supper would not start until seven.",CO047CL10
4456,45,"Dr. Valença’s sister—of whom I said but little before because she was one of the most insignificant creatures ever produced by the race of Eve—immediately wanted to go and see the bride, and Dona Beatriz went with her, leaving her husband free to strike up a conversation with Senhor Vilela’s very attractive wife.",CO047CL10
4457,46,"“Bridegrooms today do seem to take their time,” Justiniano remarked philosophically. “When I got married, I was the first to arrive at the bride’s house.”",CO047CL10
4458,47,To this comment—which was entirely the child of Vilela’s implacable stomach—Dr. Valença replied:,CO047CL10
4459,48,“I can perfectly understand the delay and the nervousness one must feel in the presence of one’s bride.”,CO047CL10
4460,49,"Everyone smiled at this defense of the absent groom, and the conversation grew more animated.",CO047CL10
4461,50,"At the very moment when Vilela was discussing with Dr. Valença the advantages of the old days over the present, and the young women were talking about the latest fashions, the bride entered the room, escorted by her mother and godmother, with, bringing up the rear, the very attractive Luísa, accompanied by her little brother, Antonico.",CO047CL10
4462,51,"It would be both inexact of me and in poor taste if I, as narrator, were not to mention that an admiring murmur filled the room.",CO047CL10
4463,52,"Carlota was a truly dazzling sight in her white dress, her garland of orange blossom, her thinnest of thin veils, and wearing no other jewels but her dark eyes, bright as diamonds of the first water.",CO047CL10
4464,53,"José Lemos broke off his conversation with Justiniano’s wife and gazed at his daughter. The bride was introduced to the guests and led over to the sofa, where she sat down between her godparents. Balancing his top hat on his knee and steadying it with one expensively gloved hand, Dr. Valença showered his goddaughter with praise, which made the young woman simultaneously blush and smile—an amiable alliance between vanity and modesty.",CO047CL10
4465,54,"Steps were heard on the stairs, and José Lemos was preparing himself for the arrival of his future son-in-law, when the Valadares brothers appeared at the door.",CO047CL10
4466,55,"Of the two brothers, the oldest, called Calisto, had a sallow complexion, an aquiline nose, brown hair, and round eyes. The younger brother, called Eduardo, only differed from his brother in having a distinctly ruddier complexion. They were both employed by the same company and were in the full bloom of middle age. There was another distinguishing feature: Eduardo wrote poetry when he was allowed time away from the accounts books, while his brother was the enemy of anything that had so much as a whiff of literature about it.",CO047CL10
4467,56,"Time passed, and still no sign of either the groom or Lieutenant Porfírio. The groom was essential to the wedding, and the lieutenant to the supper. It was half-past five when Luís Duarte finally arrived. Each guest sang a private “Hallelujah.”",CO047CL10
4468,57,"He appeared at the door of the parlor and gave a low bow to the assembled guests, so gracefully and ceremoniously that Dr. Valença felt rather envious.",CO047CL10
4469,58,"He was a young man of twenty-five, very fair-skinned, with a blond mustache and no beard at all. He wore his hair parted in the middle. His lips were so red that one of the Valadares brothers whispered to the other: “It looks like he’s wearing lipstick.” In short, Luís Duarte cut a figure guaranteed to please any twenty-year-old girl, and I would have no compunction in calling him an Adonis if he really were one, which he was not.",CO047CL10
4470,59,"At the appointed hour, bride and groom, parents and godparents set off for the church, which was nearby; the other guests remained in the house, with Luísa and Rodrigo doing the honors, although Rodrigo had to be summoned by his father, and duly appeared dressed in the very latest fashion.",CO047CL10
4471,60,"“They’re like a pair of turtledoves,” said Dona Margarida Vilela when the wedding party had left.",CO047CL10
4472,61,"“Very true,” agreed the Valadares brothers and Justiniano Vilela.",CO047CL10
4473,62,"Young Luísa, who was, by nature, a cheerful girl, soon livened up the proceedings, chatting animatedly to the other girls, one of whom she invited to play something on the piano. Calisto Valadares suspected that the Scriptures had made a serious omission in excluding the piano from among the plagues of Egypt. The reader can imagine the look on his face when he saw one of the girls get up and walk over to that vile instrument. He uttered a long sigh and went to study the two engravings purchased the day before.",CO047CL10
4474,63,"“Magnificent!” he said, standing before The Death of Sardanapalus, a painting he loathed.",CO047CL10
4475,64,"“Yes, it was Papa who chose it,” said Rodrigo, and these were the first words he had spoken since entering the room.",CO047CL10
4476,65,"“He obviously has good taste,” said Calisto. “Do you know what the painting is about?”",CO047CL10
4477,66,"“It’s about Sardanapalus,” replied Rodrigo, undeterred.",CO047CL10
4478,67,"“I know that,” retorted Calisto, hoping to continue the conversation, “what I meant was—”",CO047CL10
4479,68,"He could not finish his sentence, because the first chords on the piano rang out.",CO047CL10
4480,69,"Eduardo, who, in his role as poet, was expected to love music, too, strolled over to the piano and leaned on it in the melancholy pose of a man conversing with the muses. Meanwhile, his brother Calisto, finding it impossible to avoid the cascade of notes, went and sat down near Vilela, with whom he struck up conversation, beginning by asking what time it was by his watch. This touched Vilela’s tenderest nerve.",CO047CL10
4481,70,"“It’s getting late,” he said in a faint voice. “Nearly six o’clock.”",CO047CL10
4482,71,“They can’t possibly take much longer.”,CO047CL10
4483,72,“Can’t they! It’s a long ceremony and they might not have been able to find the priest . . . Marriages should be held at home and at night.”,CO047CL10
4484,73,“My feelings exactly.”,CO047CL10
4485,74,"The girl finished playing, and Calisto breathed easily again, while Eduardo, still leaning on the piano, applauded enthusiastically.",CO047CL10
4486,75,“Why don’t you play something else?” he asked.,CO047CL10
4487,76,"“Yes, Mariquinhas, play something from the La Sonnambula,” said Luísa, making her friend sit down again.",CO047CL10
4488,77,"“Yes, La Son—”",CO047CL10
4489,78,"Eduardo did not finish the word; he saw before him his brother’s two disapproving eyes, and winced. Stopping in midsentence and wincing could simply have been the sign of a painful corn. And so everyone thought, except for Vilela, who, assuming the others felt as he did, was convinced that some sharp hunger pang must have interrupted Eduardo’s thoughts.",CO047CL10
4490,79,"And as does sometimes happen, Eduardo’s pain awoke his own, so much so that Vilela’s stomach issued a real ultimatum, to which he succumbed, and, taking advantage of his position as family friend, he wandered off into the house, on the excuse that he needed to stretch his legs.",CO047CL10
4491,80,A marvelous idea.,CO047CL10
4492,81,"The table was already laid with a few inviting titbits, and to Vilela’s eyes it seemed like a veritable cornucopia. Two pastries and a croquette were the palliatives Vilela sent to his rebellious stomach, and his viscera had to make do with that.",CO047CL10
4493,82,"Meanwhile, Dona Mariquinhas was still performing miracles on the piano; Eduardo, now leaning at the window, appeared to be contemplating suicide, while his brother played with his watch chain and listened to Dona Margarida complaining about her feckless slaves. As for Rodrigo, he was pacing up and down, occasionally saying:",CO047CL10
4494,83,"“Goodness, they’re taking their time!”",CO047CL10
4495,84,"It was a quarter past six and still no carriages; some people were already growing impatient. At twenty past six, there was a faint rattle of wheels; Rodrigo ran to the window. It was a passing cab. At twenty-five past six, everyone thought they could hear carriages approaching.",CO047CL10
4496,85,“They’re here!” exclaimed a voice.,CO047CL10
4497,86,But it was nothing. What they heard seemed to be (and forgive me for marrying this noun to this adjective) a kind of aural mirage.,CO047CL10
4498,87,"At six thirty-eight, the carriages arrived. There was great excitement in the parlor; the ladies ran to the windows. The men eyed each other like conspirators gathering their forces for some major undertaking. The wedding party entered. The houseboys, waiting in the hallway for the bride and groom, took their young mistress completely by surprise by showering her with rose petals. And, as there always are on such occasions, many kisses and words of congratulations were given.",CO047CL10
4499,88,"José Lemos was beside himself with joy, but the news that Lieutenant Porfírio had still not arrived put something of a damper on his high spirits.",CO047CL10
4500,89,“We must send for him.”,CO047CL10
4501,90,“At this hour?” murmured Calisto Valadares.,CO047CL10
4502,91,"“Without Porfírio the party won’t be complete,” José Lemos whispered to Dr. Valença.",CO047CL10
4503,92,"“Papa,” said Rodrigo, “I don’t think he’s coming.”",CO047CL10
4504,93,“That’s impossible!”,CO047CL10
4505,94,“It’s nearly seven o’clock.”,CO047CL10
4506,95,"“And supper is ready,” added Dona Beatriz.",CO047CL10
4507,96,"Dona Beatriz’s words carried considerable weight with José Lemos, which is why he did not insist. They had no choice but to give up on the lieutenant.",CO047CL10
4508,97,"However, the lieutenant was a man accustomed to awkward situations, someone you would want on your side in a tight corner. No sooner had Dona Beatriz finished speaking, with José Lemos mentally agreeing with her, than the voice of Lieutenant Porfírio was heard on the stairs. The master of the house gave a sigh of relief and satisfaction. The long-awaited guest entered the room.",CO047CL10
4509,98,"The lieutenant belonged to that happy class of men who are apparently ageless; some thought he was thirty, others thirty-five, and others forty; some even went as high as forty-five, and they could all have been right, for the lieutenant’s face and brown side-whiskers fitted all these hypotheses. He was thin, of medium height, and dressed rather stylishly; indeed, there was really very little to distinguish him from any other dandy.",CO047CL10
4510,99,"The one thing that jarred slightly was his way of walking; Lieutenant Porfírio’s feet were so widely splayed that you could almost draw a straight line between right foot and left. However, everything has its compensations, and in his case, these were the flat patent-leather shoes he wore, revealing a fine pair of woolen socks whose surface was smoother than a billiard ball.",CO047CL10
4511,100,"He entered with a grace that was peculiar to him. To greet the bride and groom, he bent his right arm so that the hand holding his hat was behind his back, then bowed very low, and remained in that posture, so that (from a distance) he resembled one of those old-fashioned lampposts.",CO047CL10
4512,101,"Porfírio had been a lieutenant in the army before being discharged, which suited him perfectly, because he had then gone into the furniture business and made quite a sum of money. He was not particularly good-looking, but, despite this, some ladies said he was more dangerous than a can of dynamite. This was clearly not because of the way he spoke, because he had a particularly sibilant s, saying, for example:",CO047CL10
4513,102,"At your ssservisss, sssenhora . . .",CO047CL10
4514,103,"When Porfírio had finished greeting everyone, José Lemos said to him:",CO047CL10
4515,104,“We’re expecting great things from you tonight!”,CO047CL10
4516,105,"“Ah,” Porfírio responded with exemplary modesty. “Who would dare to speak in the presence of such erudition?”",CO047CL10
4517,106,"He said these words, meanwhile thrusting four fingers of his left hand into his vest pocket, a gesture he cultivated because he did not know what to do with that awkward arm, which is always such a trial to novice actors.",CO047CL10
4518,107,“But why are you so late?” asked Dona Beatriz.,CO047CL10
4519,108,"“Reproach me if you must, dear lady, but spare me the embarrassment of having to explain a delay for which there is no excuse in the code of friendship and good manners.”",CO047CL10
4520,109,"José Lemos smiled and glanced around at the others as if the lieutenant’s words bestowed on him some kind of reflected glory. Despite the pastries he had eaten, Justiniano Vilela still felt ineluctably drawn toward the supper table and exclaimed rather vulgarly:",CO047CL10
4521,110,"“Well, at least you arrived in time for supper!”",CO047CL10
4522,111,"“Yes, let’s all go in, shall we?” said José Lemos, offering an arm each to Dona Margarida and to Dona Virgínia, while the other guests followed behind.",CO047CL10
4523,112,"The joy of pilgrims reaching Mecca could not have been greater than that of the guests when they saw the long table, groaning with roast meats and desserts and fruit and set with china dishes and glasses. They all sat down in their allotted places. For some minutes, there was a silence such as the silence that precedes a battle, and only when this was broken did general conversation begin.",CO047CL10
4524,113,"“When I introduced young Duarte to the household a year ago, who would have thought that he would one day be the delightful Dona Carlota’s bridegroom?” said Dr. Valença, wiping his lips on his napkin and glancing benevolently across at the bride.",CO047CL10
4525,114,"“Yes, who would have thought it?” said Dona Beatriz.",CO047CL10
4526,115,"“It must have been the hand of Fate,” said Dona Margarida.",CO047CL10
4527,116,"“It was indeed,” replied Dona Beatriz.",CO047CL10
4528,117,"“If it was the hand of Fate,” said the groom, “I thank the heavens for taking such an interest in me.”",CO047CL10
4529,118,"Dona Carlota smiled, and José Lemos thought these words in excellent taste and worthy of a son-in-law.",CO047CL10
4530,119,"“Fate or chance?” asked Lieutenant Porfírio. “I favor the latter, myself.”",CO047CL10
4531,120,"“That’s where you’re wrong,” said Vilela, looking up from his plate for the first time. “What you call chance is, in fact, Fate. Weddings and winding sheets are made in heaven.”",CO047CL10
4532,121,"“Oh, so you believe in proverbs, do you?”",CO047CL10
4533,122,"“They contain the wisdom of the people,” said José Lemos.",CO047CL10
4534,123,"“No, they don’t,” said the lieutenant. “For every proverb stating one thing, there’s another stating the opposite. Proverbs lie. I think it was simply a very happy happenstance, or, rather, the law of the attraction of souls that led Senhor Luís Duarte to be drawn to the charming daughter of our very own Amphitryon.”",CO047CL10
4535,124,"José Lemos had no idea who Amphitryon was, but confident that, if Porfírio mentioned him, he must be all right, he smiled and thanked Porfírio for what seemed to be a compliment, meanwhile helping himself to some jelly, which Justiniano Vilela assured him was excellent.",CO047CL10
4536,125,"The young women were whispering and smiling, the bride and groom were absorbed in an exchange of sweet nothings, while Rodrigo was picking his teeth so loudly that his mother shot him one of those fulminating glances that were her weapon of choice.",CO047CL10
4537,126,"“Some jelly, Senhor Calisto?” asked José Lemos, his spoon in the air.",CO047CL10
4538,127,"“Yes, just a little,” said the man with the sallow face.",CO047CL10
4539,128,"“The jelly is excellent,” Justiniano said for the third time, and his wife was so embarrassed by these words that she could not conceal a grimace of distaste.",CO047CL10
4540,129,"“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Dr. Valença, “I propose a toast to the happy couple.”",CO047CL10
4541,130,“Bravo!” said a voice.,CO047CL10
4542,131,“Is that it?” asked Rodrigo. “We want a longer toast than that.”,CO047CL10
4543,132,"“Mama, I want some jelly!” said Antonico.",CO047CL10
4544,133,“I’m not one for making speeches. I am simply raising my glass to the bride and groom.”,CO047CL10
4545,134,Everyone drank.,CO047CL10
4546,135,“I want jelly!” insisted Antonico.,CO047CL10
4547,136,"Dona Beatriz felt her inner Medea stirring within her, but respect for her guests prevented any unpleasant scene. The good lady merely said to one of the servants:",CO047CL10
4548,137,"“Give this to the young master, will you?”",CO047CL10
4549,138,"Antonico received the dish and began eating the way children eat when they’re not really hungry: he would raise a spoonful to his mouth and spend an age rolling the contents of the spoon around between tongue and palate, while the spoon, pushed to one side, formed a slight lump in his right cheek. At the same time, he kept kicking his legs, repeatedly hitting first the chair and then the table.",CO047CL10
4550,139,"While this was going on—not that anyone took much notice—the conversation continued. Dr. Valença was discussing with one lady the excellence of the sherry, and Eduardo Valadares was reciting a poem to the young woman sitting next to him.",CO047CL10
4551,140,Suddenly José Lemos stood up.,CO047CL10
4552,141,“Ssshh!” hissed everyone.,CO047CL10
4553,142,José Lemos picked up a glass and said to those around the table:,CO047CL10
4554,143,"“I am not prompted to speak by any feeling of pride to be addressing such an illustrious audience. I am responding to the higher duty of courtesy, friendship, and gratitude, that most preeminent, sacred, and immortal of duties.”",CO047CL10
4555,144,"The audience would have been cruel indeed not to applaud these words, and their applause did not ruffle the speaker in the least, for the simple reason that he knew the speech by heart.",CO047CL10
4556,145,"“Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I bow before that duty, the holiest and most imperious of all duties. I drink to my friends, to those steadfast adherents of the heart, those vestal virgins, both male and female, devotees of the pure flame of friendship! To my friends! To friendship!”",CO047CL10
4557,146,"To be honest, the only person who understood the utter nullity of José Lemos’s speech was Dr. Valença, who was himself no intellectual, which is why he rose to propose a toast to their host’s oratorical talents.",CO047CL10
4558,147,"These two toasts were followed by the customary silence, until Rodrigo turned to Lieutenant Porfírio and asked if he had perhaps left his muse at home.",CO047CL10
4559,148,"“Yes,” said one lady, “we want to hear you. People say you speak really well.”",CO047CL10
4560,149,"“Me, senhora?” replied Porfírio with all the modesty of a man who believes himself to be another golden-mouthed Saint John Chrysostom.",CO047CL10
4561,150,"Once the champagne had been poured and handed around, Lieutenant Porfírio stood up. Vilela, who was some distance away, cupped one hand behind his right ear, while Calisto, fixing his eyes firmly on the tablecloth, appeared to be counting every thread. José Lemos alerted his wife, who, at that moment, was trying to tempt the implacable Antonico with a sweet chestnut; all other eyes were on the speaker.",CO047CL10
4562,151,"“Ladies! Gentlemen!” said Porfírio. “I do not intend to rummage around in the very heart of history, that teacher of life, to find out what marriage was like in the earliest ages of humankind. We all know, ladies and gentlemen, what marriage is. Marriage is the rose, the queen of the garden, unfurling its red petals in order to protect us from the thistles and thorns and barbs of life . . .”",CO047CL10
4563,152,“Bravo!”,CO047CL10
4564,153,“Delightful!”,CO047CL10
4565,154,"“If marriage is what I have just revealed to your auricular senses, there is no need to explain the joy, the fervor, the loving impulse, the explosions of sentiment felt by all of us seated here around this altar to celebrate our dear and much-loved friend.”",CO047CL10
4566,155,"José Lemos bowed his head so low that the tip of his nose touched a pear that lay in front of him on the table, and Dona Beatriz turned to Dr. Valença, who was sitting beside her, and said:",CO047CL10
4567,156,“Doesn’t he speak well! He’s like a walking dictionary!”,CO047CL10
4568,157,Porfírio went on:,CO047CL10
4569,158,"“I fear, ladies and gentlemen, that I lack the necessary talent to speak on the subject . . .”",CO047CL10
4570,159,“Nonsense! You speak really well!” cried many of the people surrounding him.,CO047CL10
4571,160,"“You are far too kind, but I still do not feel I have the necessary talent to grapple with a subject of such magnitude.”",CO047CL10
4572,161,“Nonsense!”,CO047CL10
4573,162,"“Please, you’re too kind,” said Porfírio, bowing. “While, as I say, I may lack that particular talent, I have more than enough goodwill, the same goodwill that led the Apostles to plant the religion of Calvary in the world, and thanks to that same feeling, I can sum up in just a few words my toast to the happy couple.",CO047CL10
4574,163,"Ladies and gentlemen, two flowers were born in two different flower beds, both of them beautiful, both highly scented, both full of divine life. They were born for each other; they were the carnation and the rose; the rose lived only for the carnation, the carnation lived only for the rose: along came a breeze and mingled the perfumes of the two flowers, and they, knowing they were in love, ran to meet each other. The breeze was godfather to that union. The rose and the carnation are united in the embrace of love, and sitting over there is the breeze honoring our gathering here tonight.”",CO047CL10
4575,164,No one was expecting this breeze; the breeze was Dr. Valença.,CO047CL10
4576,165,Loud applause greeted this speech combining Calvary with the carnation and the rose. Porfírio sat down with a sense of having done his duty. Supper was coming to an end; it was half-past eight; a few musicians were arriving in readiness for the ball. Still to come was a poem by Eduardo Valadares and a few more toasts to all those present and to those few who were absent.,CO047CL10
4577,166,"Now, with the liqueurs coming to the aid of the muses, battle was engaged between Lieutenant Porfírio and Justiniano Vilela, although the latter had to be urged to enter the arena. Once all subjects for debate had been exhausted, Porfírio proposed a toast to the army and its generals, and Vilela a toast to the union of all the provinces of the empire. When everyone else got up from the table, the two of them remained behind, warmly toasting all the practical and useful ideas of this world and the next.",CO047CL10
4578,167,The ball that followed was a very lively affair that went on until three in the morning.,CO047CL10
4579,168,"No untoward incident marred the party. At most, there was a rather regrettable remark made by José Lemos when dancing with Dona Margarida, during which he boldly lamented her fate at having a husband who preferred proposing endless toasts to enjoying the priceless good fortune of being by her side. Dona Margarida smiled, and the incident went no further.",CO047CL10
4580,169,"At two o’clock, Dr. Valença left with his family, and, despite the generally familiar tone of the party, he had not lost one iota of his habitual gravity all evening. Calisto Valadares escaped when Dona Beatriz’s younger daughter got up to sing at the piano, and the other guests gradually drifted away.",CO047CL10
4581,170,"When the party finally drew to a close, the last two tribal leaders of the dining table were still toasting all and sundry. Vilela’s final toast was to the world’s progress via coffee and cotton, while Porfírio raised his glass to universal peace.",CO047CL10
4582,171,"However, the real toast of that memorable feast was the little baby born in January of the following year, who, if he survives his teething pains, will live to continue the Lemos dynasty.",CO047CL10

4584,2,"AT THE TIME, Luís Tinoco was twenty-one. He was of medium height, bright-eyed, tousle-haired, inexhaustibly loquacious, impetuous, and passionate. He held a modest position at the law courts, where he earned a meager crust, and he lived with his godfather, whose sole income was his pension. Tinoco held old Anastácio in the highest esteem, and Anastácio was equally fond of his godson.",CO031CL10
4585,3,"Luís Tinoco was convinced he was destined for great things, and, for a long time, this proved to be his biggest obstacle in life. When Dr. Lemos first met Luís, the poetic flame was already beginning to burn in him, although no one knows quite how the fire was lit. Naturally, the thought of other men’s laurels began to keep him awake at night. Then, one morning, Luís Tinoco woke to find himself a fully fledged writer and poet; inspiration, which had been only the tightest of buds the night before, had blossomed into a lush, flamboyant flower. Luís hurled himself upon the blank page with ardor and determination, and between the hours of six and nine, before he was called down for breakfast, he produced a sonnet, whose main defects were that it was only five lines long and didn’t scan. Tinoco took his creation to the Correio Mercantil, which published it in the announcements section.",CO031CL10
4586,4,"The night before publication, the little sleep he had was interspersed with dreams from which he kept waking in a panic. Dawn finally came, and Luís Tinoco, not normally an early riser, rose with the sun and went off to read his sonnet in print. No mother ever contemplated her newborn child more lovingly than that young man, who read and reread his poem, which in any case he knew by heart. He imagined that all the other readers of the Correio Mercantil would be doing the same thing, and that every one of them would be admiring this new literary star and asking to whom that hitherto unknown name could possibly belong.",CO031CL10
4587,5,"He did not rest on those imaginary laurels. Two days later, he produced another poem, this time a sentimental ode in which he complained to the moon about his scornful mistress, already foreseeing for himself a death as melancholy as that of the poet Nicolas Gilbert. He could not afford the further expense involved in having this new poem printed, but a friend managed to get it into the paper for free, which meant delaying publication for a few days. Luís Tinoco found the waiting hard to bear, and even suspected some envious editors at the Correio Mercantil of dragging their feet.",CO031CL10
4588,6,"At last, the poem was published, and the poet was so pleased that he immediately went to reveal all to his godfather.",CO031CL10
4589,7,“Have you read today’s Correio Mercantil?” he asked.,CO031CL10
4590,8,"“You know perfectly well that I used to read newspapers when I was working, but I never read them now that I’m retired.”",CO031CL10
4591,9,"“Oh, that’s a shame!” said Luís coolly. “I was hoping you would tell me what you thought of a poem they’ve published.”",CO031CL10
4592,10,"“A poem! Don’t newspapers write about politics anymore? In my day, they talked of little else.”",CO031CL10
4593,11,"“They write about politics and they publish poems, because there’s room enough for both. Would you like to read it?”",CO031CL10
4594,12,"“All right, give it here.”",CO031CL10
4595,13,"And Luís duly produced a copy of the Correio Mercantil from his pocket, and old Anastácio began to read his godson’s work. With his eyes fixed on his godfather, Luís appeared to be trying to guess the impression made on him by his lofty thoughts, which he had put into verse taking all possible and impossible liberties with rhyme. Anastácio finished reading and pulled a face.",CO031CL10
4596,14,"“Dreadful stuff!” he said to his horrified godson. “What the devil has the moon got to do with that young woman’s indifference, and why drag in some poor foreigner’s miserable death?”",CO031CL10
4597,15,"Luís Tinoco felt like giving his godfather a good telling-off, but, instead, he merely smoothed back his hair and said with supreme disdain:",CO031CL10
4598,16,"“Not everyone can understand poetry, of course, and that ‘dreadful stuff’ is mine.”",CO031CL10

4605,23,"Anastácio reread the poem, and only then did he notice his godson’s name. There was no doubt about it: the boy had become a poet. To the retired old gentleman this spelled disaster, for the word “poet” was indissolubly linked in his mind with the word “poverty.”",CO031CL10
4606,24,"He imagined Camões and Bocage, the only literary names he knew, to have been two street performers, regurgitating sonnets in exchange for a few coins, sleeping in churchyards, and eating in the coach houses of large mansions. When he discovered that his own dear Luís had been infected with this terrible malaise, Anastácio felt very sad, and it was then that he went to see Dr. Lemos to tell him of his godson’s fearful plight.",CO031CL10

4608,26,“Really?” asked Dr. Lemos. “Is he any good?”,CO031CL10
4609,27,"“I don’t care if he’s good or bad. All I know is that it’s the worst thing that could possibly have befallen him, because poetry gets you nowhere. I’m afraid he’ll leave his job and end up on street corners babbling about the moon and surrounded by ne’er-do-wells.”",CO031CL10
4610,28,"Dr. Lemos reassured him, saying that poets were not the vagabonds he imagined; he told him that poetry was no obstacle to leading an ordinary life, to becoming a deputy, a minister, or a diplomat.",CO031CL10
4611,29,"“Nevertheless,” said Dr. Lemos, “I’ll speak to Luís and read what he’s written. I was a bit of versifier myself once and I’ll soon be able to judge if he’s any good or not.”",CO031CL10
4612,30,"Luís Tinoco went to see the doctor and took with him the sonnet and the ode as well as other as yet unpublished pieces, which tended to be either odes or sonnets, full of hackneyed images and trite expressions—in short, little inspiration and even less art. And yet, despite this, there was the occasional glimmer indicating that the neophyte might actually have some talent, and could, in time, become an excellent drawing-room troubador.",CO031CL10
4613,31,"Dr. Lemos told him frankly that poetry was a very difficult art and required long study, but that, if, despite all, he was determined to cultivate that art, then he should listen to some very necessary advice.",CO031CL10
4614,32,"“Of course,” said Luís, “feel free, make any suggestions that might be useful. I wrote these poems so quickly, I had no time to correct them.”",CO031CL10
4615,33,"“I really don’t think they’re very good,” said Dr. Lemos. “It would be best simply to tear them up and spend some time studying.”",CO031CL10
4616,34,"It would be impossible to describe the proud, disdainful gesture with which Luís Tinoco snatched the poems from the doctor’s hand and said:",CO031CL10
4617,35,"“Your advice is about as valuable as my godfather’s. As I told him, the ability to write poetry isn’t something you learn, it’s something you’re born with. I pay no heed to the envious. If the poems really were no good, the Correio Mercantil would never have published them.”",CO031CL10

The newspapers were full of his creations, some sad, some jolly, but the sadness and jollity were not of the sort that come straight from the heart; the sadness made one smile and the jollity made one yawn.",CO031CL10
4621,39,"Luís Tinoco confessed artlessly to the world that he was imbued with a Byronic skepticism, that he had drained the cup of sorrows to its dregs, that, as far as he was concerned, life had written Dante’s famous inscription above his door. And he quoted the words exactly, even though he had never read Dante. He bespattered his borrowed ideas with a selection of allusions and literary names, which was the full extent of his erudition, and felt no need, for example, to have read Shakespeare in order to quote “to be or not to be,” or mention Juliet’s balcony or Othello’s torment. He also had some very unusual ideas about the biographies of the famous.",CO031CL10

Dr. Lemos wanted to get away, but Tinoco would not let him, even grabbing his arm to keep him there. When Luís Tinoco threatened to read the poem out loud in the street, the doctor invited him, instead, to come and dine with him.",CO031CL10

My talent has been the target of all kinds of attacks, but I was prepared for that. It doesn’t frighten me. Camões’s sad death upon a wretched truckle bed is both an example and a consolation. Prometheus chained to the Caucasus is the very symbol of genius. Posterity is the revenge of those who are scorned in their own lifetime.”",CO031CL10

4651,69,"Over dessert—by which time there were only about five other customers left in the room—Luís Tinoco unfolded the dreaded sheet of paper and read the promised verses in a ridiculously affected, singsong voice. The poem spoke of everything, death and life, flowers and worms, love and hate; there were more than eight “cypresses,” nearly twenty “tears” and more “tombs” than a cemetery.",CO031CL10
4652,70,"The remaining five diners turned to look when Luís Tinoco began to recite, then began to smile and murmur inaudible comments. When the poet finished, one of their neighbors—a rather crude fellow—let out a loud guffaw. Luís Tinoco spun around, furious, but Dr. Lemos restrained him, saying:",CO031CL10
4653,71,“He wasn’t laughing at us.”,CO031CL10

4658,76,"Luís walked with him back to his house. On the way, he recited some verses he knew by heart. When he surrendered himself to the sound of his own poetry—not someone else’s, about which he cared very little—it was as if everything else were erased from his memory; self-contemplation sufficed. Dr. Lemos listened in the resigned silence of one who has to put up with the rain, which he can do nothing to stop.",CO031CL10

He concluded by giving his blessing to the book and calling attention to the list of subscribers at the back.",CO031CL10

4662,80,"After that, Dr. Lemos lost sight of his poet for some time, or, rather, he lost sight of the man but not his work, because Luís Tinoco’s poems would sporadically appear in some literary journal or other, which Dr. Lemos would inevitably read only to be astonished by Luís Tinoco’s sterile, dogged persistence. There was no occasion, no funeral, no solemn event, that escaped the inspiration of that fecund writer.",CO031CL10
4663,81,"Since his ideas were very few in number, it could be said that he had only ever written a eulogy, an elegy, an ode, and an encomium. The various examples of each type were merely the same thing said in a slightly different way. In that different way, however, lay the poet’s originality, an originality he did not possess to begin with, but which developed greatly over time.",CO031CL10
4664,82,"Unfortunately, in throwing himself ardently into these literary labors, he forgot all about his legal labors, which provided him with his daily bread. One day, Anastácio spoke of this misfortune to Dr. Lemos, in a letter that concluded thus: “My friend, I really do not know where the boy will end up. I can see only two possibilities: the insane asylum or prison.”",CO031CL10

Dr. Lemos concluded his speech by offering to find him a position as a clerk in a lawyer’s office. Luís Tinoco looked at him for a while without saying a word. Then, in the most melancholy, resigned tone imaginable, he said:",CO031CL10

To what extent did this love actually exist, and how far was his love reciprocated by her? History provides little information in this regard. What we do know is that, one day, a rival appeared on the horizon, and he was about as much of a poet as Luís Tinoco’s godfather, and, therefore, far better marriage material than the editor of The Literary Arbor; with one blow, he destroyed all the poet’s hopes.",CO031CL10

This work took as its epigraph Dante’s words: Nessun maggior dolore. When it was finished and corrected, he read it out loud to himself, pacing up and down in his bedroom, putting a final touch to one or two lines, admiring the harmony of many others, and wholeheartedly confessing to himself that it was his best work yet. The Literary Arbor still existed then, and Luís Tinoco rushed his poem to the press, having first shared it with his collaborators, who were all of the same opinion as him. Despite what must have been his all-consuming grief, the poet read the proofs carefully and scrupulously, was present when the first copies were printed, and, for many days afterward, he read and reread those lines, barely giving a thought to the betrayal that had inspired them.",CO031CL10
4719,137,"This, however, was not the reason for Luís Tinoco’s literary slumbers. That was purely political. The lawyer for whom he worked had been a deputy and contributed to a political gazette. His office was a meeting place for a lot of men in public life, who met there for long conversations about political parties and the government. At first Luís Tinoco listened to these conversations with the indifference of a god wrapped in the cloak of his immortality. Gradually, though, he began to acquire a taste for what he heard. He started reading parliamentary speeches and opinion pieces. This initial interest quickly became enthusiasm, because in Luís Tinoco everything was extreme—be it enthusiasm or indifference. One day, he woke with the conviction that he was destined to be a politician.",CO031CL10

4729,147,"Dr. Lemos granted Luís Tinoco’s wish. He went to see the lawyer and recommended the clerk to him, with little zeal, it’s true, but not coldly, either.

The lawyer thought it not without its defects, and pointed out certain excesses and imprecisions, the weakness of certain arguments, more ornament than substance, but promised to publish it anyway. Whether it was because he made these remarks tactfully and gently, or because Luís Tinoco had lost some of his former prickliness, or because the promise of having the article published sweetened the bitter taste of criticism, or for all those reasons put together, the fact is that he listened to his protector’s words with exemplary modesty and joy.",CO031CL10

4733,151,"The article was published, and Luís Tinoco received a few congratulatory handshakes. He again experienced the sweet, ineffable joy he had felt when his first poems were published in the Correio Mercantil, but it was a more complex joy, tempered by a virtuous decision: from that day forth, Luís Tinoco genuinely believed he had a mission, that nature and destiny had sent him into the world to right political wrongs.",CO031CL10

Moses led the Hebrews into the Promised Land, but was not fortunate enough to enter it himself: that is the symbol of the writer who carries men toward moral and political regeneration, without actually passing through the golden gates himself. What is there to fear? Prometheus chained to the Caucasus, Socrates drinking hemlock, Christ dying on the cross, Savonarola on the rack, John Brown hanging from the scaffold, they are all the great apostles of light, an example and comfort to those who love the truth and work to gain the penitence of tyrants and the thunderous overthrow of despotism.",CO031CL10
4736,154,"Luís Tinoco did not stop after that first success. The same fecundity that had marked his literary phase was repeated in this his political phase; his protector, meanwhile, told him that he should write less, and less flamboyantly too. The ex-poet accepted this criticism and even learned from it, producing a few articles rather less unkempt in style and content. Since Luís Tinoco knew nothing about politics, his protector lent a few books to a grateful Luís.",CO031CL10
4737,155,"However, readers of this story will have gathered by now that the author of Gillyflowers and Camellias was not a man to ponder long and hard over a page of writing; he was drawn to high-flown phrases—especially high-sounding ones—and would linger over them, repeat and consider them with genuine delight. He found reflection, observation, and analysis arid, and often avoided them entirely.",CO031CL10
4738,156,"Some time later, a primary election was called. Luís Tinoco felt that he had it in him to be a candidate, and said as much to the lawyer in no uncertain terms. His wish was received quite positively, and things were so arranged that he enjoyed the pleasure of seeing his name on an electoral slate and the surprise of being beaten. The government might beat him, but not defeat him. The ex-poet, still hot from battle, translated into long, flowery sentences the scorn he felt for his adversaries’ victory. Friends of the government responded with another article, which ended thus: “What does ex-deputy Z.’s little squirt of an assistant hope to achieve with such immoderate language?”",CO031CL10
4739,157,"Luís Tinoco almost died of pleasure to be the butt of that ministerial charge. The opposition press had not, until then, treated him with the consideration he wanted. They had, once or twice, discussed arguments he had put forward, but what was lacking was a personal attack, which seemed to him a necessary baptism of fire in that kind of campaign. When the lawyer read this attack, he told the ex-poet that his position was identical to that of William Pitt the Elder, when, in the House of Commons, the minister Robert Walpole had referred to Pitt as a mere boy, and he urged him to respond to that ministerial insult in the same tone.",CO031CL10
4740,158,"At the time, Luís Tinoco had no idea who Pitt and Walpole were, and yet, intrigued by the comparison, he cleverly and cautiously asked the lawyer if he could lend him the British orator’s speech so that he could “refresh his memory.” The lawyer did not have a copy to hand, but he summarized it thoroughly enough for Luís Tinoco to write a long article describing precisely what a little squirt was and was not.",CO031CL10
4741,159,"Meanwhile, the electoral fight had revealed to him a new talent. Since it was sometimes necessary to speechify, the little squirt did so with great personal pleasure and to general applause. Luís Tinoco asked himself if he should aspire to becoming an orator and answered in the affirmative. This new ambition was more difficult to achieve, as the ex-poet recognized, and so, arming himself with patience, he waited.",CO031CL10
4742,160,"There is here a lacuna in Luís Tinoco’s life. For reasons history does not record, two years after these electoral events our young man was dispatched to the native province of his friend and protector. Let us waste no time in speculating on the reasons for this journey, nor on the reasons that kept him there for longer than he wanted. Let us, instead, go and find him there a few months later, collaborating on a newspaper with the same youthful ardor he had shown while in Rio. With letters of recommendation from the lawyer to political friends and relatives, he soon built up a social circle, and settled into the idea that he would stay there for a while. His godfather had died, and Luís Tinoco was left with no family at all.",CO031CL10
4743,161,"His oratorical ambitions were not assuaged by the pleasures of being a writer; on the contrary, one encouraged the other. The idea of having two weapons and of brandishing them at the same time, and using both to threaten and defeat his adversaries, became a persistent, ever-present, inextinguishable idea. This was not vanity, that is, not childish vanity. Luís Tinoco piously believed that he was part of Providence’s plan, and this sustained and satisfied him.",CO031CL10
4744,162,"He had lacked all sincerity when he set down his misfortunes in verses to be read out to his friends, but he acquired real sincerity as he became more and more engrossed in politics. If someone doubted his political qualifications, this would wound him just as deeply as it had when people questioned his literary talent, but it did not wound his pride alone, but, more importantly, his deep and unbending belief that his talent was a necessary part of the universal harmony.",CO031CL10
4745,163,"Dr. Lemos was still living in Rio, and Luís Tinoco sent him all his provincial writings, and naïvely told him of his new hopes. One day, he informed him that his election to the provincial assembly was currently under negotiation and that those negotiations looked hopeful. The next letter brought the news that his candidature had become a fact.",CO031CL10
4746,164,"The election took place, and, after much effort and hard work, our candidate had the honor of being included on the list of winners. When he was told that victory was his, his soul sang a solemn, heartfelt “Te Deum Laudamos.” A sigh, the most deeply felt and deep-seated sigh ever uttered by man, consoled his heart for all the doubts and uncertainties of several long, cruel weeks. He had at last been elected! He was about to take his first step to glory.",CO031CL10
4747,165,"He slept badly that night, as he had on the eve of the publication of his first sonnet, and, again, his sleep was interspersed with dreams appropriate to the new situation. Luís Tinoco could already imagine himself thundering out a speech at the provincial assembly amid applause from some and curses from others and the envy of nearly everyone, and afterward reading in the local press warm praise for his fresh and utterly original eloquence. He drafted twenty different introductions to his maiden speech, whose subject would, of course, be worthy of grand flourishes and exalted passages. He was already mentally rehearsing gestures and poses and generally considering the figure he would cut in the provincial Chamber of Deputies.",CO031CL10
4748,166,"Many big names in politics had begun in the provincial parliament. If he was to fulfill Fate’s urgent mandate, then it was likely, even necessary, that he should leave there as soon as possible in order to pass through the wider door of national politics. In his mind, he was already occupying one of the seats in the congress building, and he immersed himself in thoughts of his own person and the brilliant role he would play.",CO031CL10
4749,167,"He could already see before him the opposition or the minister standing stunned by the five or six verbal blows Luís Tinoco believed he could deliver better than anyone; he could hear the newspapers talking and people asking about him, and his name reverberating throughout the Empire, and could see the ministerial portfolio landing in his lap, along with the post of minister itself.",CO031CL10
4750,168,"The new deputy imagined all this and much more as he lay in bed, his head on the pillow, with his mind setting off about the world, which is the worst thing that can happen to a body as tormented as was his at the time.",CO031CL10
4751,169,"Luís Tinoco immediately wrote to Dr. Lemos to tell him of his hopes and plans, now that Fortune was opening up before him the broad path of public life. The letter lingered on the probable effect of his first speech, and ended thus:",CO031CL10
4752,170,"Whatever position I may rise to, even the highest position in the land, immediately below that of Emperor (and I genuinely think I will go that far), I will never forget the debt I owe to you, sir, for your encouragement and your support. I believe that, up until now, I have not betrayed the confidence of my friends, and I hope I continue to deserve it.",CO031CL10
4753,171,"Finally, work began. Luís Tinoco was so anxious to speak at the very first session that he gave a two-hour speech about a plan to install a fountain and proved categorically that water was necessary to mankind. His first great battle took place in the debate about the provincial budget.",CO031CL10
4754,172,"Luís Tinoco gave a long speech in which he took on the governor-general, the president, his opponents, the police, and despotism. The gestures he made had never been seen in the entire history of parliamentary gesticulations; no one, at least no one in the province, had ever had the pleasure of seeing the way he had of shaking his head, bending his arm, pointing, raising, and bringing down his right hand.",CO031CL10
4755,173,"His style was unusual too. Never had anyone spoken of revenues and expenditures using such lush imagery and figures of speech. He compared revenues to the dew that collects on the flowers at night, and expenditures to the morning breeze that shakes the flowers and upsets a little of that revivifying moisture. A good government, he said, is that gentle breeze, while the current prime minister was declared to be nothing but hot air. The majority protested gravely at such an insulting description, however poetic. One of the ministers admitted that he had never known a chillier wind to blow in from Rio de Janeiro.",CO031CL10
4756,174,"Unfortunately, his opponents did not rest either. As soon as Luís Tinoco had finished his speech amid scattered applause from his friends, one of his adversaries took the floor and for a long time stood with eyes fixed on the novice speaker. Then, taking from his pocket a bundle of newspapers and a magazine, he cleared his throat and said:",CO031CL10
4757,175,“Rio de Janeiro sent us the honorable deputy who has just spoken. We were told he was a glittering star destined to impress and surpass our provincial talents. I immediately set about obtaining some of the honorable deputy’s earlier works.,CO031CL10

4765,183,"And so on and so on. A minority of deputies protested, Luís Tinoco turned white, then red, then white again, and the session ended in raucous laughter. The following day, the newspapers that supported Luís Tinoco thanked his adversary for the triumph he had handed to him by showing the province “an earlier, brilliant aspect of the illustrious deputy’s talent.” Those who had so indecorously laughed at the poem were condemned thus: “A few days ago, a deputy on the government’s side described his party as a caravan of good, honest men. He was right about the caravan; yesterday, we saw the camels.”",CO031CL10
4766,184,"Not even this could console Luís Tinoco. His letters to Dr. Lemos grew less frequent, and finally stopped altogether. Three years slipped silently by, at the end of which Dr. Lemos was nominated for some post or other in that same province. As soon as he had settled into his new post, he set about looking for the ex-poet, which took him no time at all, for he immediately received an invitation from Luís Tinoco to visit the country retreat where he was now living.",CO031CL10
4767,185,"“You’ll call me an ungrateful wretch, I’m sure,” said Luís Tinoco, as soon as Dr. Lemos arrived. “But I am not; I was hoping to see you in a year or so, and the reason I didn’t write was . . . But, Doctor, what’s wrong? You look shocked.”",CO031CL10
4768,186,"Dr. Lemos was indeed taken aback to see this new Luís Tinoco. Was this the author of Gillyflowers and Camellias, the eloquent deputy, the fiery orator? What he saw before him was an ordinary, honest laborer, with simple, rustic manners, and not a trace of the poet’s melancholy poses or the orator’s dramatic gestures—he had been completely transformed into a very different and far better creature.",CO031CL10
4769,187,"They both laughed, the doctor at the great change that had taken place, the ex-poet at the doctor’s amazement, and Dr. Lemos asked if Luís Tinoco really had abandoned politics or if he was merely taking a refreshing break from that world.",CO031CL10

It didn’t have the slightest trace of woman, young or old, of little songbirds, of flowers, of lively or happy hearts. A dark and bare house. The most cheerful thing was a harpsichord, which Maestro Romão, practicing, sometimes played. On a chair, at his feet, a few bits of sheet music, none of it his. . . .",CO118CL08
4792,11,"Ah! If it had been up to Maestro Romão he would have been a great composer. There are apparently two sorts of calling, those that can express themselves and those that cannot.

He had a calling for music; he had a lot of operas and masses inside of him, a world of new and original harmonies he couldn’t manage to express and put on paper. This was the sole cause of Maestro Romão’s sadness. Naturally, the common people didn’t guess right. Some said one thing, others another: illness, lack of money, some old heartbreak. But the truth is this: the cause of Maestro Romão’s melancholy was his inability to compose, to come into possession of the means to translate what he felt.",CO118CL08

Like a bird that has just been caught and strains to get through the walls of its cage, bottom, top, impatient, frightened, that is how inspiration hit our musician, caged inside him without being able to get out, finding no door, nothing.",CO118CL07
4834,16,"Some notes managed to connect themselves; he wrote them down; a work of one sheet of paper, no more. He persisted on the following day, ten days later, twenty times during his marriage.

The neighborhood, just finding out about the discomfort, wanted for no other topic of conversation; those who maintained a relationship with the maestro went to visit him. And they told him it was nothing, just a seasonal cold; another graciously added that it was whining, in order to get out of the losses the pharmacist gave him at backgammon; another that it was love.

As soon as he was alone, with the slave, he opened the drawer where since 1779 he had kept the nuptial song that he had started. He reread the notes that had been yanked out at such cost and never concluded.

To complete the illusion, he directed his eyes out the window towards the newly married couple.",CO118CL07

He was known familiarly as Maestro Romão, and, in those days, “familiarly” and “publicly” amounted to much the same thing. “Maestro Romão is conducting the mass” was the equivalent of that other form of announcement many years later:",CO118CL10

See him coming down from the choir, leaning on his stick; he’s going to the sacristy to kiss the priests’ hands and accept their invitation to join them for lunch. All without saying a word, entirely indifferent. He has lunch, leaves the church, and walks toward the Rua da Mãe dos Homens, where he lives with an old black slave called Papa José, who is his true mother and who, at this very moment, is talking to the woman next door.",CO118CL10

It bore not a trace of a woman’s presence, either old or young; there were no songbirds, no flowers, no lively, cheerful colors. It was a somber, barren place. The most joyful thing was the harpsichord, which Maestro Romão sometimes played when practicing. On a chair beside it lay some sheets of music, none composed by him.",CO118CL10
4866,11,"Ah! If Maestro Romão had had the necessary talent, he would have been a great composer! It seems there are two sorts of vocation: those that can speak and those that cannot. The former find fulfillment; the latter are nothing but a continual, sterile struggle between one’s internal impulse and one’s inability to communicate with the outside world.",CO118CL10
4867,12,"Romão’s vocation belonged in that second category. He had a profound vocation for music; he carried within him many operas and masses, a whole world of new and original harmonies that he could neither express nor put down on paper. This was the sole cause of Maestro Romão’s sadness. Naturally, the hoi polloi did not realize this; some said one thing, others said another: illness, a lack of money, some lingering regret, but the truth is this: the cause of Maestro Romão’s melancholy was that inability to compose and translate his feelings into music.",CO118CL10
4868,13,"Not that he hadn’t scribbled many a bar and stave and sat staring at the harpsichord for hours on end, but everything emerged unformed and shapeless, with neither idea nor harmony. Latterly, he had even begun to feel embarrassed lest his neighbors should hear him, and so he had stopped trying altogether.",CO118CL10
4869,14,"And yet, if he could, he wanted at least to finish one particular piece, a nuptial song started three days after he got married in 1779. His wife, who was then twenty-one and who had died at age twenty-three, was not pretty in the least, but she was extremely kind and loved him as much as he loved her. Three days after their wedding, Maestro Romão felt the stirrings of something akin to inspiration.",CO118CL10
4870,15,"He conceived the idea of writing a nuptial song and set about composing it, but the inspiration remained locked inside. Like a bird that has just been captured and tries to escape through the bars of the cage, flitting up and down, impatient and terrified—that was our musician’s inspiration, imprisoned within him, unable to escape, unable to find a door or a way out.",CO118CL10
4871,16,"A few notes managed to come together; he wrote them down, just a single sheet of paper, nothing more. He tried again the following day, then ten days later, and at least twenty times more during their marriage.

When they heard about the illness, the neighbors could speak of nothing else; those who were on friendly terms with the maestro went to visit him, telling him it was nothing to worry about and that it was probably just a bug that was going around; someone added jokingly that it was simply a trick on his part to avoid being beaten at backgammon by the apothecary; someone else chipped in that he must be lovesick.

For everything else it was a permanent feature, and had been for five or six years, the length of his marriage.

Her insistence, at first muted and pleading, soon became sharp and demanding. Conrado was taken aback. He knew his wife; usually, she was a passive, sweet creature, pliable and made to measure – she could have worn a royal diadem or a nun’s habit with the same divine indifference.",CO120CL04
4910,18,"The proof of this is that, having had an active social life in the two years before she was married, no sooner did she marry than she settled into quiet habits. She went out from time to time, most often because her husband himself insisted; but she was only really comfortable at home. The furniture, curtains and ornaments took the place of children; she loved them like a mother, and so perfect was her harmony with her surroundings, that she savoured her knick-knacks in their usual place, the curtains pulled back in the usual fashion, and so on and so forth.",CO120CL04
4911,19,"One of the three windows that gave on to the street, for example, was always half open; always it was the same one.

4914,22,"A frock-coat was what he still wore to funerals, and not for the motives my reader might suspect, the solemnity of death or the gravity of the final farewell, but for this, less philosophical, reason – it was an old custom. It was the only explanation he gave, whether for frock-coats at funerals, for eating his main meal at two in the afternoon, or for twenty other old-fashioned ways. He was so attached to his habits that on his daughter’s wedding anniversary he went to their house at six in the evening with his meal eaten and digested, watched them eat, and at the end accepted a little dessert, a glass of wine and coffee.",CO120CL04

He put up with it in silence, out of respect for the qualities of the individual; nothing more. However, that day it happened that he saw it in the street out of the corner of his eye, chatting with other top hats on professional men, and it had never seemed so crass. That evening, finding his daughter alone, he opened his heart to her; he dubbed the low hat the height of abomination, and entreated her to have it permanently banished.",CO120CL04

Knowing how docile his wife was, he didn’t understand her resistance; and because he was authoritarian and stubborn, her insistence ended by irritating him profoundly. Even so he contained himself; he preferred to make fun of the matter; he spoke to her with such irony and disdain that the poor lady felt humiliated. Mariana twice tried to get up; he made her stay, the first time gripping her lightly by the wrist, the second subjugating her with a look. And he said, smiling:",CO120CL04

4919,27,"‘The choice of a hat is not an indifferent act, as you might suppose; it is governed by a metaphysical principle. Don’t imagine that a person buying a hat is committing a free, voluntary act; the truth is that he is obeying an obscure determinism. The illusion of freedom is rooted in the purchaser, and kept alive by hatters who, when they see a customer try on thirty or forty hats, imagine he is freely looking for an elegant combination.",CO120CL04
4920,28,"The metaphysical principle is the following – the hat completes the man, it is a complement decreed ab eterno; no one can change it without self-mutilation. This is a profound matter, one that has never yet occurred to anyone. Wise men have studied everything from stars to worms, or, to give you the bibliographical references, from Laplace onwards … You’ve never read Laplace?",CO120CL04
4921,29,"From Laplace and his Mécanique céleste to Darwin and his curious book about worms,3 yet they’ve never thought to stop and look at a hat, and study it from every angle.

Perhaps the hat isn’t the complement of man, but man of the hat …’",CO120CL04

She’d understood nothing of his grating vocabulary, nor his peculiar theory; but she felt the sarcasm, and, inside herself, she wept for shame. Her husband went up to dress; he came down a few minutes later, and stood in front of her with the famous hat on his head. Mariana thought it really did make him look coarse, commonplace, vulgar, not at all serious. Conrado said a ceremonious goodbye and left.",CO120CL04
4923,31,"The lady’s irritation had subsided a good deal; but the feeling of humiliation was still there. Mariana didn’t weep or scream, as she thought she was going to; but in her thoughts she remembered her simple request, Conrado’s sarcastic comments, and even though she recognised she had been a little demanding, she could find no excuse for such excesses. She paced up and down, unable to keep still; she went into the sitting room, approached the half-open window, and saw her husband again, in the street waiting for the tram, with his back to the house, and the eternal, disgusting, crass hat on his head.",CO120CL04
4924,32,"Mariana felt possessed by hatred of that ridiculous article; she didn’t understand how she’d been able to put up with it for so many years. And she thought back over those years, thought of her docile ways, her acquiescence to all her husband’s wishes and whims, and asked herself if that might not actually be the cause of that morning’s outburst.",CO120CL04
4925,33,"She called herself foolish, a pushover; if she’d been like so many others, Clara or Sophia, for instance, who treated their husbands as they should be treated, nothing remotely like this would have happened.

She greeted her friend in her usual enthusiastic manner; and even though Mariana said nothing, she guessed she was nursing a considerable grievance. Goodbye to Mariana’s intentions! Twenty minutes later, she was telling her all. Sophia laughed at her, shrugged her shoulders, and told her it wasn’t her husband’s fault.",CO120CL04

Look at that booby Beatriz; hasn’t she just gone into the country, only because her husband took against an English-man who used to go by their house in the afternoons, on horseback? Poor Englishman! Naturally, he didn’t even notice she’d gone. We women can live quite well with our husbands, with mutual respect, nobody treading on anyone else’s toes, with no fits of pique and no overbearing ways.",CO120CL04

I never ask him anything but he does it straight away; even when he’s not at all in the mood, all I have to do is frown, and he obeys in no time. He’d not be one to dig his heels in! What? Not likely! Where would that lead us! He’d change his hat whether he liked it or not.’",CO120CL04
4932,40,"Mariana listened enviously to this delightful definition of conjugal bliss. Eve’s rebellion was just putting the trumpet to her lips, ready for a fanfare; and being with her friend gave her an itch for independence and self-assertion. Just to round the situation off, Sophia was not only very much mistress of herself, but of others too; she had eyes for any Englishman, on horseback or on foot.",CO120CL04
4933,41,"She was virtuous, but a flirt; perhaps the word is a bit crude, and there’s no time to find another, more polite one. She flirted with anyone, left, right and centre, out of a natural need, a habit from before she was married. It was the small change of love, which she distributed to all the poor people who knocked at her door – a penny to one, another to another; never a five-pound note, much less a share certificate.",CO120CL04
4934,42,"This same charitable feeling now led her to propose to her friend that they should go out, see the shops and have a good look at some other handsome, dignified hats. Mariana accepted; some devil was stoking up the fires of vengeance inside her. Moreover, her friend, like Bonaparte, had the gift of seduction, and gave her no time to reflect. Yes, she would go, she was tired of living like a captive. She had the right to some fun too, etc., etc.",CO120CL04
4935,43,"While Sophia went to get dressed, Mariana stayed in the drawing room, restless and pleased with herself.

4937,45,"Once when she went to the window, she saw a young man pass by on horseback.

Mariana did note those two defects, but she thought his hat made up for them; not that it was a top hat: it was flat, but it fitted in with his riding gear. It wasn’t sitting on the head of a lawyer going gravely to his office, but on that of a man who was amusing himself or passing the time of day.",CO120CL04
4939,47,"Sophia’s heels came unhurriedly down the stairs. ‘Ready!’ she said a little later, as she came into the room. She was pretty, without a word of a lie. We already know she was tall. Her hat made her look more imperious; and a wicked black silk dress, moulding her breasts, made her look even more striking. Next to her, Mariana was somewhat in the shade. You had to look at her first to notice that she had very attractive features, a pair of very pretty eyes, and a great deal of natural elegance.",CO120CL04
4940,48,"The worst of it was that Sophia took over from the start; and if there was only a brief moment available, she took it all for herself. This comment would be incomplete, if I didn’t add that Sophia was aware of her superiority, and for this very reason appreciated beauties of Mariana’s type, less flamboyant and obvious. If this is a defect, it’s not my duty to correct it.",CO120CL04
4941,49,‘Where are we going?’ asked Mariana.,CO120CL04
4942,50,"‘Don’t be silly! For a trip into town … Now I remember, I’m going to have my photograph taken; then I’m going to the dentist. No; let’s go to the dentist first. You don’t have to go the dentist?’",CO120CL04
4943,51,‘No.’,CO120CL04
4944,52,‘Nor have your photograph taken?’,CO120CL04
4945,53,‘I’ve got lots already. And what for? To give it to “him”?’,CO120CL04
4946,54,"Sophia realised that her friend’s resentment was still there, and on the way, was careful to spice things up a bit. She told her that, difficult though it might be, there was still time to break free. And she showed her the method for escaping tyranny. The best thing was not to do it all at once, but slowly, surely, so that he would only come to when she already had her foot on his neck: a few weeks’ work, three or four, no more than that. Sophia herself was quite ready to help her. And she repeated that she mustn’t be too soft, she was no one’s slave, and so on. Mariana, in her heart, was intoning the Marseillaise of matrimony.",CO120CL04
4947,55,"They reached the Rua do Ouvidor. It was a little after midday. There were lots of people, walking or standing, the usual hustle and bustle. Mariana felt a little dizzy, as she always did. Uniformity and placidity, the basis of her character and life, got the usual knocks from all this agitation. She could hardly find her way between the groups of people, even less did she know where to fix her gaze, such was the confusion of the crowds, the variety of the shops. She kept close to her friend, and without noticing that they had already passed the dentist’s surgery, was anxious to get there. It would be a resting place; it was something better than this tumult.",CO120CL04
4948,56,"‘Oh, this street!’ she was saying.",CO120CL04
4949,57,"‘Uh-huh?’ Sophia replied, turning her head towards her and the eyes of a young man on the opposite pavement.",CO120CL04
4950,58,"Sophia, a frequent traveller on these turbulent seas, made her way through the crowd, passing round people skilfully and calmly. She had an imposing figure; those who knew her were pleased to see her again; those who didn’t, stopped or turned round to admire her panache. And the good lady, overflowing with charity, spread her eyes to right and left, causing no great scandal, for Mariana served to lend respectability to her movements. Her sentences were often curtailed; in fact, it seemed as if she hardly heard her friend’s replies; but she talked about everything, about other people coming and going, about a shop, a hat … And in fact, there were lots of hats – ladies’ and gentlemen’s hats – as people gathered on the Rua do Ouvidor.",CO120CL04
4951,59,"‘Look at this one,’ Sophia said to her.",CO120CL04
4952,60,"And Mariana obediently looked at them, feminine or masculine, without knowing where to put herself, for these accursed hats milled around as if in a kaleidoscope. Where is the dentist? she asked her friend. Only when she asked her a second time did Sophia reply that they’d already passed the surgery; but now they were going on to the end of the street; they’d come back later. Finally, they did so.",CO120CL04
4953,61,‘Oh!’ Mariana let out a sigh of relief as they entered the corridor.,CO120CL04
4954,62,"‘Good heavens, what’s this? Look at you! You’d think you’d just come in from the country.’",CO120CL04
4955,63,"There were some customers already in the dentist’s waiting room. Mariana saw not a single face she recognised, and so as not to be inspected by strangers, she went over to the window. From the window she could enjoy looking at the street, without being jostled. She leaned back; Sophia came over. Some male hats, standing in the street, began to look at them; others did the same as they passed by. Mariana was annoyed by their insistence; but when she saw that they were mostly looking at her friend, her boredom dissolved into a kind of envy.",CO120CL04
4956,64,"Sophia, meanwhile, was telling the stories attached to some of the hats – or their adventures, more accurately. One of them was seldom out of the thoughts of So-and-so, another was head over heels in love with Such-and-such, and she with him, so much so that they were always to be seen on the Rua do Ouvidor on Wednesdays and Saturdays between two and three in the afternoon. Mariana listened in amazement. It was a handsome hat, in fact, with a lovely tie, and had a look somewhere between elegance and roguishness, but …",CO120CL04
4957,65,"‘I can’t swear, mind,’ Sophia was saying, ‘but that’s what they say.’",CO120CL04
4958,66,"Mariana stared thoughtfully at the hat under inspection. Now there were three more, as elegant and charming, and the four were probably talking about them, and flatteringly too. Mariana blushed to her roots, turned her head away, then back again, and finally left the window. As she did so, she saw two ladies who’d just arrived, and with them a young man who got up and greeted her very ceremoniously. It was her first suitor.",CO120CL04
4959,67,"This first suitor would now be thirty-three. He’d been away, in the country, in Europe, and had lately had a spell as president of one of the southern provinces. He was of medium height, pale, with a thin, full beard, and wore very tight clothes. In his right hand he had a new top hat, black, grave, presidential, administrative, a hat suited to the person and his ambitions.",CO120CL04
4960,68,"Mariana, however, was almost blind to it. She was so confused, so disoriented by the presence of a man she’d known in somewhat exceptional circumstances, and hadn’t seen since 1877, that she couldn’t fix her eyes on anything. She held her fingers out; it seems she even murmured some kind of reply, and was just going back to the window, when her friend turned from the window towards her and came over.",CO120CL04
4961,69,"Sophia also knew the new arrival. They exchanged some words. Mariana asked her in an impatient whisper if it wouldn’t be better to put the teeth off for another day; but her friend said no; it was only a matter of half or three-quarters of an hour. Mariana felt oppressed: the presence of a man like this inhibited her, threw her into a state of conflict and confusion.",CO120CL04
4962,70,"It was all her husband’s fault. If he hadn’t been so stubborn, and made fun of her on top of that, nothing would have happened. As she thought this, Mariana swore she’d have her vengeance. In her memory she looked longingly at her house, so quiet, so pretty, where she might still have been, as usual, without the pushing and shoving in the street, without her dependence on her friend …",CO120CL04
4963,71,"‘Mariana,’ said Sophia, ‘Dr Viçoso insists he’s quite thin. Don’t you think he’s put on weight since last year? … Don’t you remember him last year?’",CO120CL04
4964,72,"Dr Viçoso was the ex-suitor; he was chatting with her, frequently casting his gaze in Mariana’s direction. She replied in the negative. He took advantage of this opportunity to pull her into the conversation, saying that, as a matter of fact, he hadn’t seen her for some years. And he underlined his words with a certain sad, profound look. Then he opened up his box of topics, and pulled out the opera. What did they think of the company?",CO120CL04
4965,73,"In his opinion it was excellent, except for the baritone; the baritone seemed to be suffering from fatigue. Sophia protested at the baritone’s fatigue, but he insisted, adding that, in London, where he’d heard him for the first time, he’d already struck him the same way. But the ladies were a different matter; the soprano and the contralto were of the first order. He talked about the operas, praised the orchestra, especially in Les Huguenots …4 He’d seen Mariana on the last night, in the fourth or fifth box on the left, wasn’t that right?",CO120CL04
4966,74,"‘Yes, we were there,’ she murmured, underlining the plural pronoun.",CO120CL04
4967,75,"‘I haven’t seen you at the Cassino though,’5 he went on.",CO120CL04
4968,76,"‘She’s turning into a recluse,’ said Sophia, laughing.",CO120CL04
4969,77,"Viçoso had enjoyed the last ball a great deal, and enumerated his reminiscences of it; Sophia did the same. The best toilettes were described by both in some detail; then came the people, their characters, with two or three malicious digs, so anodyne, however, as not to harm anyone. Mariana listened without interest; two or three times she even got up to go to the window; but the hats were so many, and they looked at her with such curiosity, that she went to sit down again. Just to herself, she called her friend nasty names; I won’t quote any of them here – it’s unnecessary, and moreover it would be in bad taste to reveal what one young lady thought about another during a few minutes’ irritation.",CO120CL04
4970,78,‘And the races at the Jockey Club?’ asked the ex-president.,CO120CL04
4971,79,"Mariana shook her head again. She hadn’t gone to the races this year at all. Well, she’d missed a great deal; the meeting before last, in particular; it was very lively, and the horses were of the first order. The horses at Epsom, which he’d seen when he was in England, were no better than those at the meeting before last at the Prado Fluminense. Sophia was in total agreement, the meeting before last was a feather in the Jockey Club’s cap.",CO120CL04
4972,80,"She confessed she’d enjoyed it a lot; it gave her quite a thrill. The conversation moved on to two concerts taking place that week; then it took the ferry, and went up the mountainside to Petrópolis, where two diplomats had put him up at their expense. When he mentioned a minister’s wife, it occurred to Sophia to be agreeable to the ex-president, declaring that he must marry too, for he would soon be a member of the cabinet.",CO120CL04
4973,81,"Viçoso squirmed with pleasure, smiled, and protested; then, with his eyes on Mariana, said that probably he would never marry … Mariana blushed deeply and got up.",CO120CL04
4974,82,"‘You’re in a hurry,’ said Sophia. ‘What time is it?’ she went on, turning to Viçoso.",CO120CL04
4975,83,‘Nearly three!’ he exclaimed.,CO120CL04
4976,84,"Time was getting on; he had to go to the Chamber of Deputies. He went over to speak to the two ladies whom he’d accompanied, cousins of his, and said goodbye to them; he was going to say goodbye to our friends as well, but Sophia said she too was leaving. She wasn’t waiting any longer. The truth is that the idea of going to the Chamber of Deputies had begun to set off sparks in her mind.",CO120CL04
4977,85,‘Shall we go to the Chamber?’ she proposed to her friend.,CO120CL04
4978,86,"‘No, no,’ said Mariana; ‘I can’t, I’m very tired.’",CO120CL04
4979,87,"‘Come on, just for a short while; I’m very tired too …’",CO120CL04
4980,88,"Mariana resisted for a little; but resisting Sophia – a dove arguing with a hawk – was a pointless occupation. There was no choice, and she went. The street was busier now; people were coming and going along both pavements, and getting in each others’ way at the street corners. What was more, the obliging ex-president walked between the two ladies, having offered to find them a seat to watch the proceedings.",CO120CL04
4981,89,"Mariana felt her soul increasingly torn apart by all this confusion. She had lost her original interest; and her vexation, which had provided the strength for her audacious, ephemeral flight, felt its wings weakening – or rather, she felt they had lost all their strength. And again she thought back to her house, so tranquil, with all her things each in their place, methodical, respectful of one another, everything happening unhurriedly, and, above all, with no unforeseen changes. And her soul began to tap its foot, angrily …",CO120CL04
4982,90,"She wasn’t listening to anything Viçoso was saying, even though he was talking in a loud voice, and many of his statements were addressed to her. She heard nothing, didn’t want to hear anything. She merely asked God to make the time go quickly. They got to the Chamber and went to a seat. The rustle of skirts drew the attention of some twenty deputies, who were still there, listening to a speech on the budget. As soon as Viçoso begged leave and left, Mariana quickly asked her friend not to play another one on her.",CO120CL04
4983,91,‘What other?’ Sophia asked.,CO120CL04
4984,92,"‘Don’t play another trick on me, having me rushing round from one place to another like a madwoman. What’s the Chamber got to do with me? Why should I listen to speeches I don’t understand?’",CO120CL04
4985,93,"Sophia smiled, fanned herself, and got an outright stare from one of the secretaries. There were many eyes fixed on her when she went into the Chamber, but this secretary’s had a special, warm, pleading expression. We can understand, then, that she didn’t acknowledge the stare straight away; we can even understand that she sought it out with some curiosity. As she was taking in this legislative gaze, she went on mildly answering her friend, telling her that it was her own fault, and that she, Sophia, had set out with the best of intentions, to restore her to herself.",CO120CL04
4986,94,"‘But if I’m getting on your nerves you needn’t come with me again,’ Sophia concluded.",CO120CL04
4987,95,"Then, leaning over a little:",CO120CL04
4988,96,‘Look at the justice minister.’,CO120CL04
4989,97,"Mariana had no alternative but to look at the justice minister. He was putting up as well as he could with a speech by a government supporter, who was proving the importance of the minor criminal courts, and, on the way, providing a summary of the colonial legislation on the matter. No interruptions: a resigned, polite, discreet and cautious silence. Mariana’s eyes wandered from one side to another, without interest; Sophia was talking a lot, so as to give occasion for various elegant gestures. After fifteen minutes the Chamber livened up, thanks to one of the orator’s expressions and a challenge from the opposition. There was some heckling, which became more and more heated, and then there was an uproar, which lasted nearly a quarter of an hour.",CO120CL04
4990,98,"This diversion provided no amusement to Mariana, whose placid, unvarying spirit was bewildered at so much unexpected agitation. She even got up to go, but sat down again. Now she made up her mind to go on to the end, repentant and resolved to weep over her conjugal sorrows on her own. Doubt was beginning to enter, even.",CO120CL04
4991,99,"She was right to ask her husband what she did; but should she have been so upset? Was it reasonable to make so much fuss? Certainly, his ironies were cruel; but, after all, it was the first time she’d stamped her foot, and naturally, the novelty had irritated him. Whichever way you looked at it, it had been a mistake to reveal everything to her friend. Sophia might well tell others…",CO120CL04
4992,100,"This notion made Mariana go cold; her friend was sure to be indiscreet; she’d heard a lot of stories from her about male and female hats, things rather more serious than just a marital tiff. Mariana felt the need to flatter her, and covered up her impatience and anger with a mask of hypocritical docility. She began to smile too, to make some observations about this or that deputy, and so they reached the end of the speech and the session.",CO120CL04
4993,101,"The clocks had already struck four. ‘Time to be off,’ said Sophia; and Mariana agreed, but without impatience, and both of them went back up the Rua do Ouvidor. Walking along the street and getting into the tram put the finishing touches to the exhaustion of Mariana’s spirit; she gave a sigh of relief when she saw she was finally on her way home. A little before her friend got off, she asked her to keep what had happened to herself; Sophia promised she would.",CO120CL04
4994,102,"Mariana breathed easily. The dove was free of the hawk. Her soul was bruised from pushing and shoving, dizzy from the variety of things and people. She needed harmony and well-being. The house was nearby; as she saw the other houses with their gardens, Mariana felt restored to her former self. Finally, she got home; she went into the garden, and breathed deeply. That was her world; apart from a flowerpot, which the gardener had moved.",CO120CL04
4995,103,"‘João, put that pot back where it was,’ she said.",CO120CL04
4996,104,"Everything else was in order, the hall, the drawing room, the dining room, the bedrooms, everything. Mariana sat down first, in a few different places, looking at all the objects, so still and ordered. After a whole day of variety and disturbance, monotony did her a great deal of good, and had never seemed so delicious to her. It was true, she’d made a mistake …",CO120CL04
4997,105,"She tried to go back over events and couldn’t; her soul was stretching its arms and yawning in this homely uniformity. If anything, she thought about the figure of Viçoso, whom she now thought ridiculous, which was unjust. She slowly undressed, lovingly, picking every object up with precision. Once this was done, she thought again about the quarrel with her husband. She thought, when all was said and done, that she was mainly to blame. Why on earth make such a fuss about a hat that her husband had worn for so many years? And her father was too demanding …",CO120CL04
4998,106,"‘I’ll wait and see his face when he comes back,’ she thought.",CO120CL04
4999,107,"It was half past five; he’d not be long. Mariana went to the front room, looked through the glass, listened for the tram – nothing. She sat down right there with Ivanhoe in her hands, trying to read, and reading nothing. Her eyes went to the bottom of the page, and back to the top, in the first place because she couldn’t grasp the meaning, and in the second place because they kept being diverted, to savour the correct drop of the curtains, or some other feature in the room. Holy Monotony, you cradled her in your eternal bosom.",CO120CL04
5000,108,"Finally, a tram stopped; her husband got off; the garden’s metal gate creaked. Mariana went to the window and peeped out. Conrado was coming slowly in, looking to right and left, with the hat on his head – not the famous hat he’d been used to wearing, but another, the one his wife had asked him to wear that morning. Mariana’s spirit received a violent shock, similar to the one she’d got from the changed flowerpot – or would have got from a sheet of Voltaire encountered among the pages of Moreninha or Ivanhoe …",CO120CL04
5001,109,"It was a discordant note in the middle of the harmonious sonata of life. No, that hat was impossible. Really, what kind of lunacy was this, demanding he stop wearing the other, which fitted him so well? And even if it wasn’t the most appropriate, he’d worn it for many years; it went with her husband’s face … Conrado came in by a side door. Mariana received him in her arms.",CO120CL04
5002,110,"‘Well, is it over?’ he asked, finally, holding her by the waist.",CO120CL04

5010,7,"SING, O MUSE, of the dismay of Mariana, wife of the distinguished Conrado Seabra, on that April morning in 1879. What could be the cause of such upset? A simple hat, light and not inelegant; in short, a bowler hat.",CO120CL12
5011,8,"Conrado, a lawyer with offices on Rua da Quitanda, wore it to the city every day, and it went with him to all his court hearings; he only refrained from wearing it at receptions, the opera, funerals, and formal social visits. Otherwise, it was a constant feature, and had been so for the entire five or six years of his marriage. Until, on that particular April morning, after finishing their breakfast, Conrado began to roll a cigarette, and Mariana announced with a smile that she had something to ask him.",CO120CL12
5012,9,"“What is it, my angel?”",CO120CL12
5013,10,“Would you be capable of making a sacrifice for me?”,CO120CL12
5014,11,“I could make ten or twenty of them!”,CO120CL12
5015,12,“Then stop wearing that hat to the city.”,CO120CL12
5016,13,“Why? Is it ugly?”,CO120CL12
5017,14,"“I wouldn’t say ugly, but it’s only meant to be worn locally, when going for a stroll around the neighborhood, in the evenings or at night. But in the city, for a lawyer, well, it hardly seems—”",CO120CL12
5018,15,"“Don’t be so silly, sweetie!”",CO120CL12
5019,16,"“It may be silly, but will you do it as a favor? Just for me?”",CO120CL12
5020,17,"Conrado struck a match, lit his cigarette, and tried to change the subject with an affable wave of his hand, but his wife persisted, and her insistence, at first gently imploring, quickly became harsh and imperious. Conrado was shocked. He knew his wife; she was usually such a passive creature, sweet and gently amenable as the situation demanded, capable of wearing a bonnet, a wimple, or a royal tiara with the same divine indifference.",CO120CL12
5021,18,"The proof of this is that, having been part of a rather fast set during the two years before marrying, once she did marry, she quickly settled into homelier habits. She did go out from time to time, mainly at the behest of her husband, but she was only truly at ease in her own home. Furniture, curtains, and ornaments made up for the lack of children; she loved them like a mother, and such was the harmony between person and surroundings that she took particular pleasure in everything being in its proper place, the curtains hanging in the same neat folds, and so on.",CO120CL12
5022,19,"For example, one of the three windows that gave onto the street was always left half open, and it was always the same one. Even her husband’s study did not escape her fastidious demands, for she carefully maintained, and at times restored, his books, so that they were always in the same state of disorder. Her mental habits were equally uniform.",CO120CL12
5023,20,"Mariana possessed very few ideas and read only the same books again and again: Macedo’s Moreninha, seven times; Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe and The Pirate, ten times each; Le Mot de l’Énigme by Madame Craven, eleven times.",CO120CL12
5024,21,"In the light of all this, how can one explain this business with the hat? The previous evening, while her husband was attending a meeting of the bar association, Mariana’s father came to their house. He was a kindly old man, wiry and somewhat ponderous, a retired civil servant who was consumed by nostalgia for the days when employees wore frock coats to the office.",CO120CL12
5025,22,"Even now, a frock coat was what he wore to funerals, not for the reasons a reader might suspect, such as the solemnity of death or the gravity of a final farewell, but for the less philosophical reason that this was how things used to be. He always gave the same reason, whether it was frock coats at funerals, or having dinner at two o’clock in the afternoon, or twenty other such foibles. He was so chained to his habits that, on his daughter’s wedding anniversary, he would go to their house at six o’clock, having already dined and digested, and watch them eat and, at the end, take a little dessert, a glass of port, and some coffee.",CO120CL12
5026,23,"Given that he was Conrado’s father-in-law, how could he possibly approve of his son-in-law’s bowler hat? He put up with it in silence, in consideration of the man’s other qualities, but nothing more. That day, however, he had caught sight of it in the street, conversing with other hats—top hats belonging to distinguished gentlemen—and never had it seemed so vile. That night, finding his daughter alone, he opened his heart to her, dubbing the bowler hat the “abomination of abominations,” and urging her to banish it.",CO120CL12
5027,24,"Conrado was unaware that this was the origin of the request. Knowing his wife’s docile nature, he did not understand her resistance, and, because he was willful and authoritarian, her stubbornness irritated him deeply. Even so, he kept these feelings to himself, preferring simply to scoff; he spoke to her with such scathing irony and disdain that the poor lady felt utterly humiliated. Twice Mariana tried to leave the table and twice he forced her to stay, the first time by grabbing her lightly by the wrist, the second time by subduing her with a withering look. And he said with a smile:",CO120CL12
5028,25,"“Now, then, sweetie, I have a philosophical reason for not doing as you ask. I have never told you this before, but I will now tell you everything.”",CO120CL12
5029,26,"Mariana bit her lip and said no more; she picked up a knife and began to tap it slowly on the table, just to have something to do, but her husband wouldn’t even allow her this; he delicately took the knife from her and went on:",CO120CL12
5030,27,"“Choosing a hat is no random act, as you might suppose; it is governed by a metaphysical principle. Do not think that a man who buys a hat does so freely and voluntarily; the truth is that he is obeying an obscure form of determinism. The illusion of liberty is deeply embedded in the purchaser’s psyche, and shared by hatters, who, after watching a customer try on thirty or forty hats, then leave without buying a single one, imagine that he is merely searching for the most elegant combination.",CO120CL12
5031,28,"The metaphysical principle is this: the hat completes the man; it is an extension of his head, a combination decreed ab eterno and that no man may put asunder without committing an act of mutilation. This is a profound question that no one has yet considered. Wise men have studied everything from asteroids to worms, or, in bibliographical terms, from Laplace—you mean you’ve never read Laplace?",CO120CL12
5032,29,"—well, from Laplace and his Mécanique Céleste to Darwin and his curious book about worms, and yet they’ve never thought to pause in front of a hat and study it from every angle. No one has noticed that there is a whole metaphysics of hats. Perhaps I should write an essay on the subject myself. However, it’s now a quarter to ten and I really must go, but do think about it and you’ll see what I mean. Who knows? Perhaps it’s not even the hat that complements the man, but the man who complements the hat.”",CO120CL12
5033,30,"Mariana finally wrested back her independence and got up from the table. She had not understood a word of his barbed terminology, nor his peculiar theory, but she sensed his sarcasm and, inside, she wept with humiliation. Her husband went upstairs to get dressed to go out, came back down a few minutes later, and stood in front of her with the infamous hat on his head. Mariana really did think it made him look seedy, vulgar, and not at all serious. Conrado ceremoniously bade her good day and left.",CO120CL12
5034,31,"The lady’s irritation had subsided considerably, but her feelings of humiliation remained. Mariana did not wail and weep, as she thought she would, but, thinking it all over, she recalled the simplicity of her request and Conrado’s sarcastic response, and, while she recognized that she had been somewhat demanding, she found no justification whatsoever for such excesses. She paced back and forth, unable to stand still; she went into the drawing room, approached the half-open window, and watched her husband standing in the street waiting for the streetcar, with his back to the house and that eternal, despicable hat on his head.",CO120CL12
5035,32,"Mariana felt herself overcome with hatred for that ridiculous item; she couldn’t understand how she had put up with it for so many years. And she thought of all those years of docility and acquiescence to her husband’s whims and desires, and wondered if that might not be the very thing that had led to his reaction that morning.",CO120CL12
5036,33,"She called herself a fool and a ninny; if she had behaved like so many other wives, Clara or Sofia, for example, who treated their husbands as they deserved to be treated, none of this would have happened. One thought led to another, and to the idea of going out. She got dressed and went to visit Sofia, an old school friend, just to clear her head, and certainly not to divulge anything.",CO120CL12
5037,34,"Sofia was thirty, two years older than Mariana. She was tall, sturdy, and very sure of herself. She greeted her friend with the usual show of affection and, when Mariana said nothing, she guessed at once that something was very much amiss. Adieu to Mariana’s best intentions! Within twenty minutes she had told her friend everything. Sofia laughed, shrugged her shoulders, and told her it wasn’t her husband’s fault at all.",CO120CL12
5038,35,"“Oh, I know, it’s my fault entirely,” agreed Mariana.",CO120CL12
5039,36,"“Don’t be silly, my dear! You’ve just been far too soft with him. You must be strong, for once; take no notice; don’t speak to him for a while, and when he comes to patch things up, tell him he must first change his hat.”",CO120CL12
5040,37,"“Goodness, but it seems such a trivial thing . . .”",CO120CL12
5041,38,"“At the end of the day, he’s just as right as all the others. Take that chump Beatriz: Hasn’t she gone and disappeared off to the country, just because her husband took a dislike to an Englishman who was in the habit of riding past their house every afternoon? Poor Englishman! Naturally, he didn’t even notice she’d gone. We women can live very happily with our husbands, in mutual respect, not frustrating each other’s desires and without resorting to stubborn outbursts or despotism.",CO120CL12
5042,39,"Look, I get on very well with my Ricardo, perfectly harmoniously. Whatever I ask him to do, he does immediately, even when he doesn’t want to; I only need to frown and he obeys. He wouldn’t give me any trouble over a hat! Certainly not! Where would that lead? No, he’d jolly well get a new hat, whether he wanted to or not.”",CO120CL12
5043,40,"Mariana listened enviously to this delightful description of conjugal bliss. The clarion call of Eve’s rebellion reverberated within her, and meeting her friend gave her an irresistible itch for independence and free will. To complete the picture, Sofia was not only very much her own mistress, but also the mistress of everyone else too; she had eyes for all the Englishmen, whether on horseback or afoot.",CO120CL12
5044,41,"She was an honest woman, but also a flirt; the word is rather crude, but there’s no time now to find a more delicate one. She flirted left, right, and center, out of a necessity of nature, a habit of her maiden days. It was the small change of love, and she distributed it to all the paupers who knocked on her door: a nickel to one, a dime to another, never as much as five mil-réis, still less anything more substantial.",CO120CL12
5045,42,"These charitable urges now induced her to propose to Mariana that they take a stroll together, see the shops, and admire some fine, dignified hats while they were at it. Mariana accepted; a little demon was firing up within her the furies of revenge. Moreover, her friend had Bonaparte’s powers of persuasion and gave her no time to reflect. Of course she would go; she was tired of living like a prisoner in her own home. She, too, wanted to live a little.",CO120CL12
5046,43,"While Sofia went to dress, Mariana remained in the drawing room, restless and rather pleased with herself. She planned out what remained of her week, marking the day and time for each appointment like fixtures on an official journey. She stood up, sat down, went over to the window, while she waited for her friend.",CO120CL12
5047,44,“Has she died or something?” she said to herself from time to time.,CO120CL12
5048,45,"Once, when she went to the window, she saw a young man pass by on horseback. He wasn’t English, but he made her think of Beatriz, whose husband had taken her off to the country due to his distrust of an Englishman, and she felt swelling within her a hatred of the entire masculine race—except, perhaps, for young men on horseback.",CO120CL12
5049,46,"To be honest, this one was far too affected for her taste; he stuck out his legs in the stirrups just to show off his boots, and rested one hand on his waist as if he were a mannequin. Mariana noted these two defects, but thought that his hat made up for them. Not that it was a top hat; it was a bowler, but entirely appropriate for equestrian purposes. It was not covering the head of a distinguished lawyer on his way to the office, but that of a man simply enjoying himself or passing the time.",CO120CL12
5050,47,"The slow, leisurely click of Sofia’s heels came down the stairs. “Ready!” she said a moment later upon entering the drawing room. She really did look lovely. We already know she was tall. Her hat gave her an even more commanding air, and a devilish black silk dress, molding the curves of her bust, made her even more striking. Next to her, Mariana disappeared somewhat—one needed to look carefully to see that she did in fact have very pretty features, beautiful eyes, and a natural elegance.",CO120CL12
5051,48,"The worst of it was that Sofia instantly monopolized all attention, and if there were only a limited amount of time to observe them both, Sofia grabbed it all for herself. This remark would be incomplete if I did not add that Sofia was perfectly aware of her superiority, and for this very reason appreciated the charms of women like Mariana, because they were less obvious or effusive. If this is a flaw, it is not for me to correct it.",CO120CL12
5052,49,“Where are we going?” asked Mariana.,CO120CL12
5053,50,"“Don’t be silly! We’re going for a little trip into town. Now, let’s see: I’m going to have my picture taken, then I’m going to the dentist. No, let’s go to the dentist first. Don’t you need to go to the dentist?”",CO120CL12
5054,51,“No.”,CO120CL12
5055,52,“Or have your picture taken?”,CO120CL12
5056,53,“I’ve got lots already. And why do you need a picture? To give to ‘you-know-who’?”,CO120CL12
5057,54,"Sofia realized that her friend’s resentment had not abated and, as they walked, she took care to add some more fuel to the fire. She told Mariana that, while it wouldn’t be easy, there was still time to free herself. And that she would teach her a way of slipping the shackles of tyranny. It was best not to do it in a single bound, but slowly and surely, so that the first he’d know about it was when she was standing over him with her foot placed firmly on his neck. It would be a matter of a few weeks, three or four at the most. Sofia was ready and willing to help her. And she told Mariana again not to be so soft, that she was no one’s slave, and so on. As she walked, Mariana’s heart sang to itself the “Marseillaise” of matrimony.",CO120CL12
5058,55,"They reached Rua do Ouvidor. It was just after noon. There were crowds of people walking, or just standing around, the usual hustle and bustle. Mariana felt a little overwhelmed, as she always did. Uniformity and tranquility, the foundations of her life and character, took their usual knocks from all that hurly-burly. She could scarcely thread her way through the groups of people, still less know where to fix her gaze, such was the jumble of people and the profusion of shops. She stuck close to her friend, and, not noticing that they had passed the dentist’s, was anxious to reach the place and get inside. It would be a refuge, certainly better than the hullabaloo of Rua do Ouvidor.",CO120CL12
5059,56,"“Really, this street!” she kept saying.",CO120CL12
5060,57,"“What?” responded Sofia airily, turning her head toward her friend, and her eyes toward a young man on the sidewalk opposite.",CO120CL12
5061,58,"As an experienced navigator of these choppy waters, Sofia slipped through and around the groups of people with great skill and composure. Her figure commanded attention: those who knew her were pleased to see her again, while those who did not, stopped or turned to admire her élan. And the bounteous lady, full of charity, swept her eyes from left to right, to no great scandal, since Mariana’s presence gave everything a veneer of decency. She babbled away, barely seeming to hear Mariana’s replies, commenting on everything and everyone they passed: people, shops, hats . . . For under the midday sun on Rua do Ouvidor, there were many hats, for both ladies and gentlemen.",CO120CL12
5062,59,"“Look at that one,” Sofia would say.",CO120CL12
5063,60,"And Mariana would promptly look, although not quite knowing where to look, because everywhere was a swirling kaleidoscope of hats. “Where’s the dentist’s?” she asked her friend. She had to repeat her question before Sofia told her that they had already passed the surgery; now they were going to the end of the street; they would come back later, and finally they did.",CO120CL12
5064,61,“Ouf!” sighed Mariana as they entered the hallway.,CO120CL12
5065,62,“My goodness! What’s the matter? Anyone would think you were just up from the country!”,CO120CL12
5066,63,"There were already some patients in the dentist’s waiting room. Mariana couldn’t see a single face she recognized, and went to the window to avoid the gaze of strangers. From the window she could enjoy the street without all the pushing and shoving. She leaned back; Sofia came to join her. Some men’s hats down below turned to stare up at them; others, passing by, did the same. Mariana felt annoyed by their insistence, but, when she noticed that they were staring principally at her friend, her irritation dissolved into a kind of envy.",CO120CL12
5067,64,"Meanwhile, Sofia was telling her all about some of the hats—or, more precisely, their romantic adventures. One of them was highly thought-of by Miss so-and-so; another was madly in love with Madam you-know-who, who was also in love with him, so much so that they were sure to be seen on Rua do Ouvidor on Wednesdays and Saturdays between two and three in the afternoon. Mariana listened in bewilderment. The hat was indeed rather handsome, and wore a beautiful necktie, and had an air about it that was somewhere between elegant and raffish, but . . .",CO120CL12
5068,65,"“I can’t swear to it, mind,” Sofia continued, “but that’s what people are saying.”",CO120CL12
5069,66,"Mariana gazed pensively at the hat in question. It was now joined by three more, of equal poise and elegance; the four were probably talking about them, and in favorable terms too. Mariana blushed deeply, looked away, then back again, then retreated into the room. As she did so, she noticed two ladies who had just arrived, and with them a young man who promptly stood up and came to greet her effusively. He had been her very first suitor.",CO120CL12
5070,67,"He would be about thirty-three now. He had been away from Rio, first to somewhere in the interior, then to Europe, then as governor of one of the southern provinces. He was of medium height, pale, with a rather skimpy beard and clothes that were straining at the seams. He was holding a new top hat: black, serious, gubernatorial, ministerial even; a hat befitting his person and his ambitions.",CO120CL12
5071,68,"Mariana, however, could hardly look at him. She became so flustered and disorientated by the presence of a man whom she had known in such special circumstances, and had not seen since 1877, that she was unable to take in anything at all. She proffered him the tips of her fingers, apparently murmured some kind of response, and was about to rejoin Sofia at the window, when her friend turned from the window and came toward her.",CO120CL12
5072,69,"Sofia also knew the new arrival. They exchanged a few words. Mariana whispered impatiently in her friend’s ear that perhaps it would be better to leave their teeth for another day, but Sofia said no; it would only take half an hour, or three-quarters at most. Mariana felt very uncomfortable: the presence of that man tied her in knots, throwing her into a state of conflict and confusion.",CO120CL12
5073,70,"It was all her husband’s fault. If he hadn’t been so stubborn, and, even worse, made fun of her, none of this would have happened. Mariana swore she would have her revenge. She thought about her house, so pretty and peaceful, where she could be right now, as usual, without all this pushing and shoving in the street, without having to be so dependent on her friend . . .",CO120CL12
5074,71,"“Mariana,” said Sofia, “Senhor Viçoso insists that he’s very thin. Don’t you think he’s put on weight since last year? Don’t you remember him from last year?”",CO120CL12
5075,72,"Senhor Viçoso was the name of the erstwhile suitor, now chatting with Sofia and casting frequent glances in Mariana’s direction. She shook her head. He seized the opportunity to draw her into the conversation, remarking that, as a matter of fact, he hadn’t seen her for several years. He underlined these words with a rather sad, meaningful gaze. Then he opened up his tool kit of topics and pulled out the opera. What did they think of the cast?",CO120CL12
5076,73,"In his opinion they were excellent, except for the baritone; the baritone seemed to him rather dull. Sofia protested, but Senhor Viçoso insisted, adding that, in London, where he’d heard him for the first time, he’d thought the same thing. The ladies, of course, were quite another matter; both the soprano and the contralto were first-rate. And he discussed the various operas he had seen, referring to the most famous passages, praising the orchestra, particularly in Les Huguenots . . . He had spotted Mariana on the last night, sitting in the fourth or fifth box on the left, wasn’t that so?",CO120CL12
5077,74,"“Yes, we were there,” she murmured, emphasizing the plural.",CO120CL12
5078,75,"“Although I haven’t seen you at the Cassino even once,” he continued.",CO120CL12
5079,76,"“Oh, she’s become quite the little peekaboo!” interrupted Sofia, laughing.",CO120CL12
5080,77,"Viçoso had greatly enjoyed the last ball at the Cassino, and shared his recollections of it minutely; Sofia did likewise. The most elaborate toilettes were described by both of them in particular detail, followed by the various people they had seen, the different characters, and a few barbed comments, albeit anodyne enough not to harm anyone. Mariana listened without the slightest interest; two or three times she even got up and went over to the window, but the hats were so numerous and so inquisitive that she sat back down again. Silently, she called her friend some rather ugly names; I won’t give them here because it’s unnecessary and, moreover, in rather bad taste to reveal what one young lady might think of another in a moment of irritation.",CO120CL12
5081,78,“And the races at the Jockey Club?” asked the former governor.,CO120CL12
5082,79,"Mariana again shook her head. She hadn’t been to the races that year. Well, she had missed a treat, especially the one before last; it had been a very lively affair and the horses really top-notch. Better even than the races at Epsom, which he’d attended when he was in England. Sofia said that, yes, indeed, the race before last really had been a credit to the Jockey Club,",CO120CL12
5083,80,"and confessed that she had enjoyed herself immensely; it had been positively thrilling. The conversation drifted on to two concerts taking place that very week, then it took the ferry and climbed the hills to Petrópolis, where two diplomats provided ample hospitality. When they spoke of a minister’s wife, Sofia remembered to flatter the former governor and declare that he, too, must marry, since he would soon be in government.",CO120CL12
5084,81,"Viçoso squirmed with pleasure and smiled, shaking his head; then, looking at Mariana, he said that he would probably never marry. Mariana turned bright red and stood up.",CO120CL12
5085,82,"“You seem in a great hurry,” Sofia said to her. “What time is it?” she continued, turning toward Viçoso.",CO120CL12
5086,83,“Nearly three!” he exclaimed.,CO120CL12
5087,84,"It was getting late; he had to go to the Chamber of Deputies. He went over to speak to the two ladies he had been accompanying, cousins of his, and made his excuses; he came back to say goodbye to Sofia and Mariana, but Sofia said that she was leaving too. She simply couldn’t wait a moment longer. In fact, the idea of going to the Chamber of Deputies had begun to scintillate inside her head.",CO120CL12
5088,85,“Shall we all go to the Chamber?” she proposed to Mariana.,CO120CL12
5089,86,"“Oh, no,” replied Mariana. “I couldn’t. I’m so tired.”",CO120CL12
5090,87,"“Come on, let’s go. Just for a little bit; I’m very tired, too, but . . .”",CO120CL12
5091,88,"Mariana resisted a little longer, but resisting Sofia—like a dove arguing with a hawk—was completely pointless. There was nothing for it; she went. The street was busier now, people passing this way and that on both sides of the street, and getting in each other’s way at the street corners. The ever-solicitous former governor escorted both ladies, having offered to find them somewhere to sit in the gallery.",CO120CL12
5092,89,"Mariana’s soul felt ever more torn apart by all this confusion of people and things. She had completely lost her original motivation, and the resentment that had propelled her into that audacious, short-lived flight began to slow its wings, or give up entirely. Once again she thought of her house, so quiet, so tidy, everything in its place, with no pushing or shoving, and, most of all, no unexpected changes. Her impatience grew, and with it her anger.",CO120CL12
5093,90,"She wasn’t listening to a word Viçoso was saying, even though he was talking rather loudly, and principally to her. She couldn’t hear and she didn’t want to hear. She merely prayed to God to make the time pass quickly. They arrived at the Chamber and went up to the gallery. The rustle of skirts attracted the attention of the twenty or so deputies who were still in the Chamber listening to a speech about the budget. As soon as Viçoso excused himself and left, Mariana quickly told her friend not to play a trick on her like that again.",CO120CL12
5094,91,“Like what?” asked Sofia.,CO120CL12
5095,92,“Like having me run around all over the place like some madwoman. What have I got to do with the Chamber of Deputies? Why should I care about speeches I don’t even understand?”,CO120CL12
5096,93,"Sofia smiled, fluttered her fan, and received the full attention of one of the ministers. Many eyes gazed at her whenever she visited the Chamber, but this particular minister’s eyes had a particularly warm, pleading expression. It may be assumed, therefore, that she did not receive his gaze unexpectedly; it could even be said that she sought it out of curiosity. While she was acknowledging this legislative attention, she replied gently to her friend that she was very sorry and had meant well, and had simply wanted to restore Mariana’s independence.",CO120CL12
5097,94,"“But if you find me irritating, then don’t come out with me again,” Sofia concluded.",CO120CL12
5098,95,"And, leaning forward a little, she said:",CO120CL12
5099,96,“Look at the minister of justice.”,CO120CL12
5100,97,"Mariana had no choice but to look at the minister of justice. He was bravely enduring a speech by a government supporter, in which the speaker was extolling the merits of the criminal justice system and, along the way, painstakingly summarizing all the old colonial legislation on the subject. There were no interruptions; just a polite, resigned, cautious silence. Mariana’s eyes drifted from one side to the other, utterly bored; Sofia was constantly saying things to her, as an excuse for making all kinds of elegant gestures. After fifteen minutes, the Chamber stirred into life, thanks to a remark made by the speaker and an objection from the opposition. Heckles were exchanged, the temperature rose, and there ensued an uproar that lasted nearly a quarter of an hour.",CO120CL12
5101,98,"Mariana did not find this diversion in the least diverting; indeed, her placid, equable nature was thrown into a spin by such unexpected commotion. She even got up to leave, then sat down again. She was ready now to stay until the end, repentant and resolved to keep her marital woes to herself. Doubts began to creep in.",CO120CL12
5102,99,"She had been right to ask her husband to change his hat, but was it worth all this heartache? Was it reasonable to make such a fuss? He had been cruel and sarcastic, but it was, after all, the first time she had put her foot down and, naturally, the novelty had irritated him. At any rate, it had been a mistake to spill the beans to her friend. Sofia might go and tell others . . .",CO120CL12
5103,100,"The thought sent a chill down Mariana’s spine; her friend’s indiscretion was assured; she herself had heard Sofia tell many tales about hats, male and female, engaged in much more than a simple marital tiff. Mariana felt the need to flatter her, and covered up her impatience and annoyance with a mask of hypocritical docility. She, too, began to smile and make random observations about this or that deputy, and in this uneasy truce they reached the end of the speech and the session.",CO120CL12
5104,101,"It was gone four o’clock. “Time for home,” said Sofia. Mariana agreed, although she seemed in no hurry, and they made their way back along Rua do Ouvidor. Walking up the street and catching the streetcar completed Mariana’s mental exhaustion, and she only began to breathe more easily when she saw that she really was on her way home. Shortly before Sofia got off, Mariana asked her keep to herself what she had told her, and Sofia promised that she would.",CO120CL12
5105,102,"Mariana gave a sigh of relief. The dove was free of the hawk. Her soul was aching from all the pushing and shoving, dizzy from all those disparate people and things. What she needed was equilibrium and peace. She was nearly home; as she watched the neighboring houses and gardens pass by, Mariana felt her spirits lift. At last she arrived; she entered the garden, and took a deep breath. This was her world, except for a flowerpot that the gardener had moved.",CO120CL12
5106,103,"“João, put that flowerpot back where it was,” she said.",CO120CL12
5107,104,"Everything else was in order, the entrance hall, the drawing room, the dining room, the bedrooms, everything. First of all, Mariana sat down, in various different places, looking carefully at all the objects, so still and orderly. After a whole day of swirling variety, the monotony restored her peace of mind, and had never before seemed so delightful. The truth was she’d made a mistake.",CO120CL12
5108,105,"She tried to relive the day’s events, but couldn’t; her soul was gently slipping back into its home comforts. At most, she thought about Viçoso, whom she now, rather unfairly, thought ridiculous. She undressed slowly and lovingly, precisely removing and putting away each item of clothing. Once she was undressed, she thought again about the quarrel with her husband. All things considered, she realized that it had been mainly her fault. Why such stubbornness over a hat that her husband had been wearing for years? And, besides, her father was a terrible fusspot.",CO120CL12
5109,106,"“I’ll wait and see the look on his face when he comes home,” she thought.",CO120CL12
5110,107,"It was half-past five; he wouldn’t be long. Mariana went to the front room, peered out the window, listened for the streetcar, but heard nothing. She sat down by the window with Ivanhoe in her hands, trying, and failing, to read. Her eyes skimmed to the end of the page, then back to the beginning; firstly, because she couldn’t grasp the meaning, and secondly, because time and again her eyes would wander from the page to admire the perfect folds of the curtains or some other feature of the room. Ah, blessèd monotony, cradling her in thy eternal bosom.",CO120CL12
5111,108,"Eventually the streetcar stopped outside the house and her husband got off; the garden gate creaked open. Mariana went to the window and peered out. Conrado was walking slowly up the garden path, looking to left and right, his hat on his head—not the famous hat he always wore, but another one, the one his wife had asked him to wear that very morning. It came as a rude shock to Mariana, just like the flowerpot in the garden being moved, or as if she’d come across a page of Voltaire in her copy of Moreninha or Ivanhoe.",CO120CL12
5112,109,"It was a jarring note in the harmonious sonata of life. No, that hat would never do. Really, whatever had possessed her to make him get rid of the old one that suited him so well? Even if it wasn’t perhaps the most appropriate of hats, it had served him for many years, and framed his face so well . . . Conrado came in through a side door. Mariana flung her arms around him.",CO120CL12
5113,110,"“So, is it over?” he asked, circling her waist.",CO120CL12
5114,111,"“Listen, darling,” she replied, giving him the divinest of kisses, “throw that hat away; the other one’s much nicer.”",CO120CL12

5122,8,"Conrado, a lawyer with offices on Rua da Quitanda, wore it to the city every day, and it went with him to all his court hearings; he only refrained from wearing it at receptions, the opera, funerals, and formal social visits. Otherwise, it was a constant feature, and had been so for the entire five or six years of his marriage. Until, on that particular April morning, after finishing their breakfast, Conrado began to roll a cigarette, and Mariana announced with a smile that she had something to ask him.",CO120CL10

Conrado was shocked. He knew his wife; she was usually such a passive creature, sweet and gently amenable as the situation demanded, capable of wearing a bonnet, a wimple, or a royal tiara with the same divine indifference.",CO120CL10
5132,18,"The proof of this is that, having been part of a rather fast set during the two years before marrying, once she did marry, she quickly settled into homelier habits. She did go out from time to time, mainly at the behest of her husband, but she was only truly at ease in her own home. Furniture, curtains, and ornaments made up for the lack of children; she loved them like a mother, and such was the harmony between person and surroundings that she took particular pleasure in everything being in its proper place, the curtains hanging in the same neat folds, and so on.",CO120CL10
5133,19,"For example, one of the three windows that gave onto the street was always left half open, and it was always the same one. Even her husband’s study did not escape her fastidious demands, for she carefully maintained, and at times restored, his books, so that they were always in the same state of disorder. Her mental habits were equally uniform.",CO120CL10
5134,20,"Mariana possessed very few ideas and read only the same books again and again: Macedo’s Moreninha, seven times; Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe and The Pirate, ten times each; Le Mot de l’Énigme by Madame Craven, eleven times.",CO120CL10
5135,21,"In the light of all this, how can one explain this business with the hat? The previous evening, while her husband was attending a meeting of the bar association, Mariana’s father came to their house. He was a kindly old man, wiry and somewhat ponderous, a retired civil servant who was consumed by nostalgia for the days when employees wore frock coats to the office.",CO120CL10
5136,22,"Even now, a frock coat was what he wore to funerals, not for the reasons a reader might suspect, such as the solemnity of death or the gravity of a final farewell, but for the less philosophical reason that this was how things used to be. He always gave the same reason, whether it was frock coats at funerals, or having dinner at two o’clock in the afternoon, or twenty other such foibles. He was so chained to his habits that, on his daughter’s wedding anniversary, he would go to their house at six o’clock, having already dined and digested, and watch them eat and, at the end, take a little dessert, a glass of port, and some coffee.",CO120CL10
5137,23,"Given that he was Conrado’s father-in-law, how could he possibly approve of his son-in-law’s bowler hat? He put up with it in silence, in consideration of the man’s other qualities, but nothing more. That day, however, he had caught sight of it in the street, conversing with other hats—top hats belonging to distinguished gentlemen—and never had it seemed so vile. That night, finding his daughter alone, he opened his heart to her, dubbing the bowler hat the “abomination of abominations,” and urging her to banish it.",CO120CL10
5138,24,"Conrado was unaware that this was the origin of the request. Knowing his wife’s docile nature, he did not understand her resistance, and, because he was willful and authoritarian, her stubbornness irritated him deeply. Even so, he kept these feelings to himself, preferring simply to scoff; he spoke to her with such scathing irony and disdain that the poor lady felt utterly humiliated. Twice Mariana tried to leave the table and twice he forced her to stay, the first time by grabbing her lightly by the wrist, the second time by subduing her with a withering look. And he said with a smile:",CO120CL10
5139,25,"“Now, then, sweetie, I have a philosophical reason for not doing as you ask. I have never told you this before, but I will now tell you everything.”",CO120CL10
5140,26,"Mariana bit her lip and said no more; she picked up a knife and began to tap it slowly on the table, just to have something to do, but her husband wouldn’t even allow her this; he delicately took the knife from her and went on:",CO120CL10
5141,27,"“Choosing a hat is no random act, as you might suppose; it is governed by a metaphysical principle. Do not think that a man who buys a hat does so freely and voluntarily; the truth is that he is obeying an obscure form of determinism. The illusion of liberty is deeply embedded in the purchaser’s psyche, and shared by hatters, who, after watching a customer try on thirty or forty hats, then leave without buying a single one, imagine that he is merely searching for the most elegant combination.",CO120CL10
5142,28,"The metaphysical principle is this: the hat completes the man; it is an extension of his head, a combination decreed ab eterno and that no man may put asunder without committing an act of mutilation. This is a profound question that no one has yet considered. Wise men have studied everything from asteroids to worms, or, in bibliographical terms, from Laplace—you mean you’ve never read Laplace?",CO120CL10
5143,29,"—well, from Laplace and his Mécanique Céleste to Darwin and his curious book about worms, and yet they’ve never thought to pause in front of a hat and study it from every angle. No one has noticed that there is a whole metaphysics of hats. Perhaps I should write an essay on the subject myself. However, it’s now a quarter to ten and I really must go, but do think about it and you’ll see what I mean. Who knows? Perhaps it’s not even the hat that complements the man, but the man who complements the hat.”",CO120CL10
5144,30,"Mariana finally wrested back her independence and got up from the table. She had not understood a word of his barbed terminology, nor his peculiar theory, but she sensed his sarcasm and, inside, she wept with humiliation. Her husband went upstairs to get dressed to go out, came back down a few minutes later, and stood in front of her with the infamous hat on his head. Mariana really did think it made him look seedy, vulgar, and not at all serious. Conrado ceremoniously bade her good day and left.",CO120CL10
5145,31,"The lady’s irritation had subsided considerably, but her feelings of humiliation remained. Mariana did not wail and weep, as she thought she would, but, thinking it all over, she recalled the simplicity of her request and Conrado’s sarcastic response, and, while she recognized that she had been somewhat demanding, she found no justification whatsoever for such excesses. She paced back and forth, unable to stand still; she went into the drawing room, approached the half-open window, and watched her husband standing in the street waiting for the streetcar, with his back to the house and that eternal, despicable hat on his head.",CO120CL10
5146,32,"Mariana felt herself overcome with hatred for that ridiculous item; she couldn’t understand how she had put up with it for so many years. And she thought of all those years of docility and acquiescence to her husband’s whims and desires, and wondered if that might not be the very thing that had led to his reaction that morning.",CO120CL10
5147,33,"She called herself a fool and a ninny; if she had behaved like so many other wives, Clara or Sofia, for example, who treated their husbands as they deserved to be treated, none of this would have happened. One thought led to another, and to the idea of going out. She got dressed and went to visit Sofia, an old school friend, just to clear her head, and certainly not to divulge anything.",CO120CL10
5148,34,"Sofia was thirty, two years older than Mariana. She was tall, sturdy, and very sure of herself. She greeted her friend with the usual show of affection and, when Mariana said nothing, she guessed at once that something was very much amiss. Adieu to Mariana’s best intentions! Within twenty minutes she had told her friend everything. Sofia laughed, shrugged her shoulders, and told her it wasn’t her husband’s fault at all.",CO120CL10
5149,35,"“Oh, I know, it’s my fault entirely,” agreed Mariana.",CO120CL10
5150,36,"“Don’t be silly, my dear! You’ve just been far too soft with him. You must be strong, for once; take no notice; don’t speak to him for a while, and when he comes to patch things up, tell him he must first change his hat.”",CO120CL10
5151,37,"“Goodness, but it seems such a trivial thing . . .”",CO120CL10
5152,38,"“At the end of the day, he’s just as right as all the others. Take that chump Beatriz: Hasn’t she gone and disappeared off to the country, just because her husband took a dislike to an Englishman who was in the habit of riding past their house every afternoon? Poor Englishman! Naturally, he didn’t even notice she’d gone. We women can live very happily with our husbands, in mutual respect, not frustrating each other’s desires and without resorting to stubborn outbursts or despotism.",CO120CL10
5153,39,"Look, I get on very well with my Ricardo, perfectly harmoniously. Whatever I ask him to do, he does immediately, even when he doesn’t want to; I only need to frown and he obeys. He wouldn’t give me any trouble over a hat! Certainly not! Where would that lead? No, he’d jolly well get a new hat, whether he wanted to or not.”",CO120CL10
5154,40,"Mariana listened enviously to this delightful description of conjugal bliss. The clarion call of Eve’s rebellion reverberated within her, and meeting her friend gave her an irresistible itch for independence and free will. To complete the picture, Sofia was not only very much her own mistress, but also the mistress of everyone else too; she had eyes for all the Englishmen, whether on horseback or afoot. She was an honest woman, but also a flirt; the word is rather crude, but there’s no time now to find a more delicate one.",CO120CL10
5155,41,"She flirted left, right, and center, out of a necessity of nature, a habit of her maiden days. It was the small change of love, and she distributed it to all the paupers who knocked on her door: a nickel to one, a dime to another, never as much as five mil-réis, still less anything more substantial.",CO120CL10
5156,42,"These charitable urges now induced her to propose to Mariana that they take a stroll together, see the shops, and admire some fine, dignified hats while they were at it. Mariana accepted; a little demon was firing up within her the furies of revenge. Moreover, her friend had Bonaparte’s powers of persuasion and gave her no time to reflect. Of course she would go; she was tired of living like a prisoner in her own home. She, too, wanted to live a little.",CO120CL10
5157,43,"While Sofia went to dress, Mariana remained in the drawing room, restless and rather pleased with herself. She planned out what remained of her week, marking the day and time for each appointment like fixtures on an official journey. She stood up, sat down, went over to the window, while she waited for her friend.",CO120CL10
5158,44,“Has she died or something?” she said to herself from time to time.,CO120CL10
5159,45,"Once, when she went to the window, she saw a young man pass by on horseback. He wasn’t English, but he made her think of Beatriz, whose husband had taken her off to the country due to his distrust of an Englishman, and she felt swelling within her a hatred of the entire masculine race—except, perhaps, for young men on horseback.",CO120CL10
5160,46,"To be honest, this one was far too affected for her taste; he stuck out his legs in the stirrups just to show off his boots, and rested one hand on his waist as if he were a mannequin. Mariana noted these two defects, but thought that his hat made up for them. Not that it was a top hat; it was a bowler, but entirely appropriate for equestrian purposes. It was not covering the head of a distinguished lawyer on his way to the office, but that of a man simply enjoying himself or passing the time.",CO120CL10
5161,47,"The slow, leisurely click of Sofia’s heels came down the stairs. “Ready!” she said a moment later upon entering the drawing room. She really did look lovely. We already know she was tall. Her hat gave her an even more commanding air, and a devilish black silk dress, molding the curves of her bust, made her even more striking. Next to her, Mariana disappeared somewhat—one needed to look carefully to see that she did in fact have very pretty features, beautiful eyes, and a natural elegance.",CO120CL10
5162,48,"The worst of it was that Sofia instantly monopolized all attention, and if there were only a limited amount of time to observe them both, Sofia grabbed it all for herself. This remark would be incomplete if I did not add that Sofia was perfectly aware of her superiority, and for this very reason appreciated the charms of women like Mariana, because they were less obvious or effusive. If this is a flaw, it is not for me to correct it.",CO120CL10
5163,49,“Where are we going?” asked Mariana.,CO120CL10
5164,50,"“Don’t be silly! We’re going for a little trip into town. Now, let’s see: I’m going to have my picture taken, then I’m going to the dentist. No, let’s go to the dentist first. Don’t you need to go to the dentist?”",CO120CL10
5165,51,“No.”,CO120CL10
5166,52,“Or have your picture taken?”,CO120CL10
5167,53,“I’ve got lots already. And why do you need a picture? To give to ‘you-know-who’?”,CO120CL10
5168,54,"Sofia realized that her friend’s resentment had not abated and, as they walked, she took care to add some more fuel to the fire. She told Mariana that, while it wouldn’t be easy, there was still time to free herself. And that she would teach her a way of slipping the shackles of tyranny. It was best not to do it in a single bound, but slowly and surely, so that the first he’d know about it was when she was standing over him with her foot placed firmly on his neck. It would be a matter of a few weeks, three or four at the most. Sofia was ready and willing to help her. And she told Mariana again not to be so soft, that she was no one’s slave, and so on. As she walked, Mariana’s heart sang to itself the “Marseillaise” of matrimony.",CO120CL10
5169,55,"They reached Rua do Ouvidor. It was just after noon. There were crowds of people walking, or just standing around, the usual hustle and bustle. Mariana felt a little overwhelmed, as she always did. Uniformity and tranquility, the foundations of her life and character, took their usual knocks from all that hurly-burly. She could scarcely thread her way through the groups of people, still less know where to fix her gaze, such was the jumble of people and the profusion of shops. She stuck close to her friend, and, not noticing that they had passed the dentist’s, was anxious to reach the place and get inside. It would be a refuge, certainly better than the hullabaloo of Rua do Ouvidor.",CO120CL10
5170,56,"“Really, this street!” she kept saying.",CO120CL10
5171,57,"“What?” responded Sofia airily, turning her head toward her friend, and her eyes toward a young man on the sidewalk opposite.",CO120CL10
5172,58,"As an experienced navigator of these choppy waters, Sofia slipped through and around the groups of people with great skill and composure. Her figure commanded attention: those who knew her were pleased to see her again, while those who did not, stopped or turned to admire her élan. And the bounteous lady, full of charity, swept her eyes from left to right, to no great scandal, since Mariana’s presence gave everything a veneer of decency. She babbled away, barely seeming to hear Mariana’s replies, commenting on everything and everyone they passed: people, shops, hats . . . For under the midday sun on Rua do Ouvidor, there were many hats, for both ladies and gentlemen.",CO120CL10
5173,59,"“Look at that one,” Sofia would say.",CO120CL10
5174,60,"And Mariana would promptly look, although not quite knowing where to look, because everywhere was a swirling kaleidoscope of hats. “Where’s the dentist’s?” she asked her friend. She had to repeat her question before Sofia told her that they had already passed the surgery; now they were going to the end of the street; they would come back later, and finally they did.",CO120CL10
5175,61,“Ouf!” sighed Mariana as they entered the hallway.,CO120CL10
5176,62,“My goodness! What’s the matter? Anyone would think you were just up from the country!”,CO120CL10
5177,63,"There were already some patients in the dentist’s waiting room. Mariana couldn’t see a single face she recognized, and went to the window to avoid the gaze of strangers. From the window she could enjoy the street without all the pushing and shoving. She leaned back; Sofia came to join her. Some men’s hats down below turned to stare up at them; others, passing by, did the same. Mariana felt annoyed by their insistence, but, when she noticed that they were staring principally at her friend, her irritation dissolved into a kind of envy.",CO120CL10
5178,64,"Meanwhile, Sofia was telling her all about some of the hats—or, more precisely, their romantic adventures. One of them was highly thought-of by Miss so-and-so; another was madly in love with Madam you-know-who, who was also in love with him, so much so that they were sure to be seen on Rua do Ouvidor on Wednesdays and Saturdays between two and three in the afternoon. Mariana listened in bewilderment. The hat was indeed rather handsome, and wore a beautiful necktie, and had an air about it that was somewhere between elegant and raffish, but . . .",CO120CL10
5179,65,"“I can’t swear to it, mind,” Sofia continued, “but that’s what people are saying.”",CO120CL10
5180,66,"Mariana gazed pensively at the hat in question. It was now joined by three more, of equal poise and elegance; the four were probably talking about them, and in favorable terms too. Mariana blushed deeply, looked away, then back again, then retreated into the room. As she did so, she noticed two ladies who had just arrived, and with them a young man who promptly stood up and came to greet her effusively. He had been her very first suitor.",CO120CL10
5181,67,"He would be about thirty-three now. He had been away from Rio, first to somewhere in the interior, then to Europe, then as governor of one of the southern provinces. He was of medium height, pale, with a rather skimpy beard and clothes that were straining at the seams. He was holding a new top hat: black, serious, gubernatorial, ministerial even; a hat befitting his person and his ambitions.",CO120CL10
5182,68,"Mariana, however, could hardly look at him. She became so flustered and disorientated by the presence of a man whom she had known in such special circumstances, and had not seen since 1877, that she was unable to take in anything at all. She proffered him the tips of her fingers, apparently murmured some kind of response, and was about to rejoin Sofia at the window, when her friend turned from the window and came toward her.",CO120CL10
5183,69,"Sofia also knew the new arrival. They exchanged a few words. Mariana whispered impatiently in her friend’s ear that perhaps it would be better to leave their teeth for another day, but Sofia said no; it would only take half an hour, or three-quarters at most. Mariana felt very uncomfortable: the presence of that man tied her in knots, throwing her into a state of conflict and confusion.",CO120CL10
5184,70,"It was all her husband’s fault. If he hadn’t been so stubborn, and, even worse, made fun of her, none of this would have happened. Mariana swore she would have her revenge. She thought about her house, so pretty and peaceful, where she could be right now, as usual, without all this pushing and shoving in the street, without having to be so dependent on her friend . . .",CO120CL10
5185,71,"“Mariana,” said Sofia, “Senhor Viçoso insists that he’s very thin. Don’t you think he’s put on weight since last year? Don’t you remember him from last year?”",CO120CL10
5186,72,"Senhor Viçoso was the name of the erstwhile suitor, now chatting with Sofia and casting frequent glances in Mariana’s direction. She shook her head. He seized the opportunity to draw her into the conversation, remarking that, as a matter of fact, he hadn’t seen her for several years. He underlined these words with a rather sad, meaningful gaze. Then he opened up his tool kit of topics and pulled out the opera. What did they think of the cast?",CO120CL10
5187,73,"In his opinion they were excellent, except for the baritone; the baritone seemed to him rather dull. Sofia protested, but Senhor Viçoso insisted, adding that, in London, where he’d heard him for the first time, he’d thought the same thing. The ladies, of course, were quite another matter; both the soprano and the contralto were first-rate. And he discussed the various operas he had seen, referring to the most famous passages, praising the orchestra, particularly in Les Huguenots . . . He had spotted Mariana on the last night, sitting in the fourth or fifth box on the left, wasn’t that so?",CO120CL10
5188,74,"“Yes, we were there,” she murmured, emphasizing the plural.",CO120CL10
5189,75,"“Although I haven’t seen you at the Cassino even once,” he continued.",CO120CL10
5190,76,"“Oh, she’s become quite the little peekaboo!” interrupted Sofia, laughing.",CO120CL10
5191,77,"Viçoso had greatly enjoyed the last ball at the Cassino, and shared his recollections of it minutely; Sofia did likewise. The most elaborate toilettes were described by both of them in particular detail, followed by the various people they had seen, the different characters, and a few barbed comments, albeit anodyne enough not to harm anyone. Mariana listened without the slightest interest; two or three times she even got up and went over to the window, but the hats were so numerous and so inquisitive that she sat back down again. Silently, she called her friend some rather ugly names; I won’t give them here because it’s unnecessary and, moreover, in rather bad taste to reveal what one young lady might think of another in a moment of irritation.",CO120CL10
5192,78,“And the races at the Jockey Club?” asked the former governor.,CO120CL10
5193,79,"Mariana again shook her head. She hadn’t been to the races that year. Well, she had missed a treat, especially the one before last; it had been a very lively affair and the horses really top-notch. Better even than the races at Epsom, which he’d attended when he was in England. Sofia said that, yes, indeed, the race before last really had been a credit to the Jockey Club,",CO120CL10
5194,80,"and confessed that she had enjoyed herself immensely; it had been positively thrilling. The conversation drifted on to two concerts taking place that very week, then it took the ferry and climbed the hills to Petrópolis, where two diplomats provided ample hospitality. When they spoke of a minister’s wife, Sofia remembered to flatter the former governor and declare that he, too, must marry, since he would soon be in government.",CO120CL10
5195,81,"Viçoso squirmed with pleasure and smiled, shaking his head; then, looking at Mariana, he said that he would probably never marry. Mariana turned bright red and stood up.",CO120CL10
5196,82,"“You seem in a great hurry,” Sofia said to her. “What time is it?” she continued, turning toward Viçoso.",CO120CL10
5197,83,“Nearly three!” he exclaimed.,CO120CL10
5198,84,"It was getting late; he had to go to the Chamber of Deputies. He went over to speak to the two ladies he had been accompanying, cousins of his, and made his excuses; he came back to say goodbye to Sofia and Mariana, but Sofia said that she was leaving too. She simply couldn’t wait a moment longer. In fact, the idea of going to the Chamber of Deputies had begun to scintillate inside her head.",CO120CL10
5199,85,“Shall we all go to the Chamber?” she proposed to Mariana.,CO120CL10
5200,86,"“Oh, no,” replied Mariana. “I couldn’t. I’m so tired.”",CO120CL10
5201,87,"“Come on, let’s go. Just for a little bit; I’m very tired, too, but . . .”",CO120CL10
5202,88,"Mariana resisted a little longer, but resisting Sofia—like a dove arguing with a hawk—was completely pointless. There was nothing for it; she went. The street was busier now, people passing this way and that on both sides of the street, and getting in each other’s way at the street corners. The ever-solicitous former governor escorted both ladies, having offered to find them somewhere to sit in the gallery.",CO120CL10
5203,89,"Mariana’s soul felt ever more torn apart by all this confusion of people and things. She had completely lost her original motivation, and the resentment that had propelled her into that audacious, short-lived flight began to slow its wings, or give up entirely. Once again she thought of her house, so quiet, so tidy, everything in its place, with no pushing or shoving, and, most of all, no unexpected changes. Her impatience grew, and with it her anger.",CO120CL10
5204,90,"She wasn’t listening to a word Viçoso was saying, even though he was talking rather loudly, and principally to her. She couldn’t hear and she didn’t want to hear. She merely prayed to God to make the time pass quickly. They arrived at the Chamber and went up to the gallery. The rustle of skirts attracted the attention of the twenty or so deputies who were still in the Chamber listening to a speech about the budget. As soon as Viçoso excused himself and left, Mariana quickly told her friend not to play a trick on her like that again.",CO120CL10
5205,91,“Like what?” asked Sofia.,CO120CL10
5206,92,“Like having me run around all over the place like some madwoman. What have I got to do with the Chamber of Deputies? Why should I care about speeches I don’t even understand?”,CO120CL10
5207,93,"Sofia smiled, fluttered her fan, and received the full attention of one of the ministers. Many eyes gazed at her whenever she visited the Chamber, but this particular minister’s eyes had a particularly warm, pleading expression. It may be assumed, therefore, that she did not receive his gaze unexpectedly; it could even be said that she sought it out of curiosity. While she was acknowledging this legislative attention, she replied gently to her friend that she was very sorry and had meant well, and had simply wanted to restore Mariana’s independence.",CO120CL10
5208,94,"“But if you find me irritating, then don’t come out with me again,” Sofia concluded.",CO120CL10
5209,95,"And, leaning forward a little, she said:",CO120CL10
5210,96,“Look at the minister of justice.”,CO120CL10
5211,97,"Mariana had no choice but to look at the minister of justice. He was bravely enduring a speech by a government supporter, in which the speaker was extolling the merits of the criminal justice system and, along the way, painstakingly summarizing all the old colonial legislation on the subject. There were no interruptions; just a polite, resigned, cautious silence. Mariana’s eyes drifted from one side to the other, utterly bored; Sofia was constantly saying things to her, as an excuse for making all kinds of elegant gestures. After fifteen minutes, the Chamber stirred into life, thanks to a remark made by the speaker and an objection from the opposition. Heckles were exchanged, the temperature rose, and there ensued an uproar that lasted nearly a quarter of an hour.",CO120CL10
5212,98,"Mariana did not find this diversion in the least diverting; indeed, her placid, equable nature was thrown into a spin by such unexpected commotion. She even got up to leave, then sat down again. She was ready now to stay until the end, repentant and resolved to keep her marital woes to herself. Doubts began to creep in.",CO120CL10
5213,99,"She had been right to ask her husband to change his hat, but was it worth all this heartache? Was it reasonable to make such a fuss? He had been cruel and sarcastic, but it was, after all, the first time she had put her foot down and, naturally, the novelty had irritated him. At any rate, it had been a mistake to spill the beans to her friend. Sofia might go and tell others . . .",CO120CL10
5214,100,"The thought sent a chill down Mariana’s spine; her friend’s indiscretion was assured; she herself had heard Sofia tell many tales about hats, male and female, engaged in much more than a simple marital tiff. Mariana felt the need to flatter her, and covered up her impatience and annoyance with a mask of hypocritical docility. She, too, began to smile and make random observations about this or that deputy, and in this uneasy truce they reached the end of the speech and the session.",CO120CL10
5215,101,"It was gone four o’clock. “Time for home,” said Sofia. Mariana agreed, although she seemed in no hurry, and they made their way back along Rua do Ouvidor. Walking up the street and catching the streetcar completed Mariana’s mental exhaustion, and she only began to breathe more easily when she saw that she really was on her way home. Shortly before Sofia got off, Mariana asked her keep to herself what she had told her, and Sofia promised that she would.",CO120CL10
5216,102,"Mariana gave a sigh of relief. The dove was free of the hawk. Her soul was aching from all the pushing and shoving, dizzy from all those disparate people and things. What she needed was equilibrium and peace. She was nearly home; as she watched the neighboring houses and gardens pass by, Mariana felt her spirits lift. At last she arrived; she entered the garden, and took a deep breath. This was her world, except for a flowerpot that the gardener had moved.",CO120CL10
5217,103,"“João, put that flowerpot back where it was,” she said.",CO120CL10
5218,104,"Everything else was in order, the entrance hall, the drawing room, the dining room, the bedrooms, everything. First of all, Mariana sat down, in various different places, looking carefully at all the objects, so still and orderly. After a whole day of swirling variety, the monotony restored her peace of mind, and had never before seemed so delightful. The truth was she’d made a mistake.",CO120CL10
5219,105,"She tried to relive the day’s events, but couldn’t; her soul was gently slipping back into its home comforts. At most, she thought about Viçoso, whom she now, rather unfairly, thought ridiculous. She undressed slowly and lovingly, precisely removing and putting away each item of clothing. Once she was undressed, she thought again about the quarrel with her husband. All things considered, she realized that it had been mainly her fault. Why such stubbornness over a hat that her husband had been wearing for years? And, besides, her father was a terrible fusspot.",CO120CL10
5220,106,"“I’ll wait and see the look on his face when he comes home,” she thought.",CO120CL10
5221,107,"It was half-past five; he wouldn’t be long. Mariana went to the front room, peered out the window, listened for the streetcar, but heard nothing. She sat down by the window with Ivanhoe in her hands, trying, and failing, to read. Her eyes skimmed to the end of the page, then back to the beginning; firstly, because she couldn’t grasp the meaning, and secondly, because time and again her eyes would wander from the page to admire the perfect folds of the curtains or some other feature of the room. Ah, blessèd monotony, cradling her in thy eternal bosom.",CO120CL10
5222,108,"Eventually the streetcar stopped outside the house and her husband got off; the garden gate creaked open. Mariana went to the window and peered out. Conrado was walking slowly up the garden path, looking to left and right, his hat on his head—not the famous hat he always wore, but another one, the one his wife had asked him to wear that very morning. It came as a rude shock to Mariana, just like the flowerpot in the garden being moved, or as if she’d come across a page of Voltaire in her copy of Moreninha or Ivanhoe.",CO120CL10
5223,109,"It was a jarring note in the harmonious sonata of life. No, that hat would never do. Really, whatever had possessed her to make him get rid of the old one that suited him so well? Even if it wasn’t perhaps the most appropriate of hats, it had served him for many years, and framed his face so well . . . Conrado came in through a side door. Mariana flung her arms around him.",CO120CL10
5224,110,"“So, is it over?” he asked, circling her waist.",CO120CL10
5225,111,"“Listen, darling,” she replied, giving him the divinest of kisses, “throw that hat away; the other one’s much nicer.”",CO120CL10

5232,7,"Muse, sing of the annoyance of Mariana, wife of the right honorable Conrado Seabra, on that April morning in 1879. What was the cause of all the fuss? Just a hat! Lightweight, rather natty, not an elegant, top hat …",CO120CL06
5233,8,"Conrado, a lawyer with an office on Quitanda Street, wore it every day on his way downtown and to court hearings, as well. He only didn’t wear it to formal receptions, the opera, funerals, and other such ceremonious occasions. Otherwise, he had worn it constantly for the last five or six years, the entire length of his marriage. Then, on that particular April morning, having finished his breakfast, Conrado began to roll himself a cigarette, and Mariana announced with a smile that she had a small request.",CO120CL06
5234,9,"“What is it, my angel?”",CO120CL06
5235,10,"“Could you do something for me, make a sacrifice on my behalf?”",CO120CL06
5236,11,“One sacrifice? Why … ten or twenty!”,CO120CL06
5237,12,“Then don’t wear that hat anymore to go downtown.”,CO120CL06
5238,13,“Why? Is it hideous?”,CO120CL06
5239,14,"“I’m not saying it’s hideous. It’s a hat for around the neighborhood, a hat to wear in the afternoon or at night. But downtown? For a lawyer? I can’t see it.”",CO120CL06
5240,15,"“That’s just silly, dear.”",CO120CL06
5241,16,"“Okay, but will you do it as a favor to me?”",CO120CL06
5242,17,"Conrado struck a match, lit his cigarette, and made a humorous gesture, preparing to change the subject. But his wife insisted, and her insistence, which had been gentle and imploring, turned suddenly rough and imperious. Conrado was shocked. He knew his wife, who was ordinarily a passive creature, soft and tender, of great plasticity. She could wear a royal diadem or a common scarf with the same, blissful indifference.",CO120CL06
5243,18,"The proof was that, after her footloose and fancy-free last two unmarried years, the wedding had made her a homebody. She rarely went out, did so only at the urging of her consort, and always seemed happiest at home. Curtains, furnishings, and beautiful objects made up for the absence of children; she loved them like a mother. To see the curtains creased just so, each piece of furniture in its place, produced visceral pleasure in Mariana.",CO120CL06
5244,19,"Of the three windows that looked onto the street, for example, one was always precisely half open, and always the same one. Not even her husband’s study escaped her need for reliable regularity. If he happened to straighten his books, she might intervene to restore disorder. Her mental habits displayed the same monotonous uniformity.",CO120CL06
5245,20,"Mariana read the same books over and over, all standard fare for a proper young Brazilian lady: Joaquim Macedo’s Moreninha, seven times; Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, ten times; Madame Craven’s Mot de l’énigme, eleven times.1",CO120CL06
5246,21,"In other words, how to explain her sudden desire to change his hat? The night before, while her husband attended a meeting of the bar association, Mariana’s father had visited his daughter. He was a good old man, lean and slow moving, a retired career bureaucrat nostalgic for the days when government offices were full of men in long tailcoats.",CO120CL06
5247,22,"A tailcoat was what he still wore to funerals decades later, and not, as one might expect, because of the solemnity of death or the gravity of the last farewell, but simply because he had the habit of doing so. He gave the same reason for dining daily at two o’clock in the afternoon and for twenty other precisely repeated customs. He was so rigid about his habits that he dined at two even on his daughter’s wedding anniversary, when, every year, he was invited to a six-o’clock dinner at her house. He sat at her table, on those days, and watched everyone else eat, although afterward he did usually accept a bite of dessert, a glass of wine, and some coffee.",CO120CL06
5248,23,"That was Conrado’s father-in-law. How, indeed, could he approve of his son-in-law’s failure to wear a top hat downtown? He couldn’t; he endured the natty little hat silently, at best, in recognition of Conrado’s fine qualities. He endured it until he happened to see it one day, on a downtown street, conversing with the elegant top hats of several distinguished gentlemen, and he found it disgraceful. That evening, going to Mariana’s house and finding his son-in-law out, he opened his heart. The little hat was an abomination, and it must be banished forever.",CO120CL06
5249,24,"Conrado did not know about these origins of the request. In view of his wife’s well-known docility and his own authoritarian inclinations, he couldn’t understand her stubbornness, and it annoyed him profoundly. He contained himself, even so, preferring to make fun of her request. He spoke with such irony and disdain that the poor woman felt humiliated. Twice, Mariana tried to rise from the table, so Conrado held her there, the first time with a light grip around her wrist, the second time with his domineering gaze. And with a smile, he said:",CO120CL06
5250,25,"“Look, dear, I have a philosophical reason not to do what you ask. I’ve never told you about this, and now I’m going to confide in you totally.”",CO120CL06
5251,26,"Mariana bit her lip and said nothing more. She picked up a table knife and began idly to tap the table, just to do something, but her husband did not permit even that. Gently, he took the knife from her hand and continued:",CO120CL06
5252,27,"“Choosing a hat is not as random a thing as you may suppose. To the contrary, the choice is governed by metaphysical principles. He who chooses a hat does not exercise his free will. An obscure determinism is at work. Hat buyers cherish the illusion of free will, and hat sellers who watch a customer try on thirty or forty hats without buying any likewise imagine free will to be at work. But, no, there is a metaphysical principle involved:",CO120CL06
5253,28,"The hat completes the man; it is an extension of his being, decreed for all eternity. Changing a hat is an act of mutilation. Oddly, this principle has so far remained unremarked. Wise men have studied everything from the stars to earthworms—Laplace with his Mécanique Céleste, for example, or Darwin with his book On the Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms—you haven’t read Laplace?",CO120CL06
5254,29,"And yet no one has thought to examine a hat exhaustively from all angles. No one has noticed the metaphysics of hats. I may write a study of the matter myself. Now, though, it’s a quarter to ten o’clock. You can reflect on what I’ve said. Who knows? It may be, in fact, that the man completes the hat, rather than vice versa …”",CO120CL06
5255,30,"Mariana finally managed to get up and leave the table. She had understood nothing but his sarcastic tone, and inside she was weeping with humiliation. Her husband went upstairs to dress and came back down a few minutes later to stand in front of her with the famous hat on his head. Mariana found it disgraceful, just as her father had said, vulgar and disgraceful. Conrado took his leave with considerable ceremony and went out.",CO120CL06
5256,31,"The lady’s irritation had lessened somewhat, but the taste of humiliation remained in her mouth. Mariana did not clamor and cry as she had expected to do, however. She reviewed the situation to herself, remembering Conrado’s sarcasm and the simplicity of her request, which might be a little demanding, she recognized, but which hardly justified such rude behavior. She paced back and forth restlessly. She went into the front room and looked from the half-opened window at her husband standing on the street below, waiting for the streetcar, his back to the house, the eternal, disgraceful little hat on his head.",CO120CL06
5257,32,"Mariana was overcome by hatred of the ridiculous little thing. How had she stood it for so many years? She considered all those years, how docile she had been, consenting always to her husband’s desires and whims, and she asked herself if that weren’t precisely the cause of his behavior that morning.",CO120CL06
5258,33,"She was a patsy, a pushover. If she had done the same as countless other wives—Clara and Sophia, for example—who treated their husbands as husbands should be treated … well, she would not have suffered the man’s sarcasm that morning, not by half. One thought led to another, and she decided to go out. She dressed and went to visit Sophia, a friend from school, just for a breath of fresh air, not intending to tell her anything.",CO120CL06
5259,34,"Sophia was thirty, two years older than Mariana. She was tall, strong, and very self-possessed. She received her friend with the usual fuss, and in view of the other’s silence, easily guessed that something was wrong. Goodbye to Mariana’s resolve to say nothing. At the end of twenty minutes, she had aired the entire matter. Sophia laughed and shook her by the shoulders. She told her that it wasn’t her husband’s fault.",CO120CL06
5260,35,"“Oh, it’s my fault,” agreed Mariana.",CO120CL06
5261,36,"“Don’t be a patsy, dear. You’ve been too soft with him. Be strong for once. Don’t pay any attention to his little fit. Give him the silent treatment, and when he tries to make up with you, tell him to lose the hat first.”",CO120CL06
5262,37,“Such a trivial thing …”,CO120CL06
5263,38,"“Give him your little finger and he’ll take your whole hand, dear. Of course, he will. They all do it. Look at that ninny Beatriz. Didn’t she let her husband pack her off to their estate in the country because he noticed an Englishman riding by their house every afternoon, hoping to see her at the window? Poor Englishman! Why pick a fight over him? I’ll bet he didn’t even notice she was gone! One can live happily with one’s husband, with mutual respect, I do believe, without fighting or despotism.",CO120CL06
5264,39,"I get along very well with my Ricardo, very harmoniously. He does whatever I ask immediately, even if he doesn’t want to. One frown from me, and he obeys immediately. He wouldn’t give me trouble over a mere hat, that’s certain, no way in the world. Don’t even think about it, I’d say, and he’d get a new one, like it or not.”",CO120CL06
5265,40,"Mariana listened enviously to her friend’s fine description of conjugal bliss. With the trumpets of Eve’s rebellion against Adam sounding in the background, Sophia’s example gave her an itch for independence, a wish to exercise her will. To complete the situation, although Sophia was self-possessed, one could say, others aspired to possess her, as well.",CO120CL06
5266,41,"She had eyes especially for all English aspirants, whether on horseback or afoot. She was an honest woman, but a flirt; it’s a rude term, but there’s no time to invent a more delicate one. Sophia flirted left and right. It was her nature, and she had done so out of habit since girlhood. What she gave out to all the poor fellows who knocked at her door was the small change of love: a nickel here, a nickel there, never a five-milréis bill, much less larger denominations.",CO120CL06
5267,42,"On the day in question, Sophia’s charitable urges led her to propose a stroll downtown to visit a few shops and, who knows, look at a few hats. Mariana accepted the proposal. A little demon inside her was huffing and puffing at the fires of vengeance. In addition, her friend, who held a certain fascination for Mariana, did not give her time to think. She accepted; why not? She was sick and tired of being shut in, she wanted to live a little.",CO120CL06
5268,43,"Sophia went to dress while Mariana stayed in the sitting room, restless and pleased with herself. She thought of the coming week and scheduled her activities day by day, hour by hour. She stood up, sat down, stood up, and went to the window, waiting impatiently.",CO120CL06
5269,44,“Is Sophia sewing a new dress?” she asked herself from time to time.,CO120CL06
5270,45,"During one of her trips to the window she saw a young man pass on horseback. He wasn’t English, but he reminded her of Beatriz, whose husband had packed her off to the country to escape an Englishman, and Mariana felt a growing hatred of all men—except, possibly, for young men on horseback.",CO120CL06
5271,46,"This one was too full of himself, however. He stuck his legs out in the stirrups to show off his boots, and he rode with his hand on his waist like a fashion figurine. Still, his hat compensated for those two defects. It was a little hat, but it went well with his riding costume. It wasn’t on the head of a lawyer on his way to the office.",CO120CL06
5272,47,"She heard her friend’s heels slowly descending the stairs. “Ready,” said Sophia, coming into the room. She really was pretty: tall, as we already know, with a splendid hat and a devilish black silk dress that showed off the swell of her bust. Beside her friend, the figure of Mariana disappeared somewhat. Looking at her carefully, one could see that Mariana had beautiful eyes, attractive features, and a lot of natural elegance.",CO120CL06
5273,48,"But glancing at the two women together, all one saw was Sophia. Sophia was conscious of her superiority, I should add, and for that very reason she chose friends like Mariana. If that is a character flaw, it’s not my job to disguise it.",CO120CL06
5274,49,“Where shall we go?” asked Mariana.,CO120CL06
5275,50,"“What a question! We’re going for a stroll downtown … Let’s see. I need to get my picture taken. Then I need to go by the dentist’s office. No, we’ll go by the dentist’s office first. Do you need to see the dentist?”",CO120CL06
5276,51,“No.”,CO120CL06
5277,52,“Or to have your picture taken?”,CO120CL06
5278,53,"“I’ve got lots of pictures. And what for, anyway? To give to What’s-his-name?”",CO120CL06
5279,54,"Sophia could tell that her friend was still smoldering, and on the way downtown she did her best to stoke the flames. Although it wouldn’t be easy, Mariana could still throw off the yoke of tyranny, and Sophia could teach her how. The best way was slowly but surely, without dramatic gestures to alert her adversary. Let him not realize his fate until he felt her boot on his neck. Three or four weeks is all it would take. Sophia was willing to help, and she told Mariana again to be strong for once. She wasn’t anybody’s slave, and so on. The trumpets sounded again in Mariana’s heart.",CO120CL06
5280,55,"They got to Ouvidor Street just past noon. People, a lot of people, stood around or strolled along, the usual crowd. Mariana found it a little overwhelming, as always. The hurly burly clashed with her placid and even temperament. She found it hard to walk, and even harder to rest her gaze amid the milling crowd and the profusion of shops. She shrank against her friend and, not realizing that they had already passed the dentist’s office, she hoped that they would arrive there soon. She wanted to go inside and get away from the tumult.",CO120CL06
5281,56,"“Ouvidor Street,” she said, shaking her head.",CO120CL06
5282,57,"“Really?” responded Sophia, turning her head toward her friend, but looking past her at a young man across the street.",CO120CL06
5283,58,"Sophia navigated these choppy waters with the skill of a practiced mariner, calmly slipping through or around the groups of oncoming pedestrians, and she made a powerful impression on them. Those who knew her smiled, and those who didn’t stopped or turned to admire her style. And, full of the spirit of charity, the good woman flashed her eyes in all directions while pretending to converse with Mariana. She skipped from topic to topic, and seemed not hear her friend’s replies, as she pointed out this or that woman of their acquaintance, this or that shop, and especially, this or that hat. Hats, both men’s and women’s hats, were everywhere in the midday sun.",CO120CL06
5284,59,"“Look at that one,” said Sophia.",CO120CL06
5285,60,"And Mariana tried to follow her gaze but often couldn’t see which hat she meant. Ouvidor Street was a dizzying kaleidoscope of hats. Where was the dentist’s office? She had to ask twice before Sophia answered that they’d already passed it. Now it was best to continue to the end of the street, turn around, and stop at the dentist’s on the way back. Finally, they arrived.",CO120CL06
5286,61,"“Uff … ,” sighed Mariana, with evident relief, when they entered the hallway.",CO120CL06
5287,62,"“What’s the problem? Good Lord, it’s as though you’d never been to town!”",CO120CL06
5288,63,"A few women were already waiting to see the dentist. Mariana could find no familiar faces among them, and to avoid looking at strangers, she went to the window. At least from there she could watch the street without getting trampled. She leaned against the windowsill. Sophia went to talk with her. On the sidewalk outside, a few men’s hats turned in their direction, first hats that were standing there conversing, then hats that were passing by … Mariana objected to their persistent looks, but then she noticed that the looks were directed principally at her friend, and her objection dissolved into a kind of envy.",CO120CL06
5289,64,"Meanwhile, Sophia told her the adventures of certain hats. One hat was all that their friend So-and-So could think about. Another was madly in love with a different So-and-So, and she with him, as one could observe every Wednesday and Saturday between the hours of two and three o’clock, right there on Ouvidor Street. Mariana listened in bewilderment. The hat was nice looking, she had to admit, and so was the tie, rather devil-may-care, but …",CO120CL06
5290,65,"“I can’t swear to it,” her friend went on, “but that’s what they say.”",CO120CL06
5291,66,"Mariana looked pensively at the hat in question. Now three more, equally gallant, hats joined it, and probably all four were speaking, in complimentary terms, about them. Mariana blushed, turned her head to one side, quickly turned it back, and finally left the window. Turning around, she found two newly arrived patients, and, escorting them, a young man who rose quickly and came to greet her effusively. It was the man who had been her first suitor.",CO120CL06
5292,67,"The first suitor must have been about thirty-three by now. He’d been away from Rio for years, running his family’s plantation, touring Europe, and, most recently, governing a province in the far south by prestigious imperial appointment. He was of medium height and rather pale, with a sparse beard, and his clothes were close fitting. In his hand was a new hat, an elegant top hat, grave, gubernatorial, administrative, a hat suitable to the person and his ambitions.",CO120CL06
5293,68,"Mariana, meanwhile, could hardly look at him. So confused did she become, so disoriented by the presence of a man whom she’d known in very special circumstances and whom she hadn’t seen since 1877, that she failed to discern anything. She extended her hand (more precisely, her fingertips), apparently murmured some kind of response to him, and was about to go back to the window, when Sophia appeared beside her.",CO120CL06
5294,69,"Sophia, too, knew the former suitor. They exchanged a few words. Mariana whispered impatiently in her friend’s ear. Wouldn’t it be better to come back another day? But her friend said that, no, it would only take half an hour, three quarters at most. For Mariana, the situation was oppressive. The presence of that man obfuscated her senses, threw her into a state of struggle and confusion.",CO120CL06
5295,70,"All her husband’s fault. If only he hadn’t been so pigheaded and then added insult to injury, nothing would have happened! The thought made her promise herself that she’d get retribution. She thought about her house, so pretty, so nice and peaceful, where she could be right now, safe and sound, without all these people around, without having to depend on her friend …",CO120CL06
5296,71,"“Mariana,” said her friend, “Dr. Viçoso is insisting that he’s lost weight. Don’t you think he looks the same as last year? Do you remember seeing him last year?”",CO120CL06
5297,72,"Dr. Viçoso was the proper name of her former suitor, who was now chatting to Sophia, though with frequent looks at Mariana. Mariana responded that, no, she didn’t remember. Viçoso took the opening to engage her in conversation. It really had been a few years since he’d seen her, and he underlined that observation with a certain sad, profound look. Then he opened his bag of conversational gambits and pulled out the opera. What did they think of the current offerings?",CO120CL06
5298,73,"In his opinion the opera company was excellent, except for the rather lame baritone. Sophia protested his harsh judgment of the baritone, but he insisted, adding that, in London, where he’d seen this company before, he’d gotten the same impression. The female leads, yes, indeed, both the soprano and the contralto, were first class. And he discussed their repertory, mentioned the finest passages of various operas, and praised the orchestra, most especially their rendition of Meyerbeer’s Les Huguenots2 … He’d seen Mariana there at the last performance, in the fourth or fifth box on the left, wasn’t that right?",CO120CL06
5299,74,"“We were there,” she murmured, accentuating the plural.",CO120CL06
5300,75,"“At the Cassino … that’s where I haven’t seen you,” he continued.",CO120CL06
5301,76,"“She’s becoming a recluse,” joined in Sophia, laughing.",CO120CL06
5302,77,"Viçoso had much enjoyed the recent dance at the Cassino; he brought out all his impressions, and Sophia did the same. The loveliest and most elaborate dresses of the evening were discussed by each of them in detail. Next came various personalities, an ill temper or two, and a few harmless, witty remarks, though not at the expense of anyone who couldn’t afford it. Mariana listened without interest. Once or twice she even got up and went to the window, but the hats were so numerous and so curious that she sat back down. Silently, she called her friend some ugly names that I won’t write here. It isn’t necessary and, besides, it would be in poor taste to reveal what one young lady might think about another young lady during a moment of irritation.",CO120CL06
5303,78,“What about the races at the Jockey Club?” inquired the former provincial governor by prestigious imperial appointment.,CO120CL06
5304,79,"Mariana shook her head again. She hadn’t gone this year. Well, she had really missed it, because the races were excellent, the next to last one, especially. The horses were first class. The Epsom races, which he had seen in England, had nothing on the next to last heat of the season at Rio’s Jockey Club.",CO120CL06
5305,80,"And Sophia had to agree. She confessed that she had enjoyed herself immensely. The conversation then toured two concerts of the coming week before going up to Petrópolis to enjoy the hospitality of a couple of diplomats, friends of Dr. Viçoso. When the wife of an imperial minister dropped in, Sophia said something charming about how the former governor, too, ought to think about marrying, for certainly he would soon be a minister, himself.",CO120CL06
5306,81,"Viçoso shuddered ever so slightly with pleasure, and he smiled, shaking his head, no, no. Then, with his eyes on Mariana, he confessed that he probably never would marry … Mariana blushed deeply and stood up.",CO120CL06
5307,82,"“I see that you’re in a hurry,” said Sophia, and then, turning back toward Viçoso: “What time is it?”",CO120CL06
5308,83,“Almost three o’clock!” he exclaimed.,CO120CL06
5309,84,"It was late. He had to go to the Chamber of Deputies. He went to speak to the two ladies with whom he had arrived, his cousins, and said goodbye to them, then returned to take his leave of our friends, but Sophia declared that she, too, was on her way out. She had waited long enough. The truth is that a visit to the Chamber of Deputies sounded intriguing.",CO120CL06
5310,85,“Shall we drop by?” she proposed to Mariana.,CO120CL06
5311,86,"“No, no,” said Mariana. “I can’t. I’m very tired.”",CO120CL06
5312,87,"“Let’s do, just for a little while. I’m tired, too …”",CO120CL06
5313,88,"Mariana resisted a moment longer, but her arguing with Sophia—a dove arguing with a hawk—was completely pointless. There was no way around it: she went. Ouvidor Street was thronged now, with both sidewalks full of people coming and going and getting in each others’ way at the intersections. The gallant former governor strode between the two ladies, having offered to find them a place to sit in the Chamber of Deputies.",CO120CL06
5314,89,"The hubbub outside lacerated Mariana’s spirit more and more. Her resentment, the energy that had launched her audacious flight that morning, had dwindled now, or even vanished. She thought again about her house, so quiet and peaceful, with a place for everything and everything in its place. Never any jostling, nothing unexpected. Mariana’s spirit began to tap its foot with impatience. She no longer heard anything that Viçoso was saying, even though he spoke loudly and directed many of his comments to her.",CO120CL06
5315,90,"She no longer heard or cared to hear. She only prayed to God for the time to pass quickly. They entered the Chamber of Deputies and found a seat. The sound of the arriving ladies’ skirts attracted the attention of the few deputies who remained in the chamber, about twenty of them, listening to a speech on budgetary matters. As soon as Viçoso excused himself and left them alone, Mariana told her friend not to do it again.",CO120CL06
5316,91,“Don’t do what again?” asked Sophia.,CO120CL06
5317,92,“Don’t drag me all over creation on a fool’s errand. What on earth are we doing in the Chamber of Deputies? What do I care about speeches that I can’t understand?”,CO120CL06
5318,93,"Sophia smiled, fluttered her fan, and sensed the gaze of a man—not a deputy, but rather, one of the secretaries—who was examining her. Many eyes examined her during her visits to the Chamber of Deputies, but those of this secretary had a particularly warm and imploring expression. We can understand, then, that she didn’t meet his gaze at first. We can even understand that, full of curiosity, she did meet it before long. And, bathed in the legislative gaze, Sophia replied gently to her friend, recognizing her error, saying that she’d meant well. She was only trying to restore Mariana’s self-respect.",CO120CL06
5319,94,"“But if you think I’m not being nice to you,” concluded Sophia, “then stay home, by all means.”",CO120CL06
5320,95,"And leaning over slightly, she added:",CO120CL06
5321,96,"“Look, there’s the minister of justice.”",CO120CL06
5322,97,"Mariana had no alternative but to look at the minister of justice, who was enduring the endless speech of one of his supporters. The orator droned on concerning a fine point of judicial reform that offered an opportunity to display his knowledge of ancient Portuguese legislation on the subject. The speech produced no reaction among the listeners, only a polite, resigned, discreet, and cautious silence. Mariana sat in boredom, her eyes roaming around the chamber. Sophia made frequent comments occasioned by her desire to show off her hand gestures. After fifteen minutes, one of the orator’s remarks finally provoked some diversion: a response from the floor, followed by a spirited discussion.",CO120CL06
5323,98,"The diversion did not suit the placid spirit of Mariana, who found it agitating and even stood up to leave. She thought better and sat down again, resolved to stay until the end and, in the future, bear her conjugal woes without sharing them with anyone. She was not so certain, anymore, about her own reactions.",CO120CL06
5324,99,"Her request to her husband had been reasonable, surely, but was it really worth such a fuss? His sarcasm had been cruel, but she’d never before put her foot down so firmly, so naturally he was surprised and irritated. At any rate, it had been a big mistake to reveal everything to Sophia, who might tell their friends …",CO120CL06
5325,100,"The idea sent a chill down Mariana’s spine. Sophia’s indiscretion was inevitable. Hadn’t she blabbed all about certain masculine and feminine hats engaged in much more than a simple marital tiff? Mariana had the impulse not to antagonize her friend, and she instantly concealed her impatience and annoyance behind a mask of false docility. She began to smile as cheerfully as Sophia and to make random comments regarding this or that deputy, and, soon enough, the speech had concluded, and with it, the day’s legislative session.",CO120CL06
5326,101,"The clocks struck four. “Time to go home,” said Sophia. Mariana agreed that it was, but without showing signs of impatience, and the two women walked up Ouvidor to take the streetcar together. The walk, and getting onto the car, completed the spiritual exhaustion of Mariana, who started to breathe easier as soon as the vehicle began to roll. Just before Sophia got off, Mariana asked her not to repeat anything she’d told her, and Sophia promised that she wouldn’t.",CO120CL06
5327,102,"Mariana took a deep breath. The dove had escaped from the hawk. Her spirit had been battered and dizzied by so many different sights and sounds, people and things. She needed equilibrium and quiet surroundings. Her house wasn’t far away now. When the neighboring houses and gardens came into view, Mariana’s spirit was restored at last. She got off at her own house, opened the garden gate, and relaxed. She was back in her world, except for a flowerpot that the gardener had moved.",CO120CL06
5328,103,"“João,” she said to him, “put that where it was before.”",CO120CL06
5329,104,"Everything else was in order: the entry hall, the sitting room, the dining room, the bedrooms, everything. Mariana sat down in various rooms to take a good look at her things, so neat and still. After a day of swirling variety, the monotony of her house was a soothing balm, something that she had always enjoyed, but never so much as just then. The truth was that she’d made a mistake …",CO120CL06
5330,105,"She tried to review the events of the morning, and she couldn’t think, so relaxed did she feel in her own house, and so tired. At most, she thought a little (and a little unjustly) about Viçoso, who seemed a ridiculous figure to her now. She went to her room and undressed slowly, lovingly, methodically. Once in her dressing gown, she thought about the fight with her husband, and, on careful reconsideration, decided that the fight was mostly her fault. Her father always wanted to boss her around, and she shouldn’t let him. Why make a big thing over a hat that Conrado had worn for years?",CO120CL06
5331,106,"“I’ll wait and see how he acts when he comes home,” she said to herself.",CO120CL06
5332,107,"It was half past five o’clock; he would be home soon.  Mariana went into the front room, peered through the glass into the street, listened for the streetcar, and nothing. She sat down by the window and opened Ivanhoe, trying to read, and not reading anything. Her eyes reached the bottom of the page then returned to the beginning because she had understood nothing, because her mind wandered, along with her eyes, to savor the perfection of the curtains or some similar detail of her house. Blessed monotony, thou tookest her to thy eternal bosom.",CO120CL06
5333,108,"At last, a streetcar stopped, her husband climbed down from it, and Mariana heard the squeak of the garden’s iron gate. She went to the window and peered out. Conrado was coming through the gate slowly, looking up and down the street, with his hat on his head—not the little hat that had caused all the trouble, but rather, a different one, just as his wife had requested that morning. Mariana’s spirit received a rude shock, similar to the one caused by the out-of-place flowerpot, something like the shock that a page of Voltaire would cause if encountered in the middle of Moreninha or Ivanhoe.",CO120CL06
5334,109,"It was a dissonant note amid the harmonious sonata of life. No, that hat would never do. What on earth had she been thinking when she told him not to wear the old one that suited him so well? Even if it wasn’t the most appropriate hat, it was the hat her husband had worn for years, the hat that fit his face.",CO120CL06
5335,110,Conrado opened the door and entered. Mariana greeted him with a hug.,CO120CL06

5340,4,"I really didn’t, and even couldn’t reply to those letters, in which your solicitude showed two feelings: the friend’s affection and the woman’s curiosity. It wasn’t adequate to open my heart to you or unravel the reasons that motivated me to leave the court2, where the operas at Theatro Lyrico, the matches in Campesina3 and the familiar evening meetings at cousin Barroso’s house might distract me from my recent widowhood.",CO006CL09

5414,78,I wanted to reinforce the divine help by deciding not to go to the theater for some time.,CO006CL09

5418,82,"It was strange. The letter had no address. It was glued and seemed to wait to be opened by the person to whom it was addressed. Who would it be? Would it be my husband? As I was used to opening all the letters that were sent to him, I didn’t hesitate. I opened the envelope and uncovered the pink paper inside.",CO006CL09
5419,83,The letter said:,CO006CL09
5420,84,"Don’t be surprised, Eugênia; this is a desperate way, and desperation comes from love. I love you so much. For some time I sought to run away from you and smother this feeling; I can’t do it anymore. Didn’t you see me at the Theatro Lyrico? An occult and interior force took me there. I haven’t seen you since then. When will I see you again? I’ll be patient if I don’t see you; but the idea of your heart beating because of me for one minute each day is what satisfies a love that doesn’t look for the ventures of joy, or for public celebrations. Forgive me if I offend you. If you can love me, turn me into a God.",CO006CL09
5421,85,I read this letter with trembling hands and clouded eyes; some minutes later I still didn’t know what would happen to me.,CO006CL09
5422,86,A thousand ideas crossed and confused my mind like black birds in the sky when a storm is coming.,CO006CL09
5423,87,Would love be guiding the hand of that mysterious man? Would that be a strategy from a calculating seducer? I looked around vaguely and feared my husband’s arrival.,CO006CL09
5424,88,The paper was in front of me and the mysterious letters seemed to be the eyes of an infernal serpent. With an involuntary and nervous movement I crumpled the letter with my hands.,CO006CL09
5425,89,"Sin wouldn’t have existed if Eve had done the same with the head of the serpent that tempted her. I couldn’t be sure of the same result because other heads might sprout from the serpent, like the Hydra of Lerna8, that appeared here and whose head I squashed.",CO006CL09
5426,90,"Never mind that I made this double evocation, biblical and pagan. At that moment, I didn’t reflect on anything, just hallucinated. Only afterwards was I able to link the two ideas.",CO006CL09
5427,91,"Two feelings were revolving inside of me: the first was a kind of terror that infused the abyss, the deep abyss that I sensed coming from that letter. The second was a bitter shame when I noticed that the mysterious man’s consideration of me wasn’t very high, as it couldn’t stop him from using this means.",CO006CL09
5428,92,I could only reflect what I should have reflected in the beginning when my spirit calmed down. Who would put the letter there? My first attitude was to call all my servants. But the idea that no information could be obtained from a simple interrogation and also the idea of disclosing the finding of the letter made me control myself. Was that worth it?,CO006CL09
5429,93,I didn’t call anybody.,CO006CL09
5430,94,"However, I said to myself, the enterprise was bold and could fail at any step. What compelled that man to behave that way? Would it be love or seduction?",CO006CL09
5431,95,"Returning to this dilemma, my spirit, despite the dangers, leaned toward accepting the first hypothesis, which was the one that respected my consideration of a married woman and my vanity as a beautiful young lady.",CO006CL09
5432,96,"I wanted to guess by reading the letter again. I read it not only one, but two, three, five times.",CO006CL09
5433,97,"An indiscreet curiosity tied me to that paper. I made an effort and decided to destroy it, objecting that in the second case no slaves or servants would continue to be in my house.",CO006CL09
5434,98,"I crossed the room with the paper in my hand, went to my office, where I lighted a candle and burned the letter, which burned my hands and my head.",CO006CL09
5435,99,"When the last spark of paper turned black and lifted away, I felt someone walking behind me. It was my husband.",CO006CL09
5436,100,My spontaneous movement was to throw myself in his arms.,CO006CL09
5437,101,He hugged me with a certain amazement.,CO006CL09
5438,102,And when my hug became longer I felt he put me off softly by saying:,CO006CL09
5439,103,"“That’s enough, you’re suffocating me!”",CO006CL09
5440,104,I pulled away.,CO006CL09
5441,105,"I was sad to see that man, who could and should protect and save me, not understand, at least by instinct, that holding him so tightly was as if I were holding the idea of duty.",CO006CL09
5442,106,"But the feeling that tightened my heart for a moment was replaced by fear. The letter’s ashes were on the floor, and the candle was still burning even though it was day; all this was enough for an interrogation. Not even curiosity stimulated him to do that!",CO006CL09
5443,107,He took two steps in the office and left.,CO006CL09
5444,108,I felt a tear rolling down my face. It wasn’t the first tear of bitterness. Would it be the first warning of sin?,CO006CL09
5445,109,III,CO006CL09
5446,110,A month went by.,CO006CL09
5447,111,"There weren’t any changes at home during this time. Letters appeared no more, and my extreme vigilance became useless.",CO006CL09
5448,112,"I couldn’t forget the incident of the letter. If it were only that! Its first words came back incessantly to my memory; afterwards, the others, and others, all of them. I knew the letter by heart!",CO006CL09
5449,113,"Do you remember? One of my greatest vanities was having a good memory. So, I was punished with this gift. Those words tortured me and burned my head. Why? Oh! Carlota! The problem was that I found an indefinable enchantment in those words, a painful enchantment accompanied by remorse, and I couldn’t get rid of it.",CO006CL09
5450,114,The effort didn’t come from the heart but from the imagination. I was lost in imagination; the fight between duty and imagination is cruel and dangerous for weak spirits. I was weak. Mystery fascinated my fantasy.,CO006CL09
5451,115,"After all, days and fun could turn my spirit away from that obsessive thought. If I hadn’t completely forgotten the mysterious man and his letter after one month, I was, however, calm enough to laugh at myself and at my fears.",CO006CL09
5452,116,"On a Thursday evening, there were some people in my house, and many of my friends except you. My husband hadn’t returned home, and his absence wasn’t felt or noticed because, in spite of being a good gentleman, he didn’t have the particular gift of a true host for such meetings.",CO006CL09
5453,117,"People sang, played music, and talked; the most sincere and expansive happiness reigned among everyone.

5454,118,My husband was announced.,CO006CL09
5455,119,"He didn’t come alone. Beside him, there was a tall, elegant and slim man. I didn’t know him. My husband took the lead and introduced the man to me in the middle of the general silence.",CO006CL09
5456,120,I heard from my husband that our guest was named Emílio.,CO006CL09
5457,121,I fixed my eyes on him and held back a scream.,CO006CL09
5458,122,It was him!,CO006CL09
5459,123,"My scream was replaced by a gesture of surprise. Nobody noticed it. He seemed to notice less than anyone. His eyes were fixed on me, and with a gracious gesture he said some words filled with flattering courtesy.",CO006CL09
5460,124,I answered the way I could.,CO006CL09
5461,125,"All the introductions were made, and for ten minutes everybody was bashful.",CO006CL09
5462,126,"The eyes were all on the newcomer. I was also looking at him, and I could notice that everything in him attracted attention: the beautiful and lofty head, the deep and magnetic gaze, the elegant and delicate manners, a certain distinct and unique look that contrasted with the cocky and prosaically measured look of the other young men.",CO006CL09
5463,127,"You should know that there are two species of young men: the ones who are elegant, and the ones who are simply embellished. Emílio belonged to the first family, while the others belonged to the second.",CO006CL09
5464,128,"I made this a quick examination. I couldn’t, nor did I desire to, meet Emílio’s eyes. I lowered my eyes and anxiously waited for the conversation to restart normally.",CO006CL09
5465,129,My husband became responsible for the general tone. Unfortunately the new guest was the main topic of the conversation.,CO006CL09
5466,130,"We came to know that Emílio was a provincial son of opulent parents and that he had received a polished education in Europe, where there was no place he didn’t visit.",CO006CL09
5467,131,"He had recently come back to Brazil, and before going to the countryside had decided to spend some time in Rio de Janeiro.",CO006CL09
5468,132,"That was everything we got to know about him. A thousand questions came up about Emílio’s travels, and he satisfied the general curiosity with the most adorable solicitude.",CO006CL09
5469,133,"I was the only one who wasn’t curious. The fact is that I couldn’t utter a word. I intimately searched for the explanation for this mysterious romance, which began in a theater hallway, continued with an anonymous letter and with an introduction, in my own house, intermediated by my own husband.",CO006CL09
5470,134,"Once in a while I raised my eyes towards Emílio and found him calm and cool, answering to all the questions politely and narrating some of his traveling adventures with a modest and natural grace.",CO006CL09
5471,135,"I had an idea. Would he really be the mysterious man from the theater and from the letter? At first I thought he was, but I could be wrong; the other man’s facial features weren’t very clear in my memory, and it seemed that the two creatures were one and the same; but couldn’t the mistake be explained by a miraculous resemblance?",CO006CL09
5472,136,"From reflection to reflection, time was going by, and I watched everybody’s conversations as if I weren’t there. Tea time came. Then we sang and played music. Emílio listened to everything with religious attention and showed himself to be as much an appreciator of taste as a discreet and pertinent converser.",CO006CL09
5473,137,"By the end of the evening it was possible to notice that everybody was fascinated by him. My husband, especially, was radiant. One could see that he was considering himself happy for having found another friend and a guest for our family meetings.",CO006CL09
5474,138,"Emílio left, promising he would return a few times.",CO006CL09
5475,139,"When I found myself alone with my husband, I asked him:",CO006CL09
5476,140,“Where do you know this man from?”,CO006CL09
5477,141,"“He’s a pearl, isn’t he? He was introduced to me in the office some days ago; I was immediately fond of him; he seems to be a good person, his spirit is lively and he is as discreet as common sense. There isn’t anyone who doesn’t like him…”",CO006CL09
5478,142,"As I was listening to him, serious and quiet, my husband stopped and asked me:",CO006CL09
5479,143,“Was I wrong bringing him here?”,CO006CL09
5480,144,"“Wrong, why?” I asked.",CO006CL09
5481,145,“No reason. Why should it be wrong? He’s a distinguished man…”,CO006CL09
5482,146,"I stopped any further praise of the young man, calling a slave to give him some orders.",CO006CL09
5483,147,I retired to my bedroom.,CO006CL09
5484,148,"You can believe that I didn’t have the sleep of righteous people that night. What annoyed me was the constant worry I was experiencing after these events. I couldn’t run away from the worry at all, it was involuntary and it dominated me, dragged me. It was a curiosity from the heart, this first sign of the storms to which our life and our future succumb.",CO006CL09
5485,149,"It seems that that man was reading my soul and knew how to introduce himself at the most proper moment to fill my imagination as a poetical and imposing figure. You, who came to know him afterward, can tell me whether, given the previous circumstances, he could really produce such impressions in the spirit of a woman like me!",CO006CL09
5486,150,"Like me, I repeat. My circumstances were special. You may not have known, but at least you suspected.",CO006CL09
5487,151,"If my husband saw me as a real wife, and if I saw him as a real husband, salvation would be certain. But the situation wasn’t like that. We entered our nuptial home like two strange travelers to an inn, two people who the stormy weather and advanced hour of the night force to stay for a while below the same roof.",CO006CL09
5488,152,My marriage was the result of a calculation and a convenience. I don’t blame my parents. They took care of my happiness and died believing that I was happy.,CO006CL09
5489,153,"I could, after all, find in the husband they gave me an object of happiness for all the days of my life. This would have happened if my husband saw in me a soul which could be a companion of his soul, a heart partner of his own heart. This wasn’t what happened, as my husband understood marriage like the majority of people; he saw in it the obedience to the Lord’s words in the Genesis.",CO006CL09
5490,154,"Apart from that, he surrounded me with a certain consideration and slept peacefully with the conviction that he had done his duty.",CO006CL09
5491,155,"Duty! This was my lifeline. I knew that passions weren’t superior and that our will may triumph over them. In this regard, I had enough strength in me to repress bad ideas. But what I feared most, and what suffocated me most wasn’t the present, but the future. Until now, that romance influenced my spirit because of the mystery that surrounded it; reality would open my eyes, and the hope that I would triumph over a guilty love consoled me. But could I, in this future, the proximity of which I couldn’t calculate, conveniently resist the passion and preserve my consideration and my conscience intact? That was the question.",CO006CL09
5492,156,"Well, in the midst of these oscillations, I didn’t see my husband offering his hand to save me. On the contrary, when I was burning the letter, I threw myself in his arms, and, as you remember, he repelled me with annoyed words.",CO006CL09
5493,157,This was what I thought and felt in the long night that followed Emilio’s introduction.,CO006CL09
5494,158,"My spirit was tired the following day, but, be it peace or prostration, what I felt was that the painful thoughts faded away with the morning light like true birds of loneliness and night.",CO006CL09
5495,159,Then a ray of light opened to my spirit. It was a repetition of the same thoughts that returned to me in the midst of my concerns from the latest days.,CO006CL09
5496,160,"“Why should I fear?” I said to myself. I’m a sad and fearful woman; and I tire myself by climbing a mountain and then falling in the middle of the plains. Oh! No obstacle can be opposed to my path of a virtuous and considerate woman. This man, if he is the same, doesn’t seem to be more than a bad reader of realistic novels. The mystery gives him some value; he’s vulgar or hideous when closely observed.",CO006CL09
5497,161,IV,CO006CL09
5498,162,I don’t want to tire you out with the daily and detailed narration of all events.,CO006CL09
5499,163,"Emílio continued to visit our house, always showing the same softness and gravity and fascinating everyone with his distinct and unaffected manners, which were lovely without pretense.",CO006CL09
5500,164,"I don’t know why my husband was becoming more and more friendly with Emílio, who could arouse in him an enthusiasm that was new for me and for everyone. What whim of nature was that?",CO006CL09
5501,165,"Many times I questioned my husband about that sudden and dazzling friendship. I wanted to arouse suspicions in his spirit, but he was unshakeable.",CO006CL09
5502,166,"“What do you want?” he answered. “I don’t know why I feel such fondness towards this young man. I feel he’s a beautiful person, and I can’t conceal my enthusiasm when I’m around him.”",CO006CL09
5503,167,“But you don’t even know him at all…” I objected.,CO006CL09
5504,168,"“Well now! I have the best information; and besides, one can see he is a distinguished person.”",CO006CL09
5505,169,“Manners deceive many times.”,CO006CL09
5506,170,“This is known…”,CO006CL09
5507,171,"I confess, my friend, that I could have imposed on my husband to pull away from Emílio; but when this idea came to my mind, I don’t know why I laughed at my fears and declared myself strong enough to resist everything that could befall.",CO006CL09
5508,172,"In addition, Emílio’s attitudes authorized me to disarm. He was extremely respectful toward me, treating me like the others, without letting people notice any occult intentions, or the least reserved thoughts.",CO006CL09
5509,173,"Naturally, it wasn’t adequate to act rigorously and reciprocate politeness with indifference.",CO006CL09
5510,174,"Things happened in such a way that I came to convince myself that all that happened beforehand wasn’t related to that young man, and that he had nothing but a resemblance to the man in the theater. Besides, I wasn’t sure about this because, as I told you, I couldn’t observe the mysterious man in the theater very well.",CO006CL09
5511,175,"It happened that within a short period of time we were in the greatest intimacy, and I was for him the same thing that the others were: admirer and admired.",CO006CL09
5512,176,"Emílio began to visit us during the day, when my husband was at home, and later, even when he was absent.",CO006CL09
5513,177,"He was normally brought by my husband. Emílio would come in the small carriage he himself used to drive, with grace and elegance. He spent hours on end in our house, playing the piano or talking.",CO006CL09
5514,178,"The first time I welcomed him alone, I confess I trembled; but it was a puerile shock, as Emílio always acted in the same indifferent way in relation to my suspicions. That day, the only ones that had remained simply vanished.",CO006CL09
5515,179,Two months went by.,CO006CL09
5516,180,"One afternoon, I was alone, waiting for you to visit your ill father. A coach stopped at the front door. I asked somebody to check who it was. It was Emílio.",CO006CL09
5517,181,I welcomed him as I usual.,CO006CL09
5518,182,"I told him I was going to visit an ill person, and he said he was going to leave. I told him to stay until your arrival. He stayed, as if he were held by reasons other than a courteous duty.",CO006CL09
5519,183,Half an hour went by.,CO006CL09
5520,184,Our conversation was mainly about indifferent subjects.,CO006CL09
5521,185,In one of the intervals of the conversation Emílio stood up and went to the window. I also stood up to go to the piano to get a fan. When I returned to the sofa I could see through the mirror that Emílio was looking at me in a strange way. It was a transfiguration. It seemed that all his soul was concentrated in that gaze.,CO006CL09
5522,186,I trembled.,CO006CL09
5523,187,"However, I made an effort and sat down, more serious than ever.",CO006CL09
5524,188,Emílio walked toward me.,CO006CL09
5525,189,I looked at him.,CO006CL09
5526,190,<NOT INCLUDED>,CO006CL09
5527,191,I lowered my eyes.,CO006CL09
5528,192,“Are you scared?” he asked me.,CO006CL09
5529,193,"I didn’t answer anything. But I started trembling again, and it seemed that my heart wanted to jump out of my chest.",CO006CL09
5530,194,The fact is that in his look was the same expression in those words of the letter that had the same effect on me.,CO006CL09
5531,195,“Are you scared?” he repeated.,CO006CL09
5532,196,<NOT INCLUDED>,CO006CL09
5533,197,<NOT INCLUDED>,CO006CL09
5534,198,There was a silence.,CO006CL09
5535,199,"“Mrs. Eugênia,” he said taking a seat. “I don’t want to hide the secret that became the torment of my life. It was a useless sacrifice. Happy or unhappy, I prefer the certainty of my situation. Mrs. Eugênia, I love you.”",CO006CL09
5536,200,"I can’t describe how I heard these words. I felt that I paled; my hands were cold. I wanted to speak, but I couldn’t.",CO006CL09
5537,201,Emílio continued:,CO006CL09
5538,202,"“Oh! I know I am exposing myself. I see how this is a guilty love. But what to do? It’s inevitable. I walked so many leagues, I walked by so many beauties without feeling my heart throb. What life reserved for me was either the rare venture or the great misfortune of being loved or rejected by you. I bow to fate. I will accept and not refuse any answer you give me. What’s your answer?”",CO006CL09
5539,203,"While he was speaking, I could, by listening to his words, put together some ideas. When he finished I looked at him and said:",CO006CL09
5540,204,“What answer do you expect from me?”,CO006CL09
5541,205,“Any.”,CO006CL09
5542,206,“You can only wait for one…”,CO006CL09
5543,207,“Don’t you love me?”,CO006CL09
5544,208,"“No! I can’t love you, and I wouldn’t love if I could or wanted… I ask you to leave.”",CO006CL09
5545,209,I stood up.,CO006CL09
5546,210,Emílio stood up.,CO006CL09
5547,211,"“I will leave,” he said, “and I will go with hell in my heart.”",CO006CL09
5548,212,I shrugged with indifference.,CO006CL09
5549,213,“Oh! I well know that you’re indifferent. That’s what hurts more. Hate is what I would have preferred; but you can believe that indifference is the worst punishment. But I’m resigned. Such a crime must have such punishment.”,CO006CL09
5550,214,"And taking his hat, he got close to me again.",CO006CL09
5551,215,I took two steps back.,CO006CL09
5552,216,“Oh! Don’t be afraid. Are you afraid of me?”,CO006CL09
5553,217,"“Fear,” I retorted haughtily.",CO006CL09
5554,218,“Do you loathe me?” he asked.,CO006CL09
5555,219,“Perhaps…” I murmured.,CO006CL09
5556,220,"“Just one answer,” Emílio rejoined, “do you still have that letter?”",CO006CL09
5557,221,“Ah!” I said. “Were you the author of that letter?”,CO006CL09
5558,222,“I was. The mysterious man in the corridor of the Theatro Lyrico. It was me. What about the letter?”,CO006CL09
5559,223,“I burned it.”,CO006CL09
5560,224,“You foresaw my thought.”,CO006CL09
5561,225,"He went to the door, said good-bye to me in a cold way. Almost reaching the door I felt that he faltered and put his hand on his chest.",CO006CL09
5562,226,"I had a moment of pity. But it was necessary for him to go, suffering or not. However, I took a step towards him and asked:",CO006CL09
5563,227,“Could you give me an answer?”,CO006CL09
5564,228,He stopped and turned to me.,CO006CL09
5565,229,“Yes!”,CO006CL09
5566,230,"“To do what you did, how did you pretend to be my husband’s friend?”",CO006CL09
5567,231,"“I know it was a dishonest act, but my love is the kind that doesn’t retreat when faced with indignity. It’s the only feeling I understand. But forgive me; I don’t want to bother you anymore. Goodbye! Forever!”",CO006CL09
5568,232,And he left.,CO006CL09
5569,233,I thought I heard him sobbing.,CO006CL09
5570,234,I sat on the sofa. In a few minutes I heard the coach rolling.,CO006CL09
5571,235,I don’t know how the time went by between his departure and your arrival. I stayed in the place where you found me.,CO006CL09
5572,236,Until that moment I hadn’t seen love except in books. That man seemed to fulfill the love I dreamt about and saw being described. The idea that Emílio’s heart was bleeding aroused in me a lively feeling of pity. Pity was the first step.,CO006CL09
5573,237,"“Who knows,” I said to myself, “what he’s suffering now? Is this his fault, after all? He loves me, as he said: love was stronger than reason; he didn’t see I was sacred of him; he revealed himself. He loves me, that’s his excuse.”",CO006CL09
5574,238,"Afterwards I remembered all his words, as well as the tone he used to say them. I also remembered what I had said and the tone I had used to respond to his confessions.",CO006CL09
5575,239,"Perhaps I was too severe. I could have kept my dignity without opening a wound in his heart. I could have achieved more respect and veneration if I had spoken more softly. He may still love me, but he won’t remember what happened without a sense of bitterness.",CO006CL09
5576,240,I was reflecting on this when you arrived.,CO006CL09
5577,241,"Do you remember you found me sad and asked me what the cause was? I answered nothing. We went to your aunt’s house, and I didn’t change anything of what I said.",CO006CL09
5578,242,"When my husband asked about Emílio that evening, I replied without knowing what I was doing:",CO006CL09
5579,243,“He didn’t come here today.”,CO006CL09
5580,244,“Really?” he said. “So he’s sick.”,CO006CL09
5581,245,“I don’t know.”,CO006CL09
5582,246,“I’ll go there tomorrow.”,CO006CL09
5583,247,“There where?”,CO006CL09
5584,248,“To his house.”,CO006CL09
5585,249,“What for?”,CO006CL09
5586,250,“Maybe he’s sick.”,CO006CL09
5587,251,“I don’t believe so…. Let’s wait and see.”,CO006CL09
5588,252,"I spent an anguished night. Emílio’s image troubled my sleep. I thought he would be, at that moment, crying tears of blood in the despair of unrequited love.",CO006CL09
5589,253,Was it pity? Was it love?,CO006CL09
5590,254,"Carlota, it was one thing or the other. What else could it be? I put my feet in a fatal path; a force was attracting me. I was weak, and I was able to be strong. I can’t blame anybody else but myself.",CO006CL09
5591,255,I’ll write again on Sunday.,CO006CL09
5592,256,V,CO006CL09
5593,257,"When my husband returned the following afternoon, I asked him about Emílio.",CO006CL09
5594,258,"“I didn’t look for him,” he answered me. “I accepted your advice; I’ll do that if he doesn’t come over today.”",CO006CL09
5595,259,"In fact, we didn’t hear about him for one day.",CO006CL09
5596,260,"As he didn’t visit the following day, my husband went to look for him.",CO006CL09
5597,261,"I’ll be honest with you, I myself asked my husband to do so.",CO006CL09
5598,262,I anxiously waited for the answer.,CO006CL09
5599,263,My husband came back in the afternoon. He seemed to be sad. I asked to him what happened.,CO006CL09
5600,264,"“I don’t know. I found him ill, lying on his bed. It seemed to be a little cold, but I believe that this is not the main reason…”",CO006CL09
5601,265,"“What would it be?” I asked, staring at my husband.",CO006CL09
5602,266,"“Something else. He said he is traveling north. He’s sad, distracted, worried. He wants to see his parents but, at the same time, he’s afraid he won’t see them again. He’s afraid of dying during the trip. I don’t know what happened to him, but something happened. Perhaps…”",CO006CL09
5603,267,“Perhaps?”,CO006CL09
5604,268,“Perhaps it’s a loss of money.”,CO006CL09
5605,269,This answer really disturbed my spirit. I can assure you that such an answer was key to the things that happened afterwards.,CO006CL09
5606,270,After a moment of silence I asked:,CO006CL09
5607,271,“But what do you intend to do?”,CO006CL09
5608,272,"“Open my heart to him, ask him what happened, offer help if it’s possible. In any case I won’t let him leave. What do you think?”",CO006CL09
5609,273,“I think you’re right.”,CO006CL09
5610,274,Everything that happened powerfully contributed to turn Emílio’s image ever more present in my memory. I painfully confess that I couldn’t think about him without feeling my heart throb.,CO006CL09
5611,275,"I was meeting some people the following evening. I couldn’t cheer up the meeting. I was sad and desperate. I was angry at myself. I became Emílio’s tormentor, and the idea that he was suffering because of me was even more torturous.",CO006CL09
5612,276,"But it was nine o’clock when my husband appeared, leading Emílio by the arm.",CO006CL09
5613,277,There was a general movement of surprise.,CO006CL09
5614,278,It was really because Emílio didn’t appear for some days that everyone began to ask about him. But the surprise was bigger because he was as pale as wax.,CO006CL09
5615,279,"I wouldn’t tell you what happened that evening. Emílio seemed to be suffering. He wasn’t happy as before; on the contrary, his disposition was so sad and taciturn that everybody was disturbed. I was atrociously mortified, as I was the cause of his pain.",CO006CL09
5616,280,"I was able to talk to him once, keeping the distant from others.",CO006CL09
5617,281,"“I’m sorry,” I said, “if I said tough words to you. You understand my position. I couldn’t think about what you said, as I heard it abruptly. I know you suffered; I ask you not to suffer anymore and to forget…”",CO006CL09
5618,282,"“Thank you,” he murmured.",CO006CL09
5619,283,“My husband told me about some of your projects…”,CO006CL09
5620,284,“Of going back to my province. That’s true.”,CO006CL09
5621,285,“But you’re ill…”,CO006CL09
5622,286,“This illness will have an end.”,CO006CL09
5623,287,He looked at me in a sinister way. I was afraid.,CO006CL09
5624,288,“Have an end? How?”,CO006CL09
5625,289,“Somehow.”,CO006CL09
5626,290,“Don’t say that.”,CO006CL09
5627,291,“What else do I have to do on Earth?”,CO006CL09
5628,292,And he turned his eyes to wipe his tears.,CO006CL09
5629,293,“What’s this?” I said. “Are you crying?”,CO006CL09
5630,294,“The last tears.”,CO006CL09
5631,295,"“Oh! If you knew how you’re making me suffer! Don’t cry, I ask you. I ask you more. I ask you to live.”",CO006CL09
5632,296,“Oh!”,CO006CL09
5633,297,“I command you to live.”,CO006CL09
5634,298,“You command me? And what if I don’t obey you? And what if I couldn’t? Do you believe it’s possible to live with a thorn in your heart?”,CO006CL09
5635,299,"What I write to you is ugly. The way he spoke was infatuated, painful and heartbreaking. I listened without knowing about myself. Some people were approaching. I finished the conversation and said:",CO006CL09
5636,300,“Do you love me?” I said. “Could only love give orders? Love commands you to live!”,CO006CL09
5637,301,Emílio made a gesture of happiness. I stood up to talk to the people who were coming closer.,CO006CL09
5638,302,"“Thank you,” he murmured in my ears.",CO006CL09
5639,303,"When Emílio bid me goodbye at the end of the evening, saying, with eyes full of love and gratitude, “see you tomorrow,” I don’t know what kind of feelings of love and confusion, remorse and tenderness took hold of me.",CO006CL09
5640,304,"“Well, Emílio is happier,” my husband said.",CO006CL09
5641,305,I looked at him without knowing how to respond.,CO006CL09
5642,306,Then I hastily retired. It seemed I saw in my husband the image of my consciousness.,CO006CL09
5643,307,The following day I received this letter from Emílio:,CO006CL09
5644,308,"“Eugênia. Thank you. I came back to life and I owe this to you. Thank you! You turned a corpse into a man, now turn a man into a god. Courage! Courage!”",CO006CL09
5645,309,"I read this letter over and over again and… what can I tell you, Carlota? I kissed it. I kissed it many times with my soul, my passion and my delirium. I was in love! I was in love!",CO006CL09
5646,310,"Then I felt the same struggle, but my feelings changed. Earlier, my heart that fled from reason; now reason fled from my heart.",CO006CL09
5647,311,"I could see and feel that it was a crime; but I don’t know what my fate was, what my nature was, and I found excuses for my crime in the delights of my own mistakes, and used this idea to legitimize my passion.",CO006CL09
5648,312,I felt better and braver when my husband was close to me.,CO006CL09
5649,313,I’ll stop here this time. I feel my chest oppressed due to the memory of all these events.,CO006CL09
5650,314,I’ll write again on Sunday.,CO006CL09
5651,315,VI,CO006CL09
5652,316,Some days went by after the facts I told you in my last letter.,CO006CL09
5653,317,Emílio and I began to write letters to each other. By the end of fifteen days I lived only by thoughts of him.,CO006CL09
5654,318,"None of the people who came to our house, not even you, were able to discover this love. We were two extremely discreet lovers.",CO006CL09
5655,319,"Some people asked why I was so absent-minded and melancholic; such an observation called me back for real life, and I soon changed my disposition.",CO006CL09
5656,320,My husband seemed to suffer with my sadness.,CO006CL09
5657,321,"I confess that his solicitude annoyed me. Many times I answered him in a rough way, not because I hated him but because he was the only person from whom I did not want to hear these questionings.",CO006CL09
5658,322,"One afternoon, having come back home, he said:",CO006CL09
5659,323,"“Eugênia, I have some news for you.”",CO006CL09
5660,324,“What?”,CO006CL09
5661,325,“This is something that will please you very much.”,CO006CL09
5662,326,“What is it?”,CO006CL09
5663,327,“It’s a walk.”,CO006CL09
5664,328,“Where?”,CO006CL09
5665,329,“It was my idea. I went to Emílio and he agreed with it. The walk should be in Gávea9 on Sunday; we will leave very early. But we haven’t decided anything yet. It depends on you. Do you accept?”,CO006CL09
5666,330,“I do.”,CO006CL09
5667,331,“Very well. Carlota can go.”,CO006CL09
5668,332,"“She should go,” I added, “She and some other friends.”",CO006CL09
5669,333,Soon afterwards you and the others received a note with an invitation for the walk.,CO006CL09
5670,334,"You remember that we went there. What you don’t know is that on this walk, to the benefit of the general confusion and distraction, Emílio and I had a dialogue which represented, to me, the first souring of love.",CO006CL09
5671,335,"“Eugênia,” he said when he gave me his arm, “are you sure that you love me?”",CO006CL09
5672,336,"“Yes, I am.”",CO006CL09
5673,337,"“Well. What I ask you, and it’s not me who’s asking you, it’s my heart, it’s your heart that ask for a noble attitude able to ennoble ourselves before our own eyes. Wouldn’t there be a place where we could live far from everyone and next to heaven?”",CO006CL09
5674,338,"“You mean, run away?”",CO006CL09
5675,339,“Yes!”,CO006CL09
5676,340,"“Oh, I would never do that!”",CO006CL09
5677,341,“You don’t love me.”,CO006CL09
5678,342,"“I do love you, and it’s a crime, and I don’t want to go any further.”",CO006CL09
5679,343,“Do you refuse happiness?”,CO006CL09
5680,344,“I refuse dishonor.”,CO006CL09
5681,345,“You don’t love me.”,CO006CL09
5682,346,"“Oh! My God, how could I answer to you? I do love you, but I wish I were always the same woman before your eyes, loving but… pure.”",CO006CL09
5683,347,“Love which is calculated is not love.”,CO006CL09
5684,348,"I didn’t answer him. Emílio said these words with a scornful expression and with the intention of hurting me. I felt my heart throbbing fast, and blood rose into my face.",CO006CL09
5685,349,The walk ended in a bad way.,CO006CL09
5686,350,"After that day Emílio became cold towards me. I suffered with that. I tried to restore him to his previous state, but I couldn’t.",CO006CL09
5687,351,One day when we were alone I said to him:,CO006CL09
5688,352,"“Emílio, if I followed you tomorrow, what would you do?”",CO006CL09
5689,353,“I would obey such a divine order.”,CO006CL09
5690,354,“But what about afterwards?”,CO006CL09
5691,355,“Afterwards?” Emílio asked as if he thought it was a strange question.,CO006CL09
5692,356,"“Yes, afterwards,” I continued, “after some time wouldn’t you look at me disdainfully?”",CO006CL09
5693,357,“Disdain? I don’t…”,CO006CL09
5694,358,“You don’t? What would I deserve from you then?”,CO006CL09
5695,359,"“Oh! You’d make this sacrifice because of me, and I would be a coward if I rubbed it in your face.”",CO006CL09
5696,360,“You would say this to yourself.”,CO006CL09
5697,361,“I swear I wouldn’t.”,CO006CL09
5698,362,“I see things this way. I would never forgive myself for this mistake.”,CO006CL09
5699,363,"Emílio put his face in his hands and seemed to start crying. I was speaking with an effort until that moment, when I went to him and took his face in my hands.",CO006CL09
5700,364,"“What’s this?” I said. “Don’t you see I am crying, too?”",CO006CL09
5701,365,He looked at me with his eyes full of tears. My eyes were humid.,CO006CL09
5702,366,"“Goodbye,” he said suddenly. “I will leave.”",CO006CL09
5703,367,He went to the door.,CO006CL09
5704,368,"“Leave if you promise me you will live,” I said, “Stay if you have sinister ideas.”",CO006CL09
5705,369,"I don’t know what he saw in my look, but he took my hand and kissed it many times (these were the first kisses) and said to me, infatuated:",CO006CL09
5706,370,"“I stay, Eugênia!”",CO006CL09
5707,371,"We heard a noise outside. I asked somebody to check. My husband was arriving, and he was sick. He’d had some kind of attack in his office. He came to, but he was really bad. Some friends brought him in a carriage.",CO006CL09
5708,372,I ran to the door. My husband was pale and weak. He could hardly walk without the help of his friends.,CO006CL09
5709,373,"I was desperate, and I couldn’t take care of anything else. The doctor who accompanied my husband soon asked him to take some remedies. I was impatient and asking everyone if he could be saved.",CO006CL09
5710,374,Everybody was trying to calm me down.,CO006CL09
5711,375,Emílio was sorry for such a happening. He went to my husband and squeezed his hand.,CO006CL09
5712,376,"When Emílio said he wanted to leave, my husband said to him:",CO006CL09
5713,377,"“Look, I know you can’t always be here, but I ask you to come here every day.”",CO006CL09
5714,378,"“But of course,” Emílio said.  And he left.",CO006CL09
5715,379,My husband was ill for the rest of the day and the night. I didn’t sleep. I spent the night in the bedroom.,CO006CL09
5716,380,"I was exhausted the following day. I was prostrated by a confusion of feeleings and by a long vigil. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I asked my cousin Elvira to come over, and I went to sleep.",CO006CL09
5717,381,I finish the letter at this point. My sad story is coming to an end.,CO006CL09
5718,382,‘Til Sunday.,CO006CL09
5719,383,VII,CO006CL09
5720,384,My husband’s illness lasted for eight days. It became even worse day by day. By the end of the eight days the doctors gave the patient up as incurable.,CO006CL09
5721,385,"I went insane when I received this fatal news. He was my husband, Carlota, and I couldn’t forget he had been my life’s companion and the saving grace in the deviations of my spirit.",CO006CL09
5722,386,Emílio found me in a state of despair. He tried to comfort me. I didn’t hide from him that my husband’s death was a deep pain.,CO006CL09
5723,387,"One evening we were all together, me, cousin Elvira, one of my husband’s relatives, and Emílio. We kept my husband’s company. After a long silence, he said to me:",CO006CL09
5724,388,“Your hand.”,CO006CL09
5725,389,He grabbed my hand with supreme energy and turned to the wall. He expired.,CO006CL09
5726,390,Four months went by after all the facts that I have told you. Emílio was my assiduous companion in the pain and in all the mournful ceremonies held for my deceased husband.,CO006CL09
5727,391,"His visits, however, became scarce. I interpreted it as a natural courtesy on his part.",CO006CL09
5728,392,"By the end of the four months, some friends told me that Emílio was leaving. I could hardly believe it. I wrote him a letter.",CO006CL09
5729,393,"I loved him as before and more than ever, as I was now free.",CO006CL09
5730,394,The letter said:,CO006CL09
5731,395,Emílio. I heard you are leaving. Would that be possible? I can’t believe my ears. You know that I love you. It’s not time to celebrate our vows; but little time is left for the world to give us the union love imposes on us. Come here to answer me in person.,CO006CL09
5732,396,"Yours, Eugênia.",CO006CL09
5733,397,"He came. He assured me he was traveling for business, but he would come back soon. He would be traveling in eight days.",CO006CL09
5734,398,"I asked him to swear to what he’d said, and he did.",CO006CL09
5735,399,I let him go.,CO006CL09
5736,400,Four days later I received this other letter from him:,CO006CL09
5737,401,"I lied to you, Eugênia; I will leave now. I also lied when I said that I will be back. I won’t because I can’t. Marrying you would be the ideal happiness if I weren’t a man with habits that are opposed to marriage. Goodbye. I apologize and ask you to pray so that I can have a nice trip. Goodbye. Emílio.",CO006CL09
5738,402,"You can easily evaluate what I felt when I finished reading this letter. The castle collapsed. I was receiving indifference and ingratitude in exchange for my love, my first love. It was fair: such a guilty love couldn’t end well; I was being punished with the consequences of my crime.",CO006CL09
5739,403,"I asked myself why such a man, who seemed to love me so much, refused a woman in whose honesty he could believe, as she opposed some resistance to the desires of his heart? This seemed to be a mystery. Today I see that it wasn’t. Emílio was a vulgar seducer but he was a little bit more skilled than the others.",CO006CL09
5740,404,That’s my story. You can imagine how I suffered these two years. But time is a good doctor: I am cured.,CO006CL09
5741,405,The offended love and the remorse for having cheated on my husband’s trust hurt me very much. But I believe that I paid an expensive price for my crime and I find myself rehabilitated with my conscience.,CO006CL09
5742,406,Would I be also rehabilitated before God?,CO006CL09
5743,407,What about you? You will explain this to me tomorrow; I will be with you twenty four hours after sending this letter,CO006CL09

5748,3,"TWO YEARS AGO, I made an unusual decision: I took myself off to Petrópolis in the middle of the month of June—to live. This decision proved fertile ground for conjectures. Even you, in the letters you wrote to me here, squandered your energies on trying to guess or imagine a thousand reasons, each more absurd than the last.",CO006CL10
5749,4,"I did not nor could I respond to those letters, in which your evident concern betrayed two simultaneous feelings: the affection of a friend and the curiosity of a woman. It wasn’t the right moment to open my heart to you or to unfold to you the various reasons that drove me from Rio, where the operas at the Teatro Lírico, your parties, and Cousin Barros’s family gatherings would have provided me with distractions after my husband’s recent death.",CO006CL10
5750,5,"Indeed, many believed his demise to be the sole reason for my departure. That was the least equivocal version. I let it pass as I did all the others and stayed in Petrópolis. As soon as summer arrived, you came here with your husband, determined not to return to Rio until you had discovered the secret I was refusing to reveal. I remained as silent as the tomb, as inscrutable as the Sphinx. You lay down your weapons and left.",CO006CL10

5754,9,It is time to tell you about this episode in my life.,CO006CL10
5755,10,"I prefer to do so in letters rather than face-to-face. Were I with you, I might blush. The heart opens up more easily in letters and shame does not stop certain words from being spoken. Notice that I make no mention of tears, which is a sign that my peace of mind has returned.",CO006CL10

I was, by general consent, the queen-elect, and presided over any family gatherings held in my house.

5776,31,"Some evil spirit whispered in my ear, for I replied tartly that I absolutely had to go to the theater, and that he must go with me. He repeated his request and I repeated my refusal. It did not take much for me to think that somehow my honor was at stake. Now I see that it was either pure vanity on my part or else fate.",CO006CL10
5777,32,"I held a certain sway over my husband. My imperious tone would brook no refusal, and my husband finally gave in, and we went to the theater.",CO006CL10
5778,33,"There was a very sparse audience, and the singers all had bad colds. At the end of the first act, my husband smiled vengefully and said:",CO006CL10

5780,35,“Meaning what?” I asked with a frown.,CO006CL10

I didn’t notice this at first, until I was forced to by the sheer insistence of his gaze. I looked at him to see if he was some acquaintance of ours waiting to be discovered so that he could come and greet us. The fact that he knew us might explain his odd behavior, but I didn’t know him at all.",CO006CL10

5792,47,The man was still there.,CO006CL10
5793,48,I asked my husband to close the door.,CO006CL10
5794,49,The second act began.,CO006CL10
5795,50,"Then, in a spirit of curiosity, I waited to see if the watcher would take his place in the stalls. I wanted to get a better look at him among the crowd.",CO006CL10
5796,51,"However, he either didn’t take his seat or I failed to spot him.",CO006CL10
5797,52,The second act was even more tedious than the first.,CO006CL10

5800,55,"I saw no one, but a few minutes later, the same man arrived and stood in the same place and stared at me with the same impertinent eyes.",CO006CL10
5801,56,"We women are always vain about our looks and want to be admired for our beauty. This is why we’re often indiscreet enough to enjoy a man’s rather dangerous flattery. There is, however, a form of flattery that irritates and frightens; it irritates because it’s impertinent and frightens because it’s dangerous. This was the case here.",CO006CL10
5802,57,"My admirer’s insistence presented me with a dilemma: he was either the victim of a mad passion or possessed of an impudent audacity. Either way, I should clearly not encourage his feelings.",CO006CL10
5803,58,I thought all this during the interval. The third act was about to begin. I waited for my silent pursuer to withdraw and then said to my husband:,CO006CL10

5805,60,“Are you sure?”,CO006CL10
5806,61,"“Yes, the opera’s wonderful, but I just feel really sleepy.”",CO006CL10

5808,63,"“If it’s so wonderful, why are you sleepy?”",CO006CL10
5809,64,I did not reply.,CO006CL10
5810,65,We left.,CO006CL10
5811,66,"In the corridor, we met the Azevedo family, who were just returning from visiting an acquaintance of theirs in a neighboring box. I paused to embrace the ladies in the party. I told them we were leaving because I had a headache.",CO006CL10
5812,67,We reached the door that opened onto Rua dos Ciganos.,CO006CL10
5813,68,I waited there for some minutes for our carriage to arrive.,CO006CL10
5814,69,"And who should appear, leaning in the doorway?",CO006CL10
5815,70,The mysterious stranger.,CO006CL10
5816,71,I was furious.,CO006CL10
5817,72,"I covered my face as best I could with my hood and waited for the carriage, which arrived soon afterward.",CO006CL10
5818,73,"The mysterious man stood there, as impassive and silent as the door he was leaning against.",CO006CL10
5819,74,"During the journey home, I could not stop thinking about that incident. I was only roused from my abstraction when the carriage drew up at the door of our house, in Rua Matacavalos.",CO006CL10
5820,75,I felt ashamed of myself and decided to think no more about the matter.,CO006CL10
5821,76,"But would you believe it, Carlota? It took me half an hour to get to sleep, because my imagination insisted on revisiting the corridor, the doorway, and my platonic admirer.",CO006CL10
5822,77,"The following day, I thought about it less. A week later, it had been wiped from my memory, and I thanked God for saving me from an obsession that could have proved fatal.",CO006CL10
5823,78,I decided to embrace that divine help and resolved not to go to the theater for some time.,CO006CL10
5824,79,"I concentrated on domestic life and, for distraction, relied on getting together with friends in the evening.",CO006CL10
5825,80,"Meanwhile, the day of your little girl’s birthday was fast approaching. I remembered that, a month before, in order to contribute to the celebrations, I had begun knitting her a little present, which I needed to finish.",CO006CL10

5827,82,"I thought this very odd. There was no name on the envelope. It was sealed and appeared to be waiting to be opened by whoever it was intended for. Who could that be? My husband? I was accustomed to opening any letters addressed to him, and so I did not hesitate. I broke the seal on the envelope and found a pink sheet of paper inside.",CO006CL10
5828,83,The letter said:,CO006CL10
5829,84,"Do not be surprised, Eugênia; this letter is the product of despair and that despair is the product of love. I love you—very much. For some time now, I have tried to drive away that feeling, to smother it, but I can do so no longer. Did you not see me at the Teatro Lírico? A secret, inner force led me there. But I have not seen you since. When will I see you again? Although, if I do not see you, then I must be patient. However, if your heart were to beat for me for just one minute of each day that would be enough for a love that seeks neither mere sensual pleasure nor public recognition. If I offend you, please forgive this sinner; if you could love me, you would make me a god.",CO006CL10
5830,85,"I read this letter with tremulous hands and tear-filled eyes; and for some minutes afterward, I was completely lost to the world.",CO006CL10
5831,86,"A thousand different, contradictory ideas went through my mind, like those great flocks of black birds that fly across the sky when a storm is approaching.",CO006CL10
5832,87,"Could it be love that had made that stranger write to me? Or was it just a trap laid by a calculating seducer? I looked vaguely around me, afraid my husband might come in.",CO006CL10
5833,88,"The sheet of paper was there before me, and those mysterious words seemed to me like the eyes of an evil serpent. Without thinking, I crumpled it nervously up in my hands.",CO006CL10
5834,89,"If Eve had done the same with the head of the serpent tempting her, there would have been no sin. I, alas, could not be so sure of obtaining the same result, because the serpent I could see and whose head I had crushed, could, like the Hydra of Lerna, sprout many more heads.",CO006CL10
5835,90,"Don’t be surprised at this mixture of biblical and pagan imagery. At the time, I wasn’t thinking, my mind was merely rambling; only long afterward could I think straight.",CO006CL10
5836,91,"Two feelings were at work within me: firstly, a kind of terror of the abyss, the deep abyss which I sensed lay behind that letter; secondly, a sense of bitter shame that I was low enough in that stranger’s esteem for him to stoop to such measures.",CO006CL10
5837,92,"Only when I had calmed down did it occur to me to think what I should have thought right at the start. Who had put that letter there? My first impulse was to summon all the servants. What stopped me was the realization that while I would probably learn nothing from a simple question, everyone would then know about the letter. And what purpose would that serve?",CO006CL10
5838,93,I summoned no one.,CO006CL10
5839,94,"I could not help thinking, though, that the letter had been a bold move, which could have failed at every turn; what could have motivated that man to take such a step? Love or the desire to seduce?",CO006CL10
5840,95,"Returning to this dilemma, my mind, despite all the dangers involved, wanted to accept that first hypothesis, because it was the one that suited my situation as a married woman and my vanity as a beautiful one.",CO006CL10
5841,96,"I tried to find out the truth by reading the letter again: I read it not once, twice, thrice, but five times.",CO006CL10
5842,97,"An unhealthy curiosity drew me to it. Finally, I made an effort and resolved to destroy it, promising myself that if a second letter should appear, I would dismiss every servant and slave in the house.",CO006CL10
5843,98,"Still clutching the piece of paper, I left the living room and went to my own room, where I lit a candle and burned the letter that was burning my hands and my head.",CO006CL10
5844,99,"As the last scrap of paper blackened and crumpled, I heard footsteps behind me. It was my husband.",CO006CL10
5845,100,I spontaneously threw myself into his arms.,CO006CL10
5846,101,"Somewhat surprised, he returned my embrace.",CO006CL10
5847,102,"However, when my embrace continued, I felt him gently pushing me away, saying:",CO006CL10
5848,103,"“That’s enough, now. You’re suffocating me.”",CO006CL10
5849,104,I drew back.,CO006CL10
5850,105,"It saddened me to see that the man who could and should save me was incapable of understanding, even instinctively, that I was clinging to him as though to the idea of duty.",CO006CL10
5851,106,"Then the feeling clutching at my heart gave way for a moment to a feeling of fear. The ashes from the burned letter were still there on the floor, and there was the candle lit in broad daylight. That should have been enough to prompt a few questions, but he was not even curious enough to ask.",CO006CL10
5852,107,"He took a couple of steps about the room, then left.",CO006CL10
5853,108,"I felt a single tear roll down my cheek. It wasn’t the first bitter tear I would shed, but it was perhaps the first indication of sin.",CO006CL10
5854,109,III,CO006CL10
5855,110,A month passed.,CO006CL10
5856,111,"During that time, nothing at home changed. No second letter appeared, and my extreme vigilance proved futile.",CO006CL10
5857,112,"I could not forget about the letter, though. Ah, if it were only a matter of not forgetting, but the first words kept resurfacing again and again in my memory, then the others, then all of them. I knew the letter by heart!",CO006CL10
5858,113,"Do you remember? One of the things I often used to boast about was my excellent memory. Even that gift proved to be a punishment. Those words distracted me, made my head throb. Why? Ah, Carlota, it’s because I found in those words an indefinable charm, a painful charm, because it was accompanied by feelings of remorse—but a charm from which I could not free myself.",CO006CL10
5859,114,"It wasn’t my heart that was to blame, it was my imagination. My imagination was leading me into perdition; the struggle between duty and the imagination is cruel and dangerous for weak souls. And I was weak. It was the mystery of it all that so captured my imagination.",CO006CL10
5860,115,"In the end, time and other diversions deflected my mind from that obsessive thought. After a month had elapsed, while I had not completely forgotten about the mysterious stranger and his letter, I was at least calm enough to laugh at myself and my fears.",CO006CL10
5861,116,"One Thursday night, we had a few visitors, among them many of my female friends, although not your good self. My husband had not yet come home from work, but his absence was neither noticed nor felt, given that, however decent a fellow he was, he was never exactly the life and soul of the party.",CO006CL10
5862,117,"We had sung and played and talked amid an atmosphere of frank and generous enjoyment; Amélia Azevedo’s uncle was amusing us with his eccentricities; Amélia garnered much applause with her heavenly voice; and we had just reached a pause, waiting for tea to be served.",CO006CL10
5863,118,"At that point, my husband arrived.",CO006CL10
5864,119,"He was not alone. At his side was a tall, slim, elegant man, whom I did not recognize. In the ensuing silence, my husband stepped forward and introduced him to me.",CO006CL10
5865,120,I heard my husband say that our guest was called Emílio ***.,CO006CL10
5866,121,"Only then did I see him properly, and I had to suppress a gasp.",CO006CL10
5867,122,It was him!,CO006CL10
5868,123,"My gasp was replaced by a look of surprise. No one noticed. He, even less. He fixed his eyes on me and, with a gracious bow, addressed a few flattering, courteous remarks to me.",CO006CL10
5869,124,I replied as best I could.,CO006CL10
5870,125,"Further introductions were made, and for ten minutes, an awkward silence reigned.",CO006CL10
5871,126,"All eyes were turned on the new arrival. My eyes were turned on him, too, and I could see that everything about him conspired to attract attention: a proud, handsome head, deep, magnetic eyes, elegant, delicate manners, an easy, distinguished air, in marked contrast with the affected, prosaically self-conscious air of the other young men.",CO006CL10
5872,127,<null>,CO006CL10
5873,128,"My examination of him was necessarily brief. I could not, nor did I want to, meet Emílio’s eyes. I lowered my gaze and waited anxiously for the conversation to resume its normal course.",CO006CL10
5874,129,"My husband took it upon himself to set the tone. Unfortunately, the new guest was still the subject of the general conversation that followed.",CO006CL10
5875,130,"We learned that Emílio was from the provinces, the son of wealthy parents, and had been educated in Europe, whose every corner he had visited.",CO006CL10
5876,131,"He had returned to Brazil only recently and, before going back to his provincial roots, had decided to spend a little time in Rio de Janeiro.",CO006CL10
5877,132,"That is all we found out. There followed many questions about his travels, and he replied in a most friendly, helpful fashion.",CO006CL10
5878,133,"I was the only one who showed no curiosity, because I was struck dumb. I wanted an explanation for that mysterious romance, which had begun in a theater corridor and continued with an anonymous letter and his arrival in my house with my own husband as intermediary.",CO006CL10
5879,134,"From time to time, I would glance across at Emílio and find him looking cool and calm, responding politely to the questions put to him and himself recounting, with modest, natural grace, some of his adventures abroad.",CO006CL10
5880,135,"An idea occurred to me. Was he really the mysterious man of the theater and the letter? He seemed so at first, but I could have been wrong; I couldn’t precisely recall that other man’s features, and while it seemed to me that the two creatures were one and the same, could the mistake be explained by some miraculous resemblance?",CO006CL10
5881,136,"As I pondered this, time passed, and the conversation continued as if I were not there. Tea was served. Afterward, there was more singing and playing. Emílio listened with almost devout attention and revealed himself to be a man of taste as well as a discreet and attentive conversationalist.",CO006CL10
5882,137,"By the end of the evening, he had captivated everyone. My husband was particularly thrilled. He clearly considered himself fortunate to have found a new friend for himself, and another guest for our family gatherings.",CO006CL10
5883,138,"Emílio left, promising to return.",CO006CL10
5884,139,"When I was alone with my husband, I asked him:",CO006CL10
5885,140,“Where did you meet that man?”,CO006CL10
5886,141,"“He’s a real gem, isn’t he? He was introduced to me at the office a few days ago, and I immediately took a shine to him. He seems to be a good-hearted fellow, plus he’s bright, discreet, and sensible. Everyone likes him . . .”",CO006CL10
5887,142,"And, seeing me so serious and silent, he broke off and asked:",CO006CL10
5888,143,“Was I wrong to bring him here?”,CO006CL10
5889,144,"“Wrong? No, why?”",CO006CL10
5890,145,"“No reason. After all, what could possibly be wrong about inviting him? He’s such a distinguished young man . . .”",CO006CL10
5891,146,I brought this new hymn of praise to an end by summoning a slave to whom I gave some orders.,CO006CL10
5892,147,Then I withdrew to my room.,CO006CL10
5893,148,"My sleep that night was not, believe me, the sleep of the just. What irritated me most was the nervous state I got into after these events. I could no longer entirely brush aside these feelings; they happened against my will, overwhelming me and dragging me with them. It was a curiosity of the heart, which is the first sign of the storms to which our lives and our futures succumb.",CO006CL10
5894,149,"I felt as if that man could read my very soul and knew how to choose his moment, a moment when he would be most likely to impress himself on my imagination as an imposing, poetic figure. You, who met him later on, would you not say that, given the circumstances, he did this in order to make an impression on the mind of a woman like me?",CO006CL10
5895,150,"Like me, I say. My circumstances were rather special; I may never have spoken to you openly about this, but I’m sure you suspected as much.",CO006CL10
5896,151,"Had I been a wife to my husband and had he been a husband to me, I would have been perfectly safe. This was not the case. We entered our marital home like two travelers, perfect strangers, entering an inn, where the wild weather and the lateness of the hour had obliged us to take shelter beneath the same roof.",CO006CL10
5897,152,"My marriage, then, was the result of calculation and convenience. Not that I blame my parents. They wanted me to be happy and they died convinced that I was.",CO006CL10
5898,153,"I could, despite everything, have found in the husband they gave me an object of happiness for the rest of my days. All I would have needed was for my husband to see in me a twin soul, a kindred spirit. This did not happen. My husband saw marriage as most people do: as a way of obeying the Lord’s command in Genesis.",CO006CL10
5899,154,"Apart from that, he was always considerate and slept peacefully in the belief that he had done his duty.",CO006CL10
5900,155,"Duty! That was my lifeline. I knew that passions did not reign supreme and that our will can triumph over them. In this respect, I was strong enough to repel malevolent thoughts. However, it was not the present that I found so suffocating, so terrifying, it was the future. Up until then, that romance had held a certain sway over my imagination because of the mystery surrounding it; reality, however, would open my eyes. I found consolation in the hope that I would triumph over a guilty love, but in that future, whose proximity I could not gauge, would I be entirely able to resist passion and maintain intact my reason and my conscience? That was the question.",CO006CL10
5901,156,"In the midst of all these vacillations, I did not once see my husband reach out his hand to save me. On the contrary, when he found me in the act of burning that letter, and I flung myself into his arms, he, as you will remember, rather abruptly pushed me away.",CO006CL10
5902,157,This is what I thought and felt during the long night that followed Emílio’s introduction into our house.,CO006CL10
5903,158,"The following day, I woke, feeling weary of heart, but, whether out of inertia or exhaustion, I felt all these painful, tormenting thoughts vanish in the morning light, like real birds of night and solitude.",CO006CL10
5904,159,A bright light illumined my thoughts. It was a repetition of the same idea that kept coming back to me in the midst of all those recent anxieties.,CO006CL10
5905,160,"Why be afraid? I told myself. I’m such a sad, fearful creature; and I wear myself out creating mountains, only to collapse, exhausted, in the middle of a vast plain. No obstacle stands in my path as virtuous, rational wife. This man, if he is the same one, is merely a gullible reader of realist novels. It’s only the mystery that makes him interesting; seen from closer to, he’s sure to be either vulgar or vile.",CO006CL10
5906,161,IV,CO006CL10
5907,162,"I won’t weary you with a detailed, daily account of events.",CO006CL10
5908,163,"Emílio continued to visit our house, always behaving with the same delicacy and gravity, and charming everyone with his genuinely amiable manner, which managed to be distinguished without being affected.",CO006CL10
5909,164,I don’t know why my husband was so enthusiastic about this new friendship. Emílio had managed to awaken in him a new enthusiasm for me and for everyone. What caprice of Nature was this?,CO006CL10
5910,165,"I often questioned my husband about this very sudden, very public friendship; I tried to plant suspicions in his mind, but he would not be moved.",CO006CL10
5911,166,"“What do you want me to say?” he would answer. “I don’t know why I like the fellow so much. I just think he’s a really fine person, and I can’t conceal how much I enjoy his company.”",CO006CL10
5912,167,"“But you don’t even know him,” I would object.",CO006CL10
5913,168,"“Now, really! I’ve heard only excellent things about him, and besides, you can see at once that he’s a person of distinction.”",CO006CL10
5914,169,“Manners can be very deceiving.”,CO006CL10
5915,170,“So they say . . .”,CO006CL10
5916,171,"I confess, my friend, that I could have forced my husband to exclude Emílio, but when this idea came into my head, for some reason I laughed at my fears and declared myself strong enough to resist whatever might happen.",CO006CL10
5917,172,"Moreover, Emílio’s behavior encouraged me to lay down my arms. He treated me with utter respect, as he did all the other women, and never once revealed an ulterior motive, some secret thought.",CO006CL10
5918,173,"And the inevitable happened. Given his behavior toward me, I could hardly maintain my rigorous indifference to his friendly approaches.",CO006CL10
5919,174,"Things evolved in such a way that I even persuaded myself that everything that had happened before had nothing whatsoever to do with him, and the only connection between the two men was a truly remarkable resemblance, which, of course, I could not confirm, because, as I said before, I had been unable to look closely at the man in the theater.",CO006CL10
5920,175,"It did not take long for us to become close friends, and I was for him what all the other women were: admiring and admired.",CO006CL10
5921,176,"Emílio began to visit not only in the evenings, but during the day, too, at times when my husband was at home, and, later, even when he wasn’t.",CO006CL10
5922,177,"My husband had usually been the one to bring him to our house, but, at other times, Emílio came in his own carriage, which he himself drove with tremendous grace and elegance. He spent hours and hours at our home, playing the piano and talking.",CO006CL10
5923,178,"I must admit that the first time I received him alone, I trembled, but there was no need for such childish fear; Emílio never behaved in a way that confirmed my suspicions. If I still harbored any suspicions, they all melted away.",CO006CL10
5924,179,Two months passed.,CO006CL10
5925,180,"One afternoon, I was alone at home; I was waiting for you so that we could go and visit your ailing father. A carriage stopped outside the door. I sent a servant to see who it was. It was Emílio.",CO006CL10
5926,181,I received him as I always did.,CO006CL10
5927,182,"I told him we were going to visit your father, and he immediately said that he would leave. I urged him to wait until you arrived, and he did so as if some reason other than politeness kept him there.",CO006CL10
5928,183,Half an hour passed.,CO006CL10
5929,184,We talked about banal subjects.,CO006CL10
5930,185,"Then, during a brief silence, Emílio got up and went to the window. I stood up as well and walked over to the piano to fetch my fan. When I returned to the sofa, I saw in the mirror that Emílio was looking at me in a very strange way. It was a complete transformation. It was as if his whole soul lay in that gaze.",CO006CL10
5931,186,I shuddered.,CO006CL10
5932,187,"I nevertheless made an effort to control myself and sat down again, looking very serious.",CO006CL10
5933,188,Emílio came over to me.,CO006CL10
5934,189,I looked up at him.,CO006CL10
5935,190,His gaze had not changed.,CO006CL10
5936,191,I looked down.,CO006CL10
5937,192,“Are you frightened?” he asked.,CO006CL10
5938,193,"I said nothing, but began to tremble again, and my heart was pounding so wildly I thought it might leap from my breast.",CO006CL10
5939,194,"Those words contained the same expression as his eyes, and they had the same effect on me as the words in his letter.",CO006CL10
5940,195,“Are you frightened?” he said again.,CO006CL10
5941,196,"“Of what?” I asked, trying to smile in order to lighten the situation.",CO006CL10
5942,197,“You looked frightened.”,CO006CL10
5943,198,A silence.,CO006CL10
5944,199,"“Dona Eugênia,” he said, sitting down. “I can no longer hide the secret that has been tormenting me. It would be a pointless sacrifice. Whether it makes me happy or not, I prefer to know where I stand. Dona Eugênia, I love you.”",CO006CL10
5945,200,"I cannot begin to describe my feelings on hearing those words. I felt myself turn pale, and my hands were like ice. I tried to speak, but I couldn’t.",CO006CL10
5946,201,Emílio went on:,CO006CL10
5947,202,"“Oh, I know the risk I’m taking. I can see this is a forbidden love. But what can I do? It’s fate. I’ve traveled many leagues, seen so many beauties, and yet my heart never once beat faster. Fate has reserved for me a rare good fortune or, perhaps, a terrible misfortune, that of being loved or spurned by you. I bow to destiny. I will accept whatever answer you give me. What do you say?”",CO006CL10
5948,203,"While he was talking, I was able, as I listened, to consider my response. When he finished, I looked up and said:",CO006CL10
5949,204,“What answer do you expect from me?”,CO006CL10
5950,205,“Anything.”,CO006CL10
5951,206,“You can expect only one . . .”,CO006CL10
5952,207,“That you don’t love me?”,CO006CL10
5953,208,"“I cannot and do not love you, nor would I love you if I could or if I wanted to. Please leave.”",CO006CL10
5954,209,And with that I stood up.,CO006CL10
5955,210,Emílio did the same.,CO006CL10
5956,211,"“I will leave,” he said, “but I leave with all the fires of hell burning in my heart.”",CO006CL10
5957,212,I shrugged as if this were a matter of indifference to me.,CO006CL10
5958,213,"“Oh, I know you don’t care. That is what most pains me. I would much prefer your hatred, for, believe me, indifference is the worst possible punishment. However, I will resign myself to it. Such a grave crime should bring with it an equally grave punishment.”",CO006CL10
5959,214,"And, picking up his hat, he came over to me again.",CO006CL10
5960,215,I stepped back.,CO006CL10
5961,216,"“Oh, don’t be afraid. Do I make you afraid?”",CO006CL10
5962,217,“Afraid?” I retorted proudly.,CO006CL10
5963,218,“Or is it disgust?” he asked.,CO006CL10
5964,219,"“Perhaps,” I murmured.",CO006CL10
5965,220,"“Just one question,” he said. “Do you still have that letter?”",CO006CL10
5966,221,"“Ah,” I said, “so it was you who wrote that letter.”",CO006CL10
5967,222,“It was. And I was the mysterious stranger at the theater too. And the letter?”,CO006CL10
5968,223,“I burned it.”,CO006CL10
5969,224,“Just as I thought.”,CO006CL10
5970,225,"And, bowing coldly, he walked to the door. He had almost reached it, when I saw him hesitate and press one hand to his heart.",CO006CL10
5971,226,"I felt a moment of pity, but regardless of whether he was suffering or not, he had to leave. Nevertheless, I took a step toward him and, from a safe distance, asked:",CO006CL10
5972,227,“Would you tell me something?”,CO006CL10
5973,228,He stopped and turned around.,CO006CL10
5974,229,“Of course.”,CO006CL10
5975,230,“How could you have pretended to be my husband’s friend?”,CO006CL10
5976,231,"“It was an unworthy act, I know, but my love is such that it does not even recoil from such unworthy behavior. It’s the only love I know. But, forgive me, I will trouble you no further. Goodbye. Forever!”",CO006CL10
5977,232,And he left.,CO006CL10
5978,233,I thought I heard a sob.,CO006CL10
5979,234,"I went and sat down on the sofa. Shortly afterward, there was the sound of a carriage moving off down the street.",CO006CL10
5980,235,"I don’t know how the time between his departure and your arrival passed, but you found me in that same place.",CO006CL10
5981,236,"Up until then, I had only read about love. That man seemed to feel the love I’d dreamed of and read about. The idea that Emílio’s heart was, at that moment, bleeding, aroused in me an intense feeling of pity. Pity was the first step.",CO006CL10
5982,237,"I thought: “Who knows what he might be suffering now? And, after all, it’s not his fault. He loves me, he told me so; his love is stronger than reason itself. He is clearly utterly devoted, so much so that he opened his heart to me. He loves me, that is his excuse.”",CO006CL10
5983,238,"Then I went over all his words in my mind and tried to recall the tone in which he had spoken them. I remembered, too, what I’d said and the tone in which I’d responded to his confession of love.",CO006CL10
5984,239,"Perhaps I had been too harsh. I could have maintained my dignity without opening a wound in his heart. If I’d spoken more gently, I might have gained his respect and veneration. Now he will still love me, but he will only remember what happened with a sense of bitterness.",CO006CL10
5985,240,I was still immersed in these thoughts when you came in.,CO006CL10
5986,241,"Do you remember commenting on how sad I looked and asking me why? I didn’t answer. We went to your father’s house, but my sad mood remained.",CO006CL10

6092,347,“A love that stops to think is not true love.”,CO006CL10
6093,348,I said nothing. Emílio had spoken these words so scornfully and so woundingly that I felt my heart begin to pound and the blood rush to my face.,CO006CL10
6094,349,The excursion ended badly.,CO006CL10
6095,350,"After that scene, Emílio grew very cold toward me, which hurt me. I tried to go back to how things had been before, but failed.",CO006CL10

6109,364,“What’s this?” I said. “Can’t you see you’re making me cry too?”,CO006CL10
6110,365,"He looked at me, his eyes brimming with tears. My eyes, too, were moist.",CO006CL10
6111,366,"“Goodbye,” he said suddenly. “I’m leaving.”",CO006CL10

6115,370,"“I’ll stay, Eugênia!”",CO006CL10
6116,371,"We heard a noise outside. I went to see what it was. It was my husband, who had returned home feeling ill. He had suffered some kind of attack or fainting fit at the office. When he came around, he had still felt very unwell. Some friends had brought him back in a cab.",CO006CL10
6117,372,I ran to the door. My husband looked disheveled and deathly pale. He could only barely walk with the help of his friends.,CO006CL10
6118,373,I was so shocked that I forgot everything else. The doctor who had accompanied my husband immediately prescribed some medication. I was anxious and kept asking everyone if my husband would be all right.,CO006CL10
6119,374,They all assured me that he would.,CO006CL10
6120,375,Emílio seemed cast down by these events. He went over to my husband and squeezed his hand.,CO006CL10

6130,385,"When I received this fateful news, I almost lost my mind. He was still my husband, Carlota, and, despite all, I could not forget that he had been my companion in life and the one safe haven during all my emotional storms.",CO006CL10
6131,386,"Finding me in this state of despair, Emílio tried to console me. I made no attempt to conceal from him what a great blow my husband’s death would be.",CO006CL10
6132,387,"One night, we were all together, me, my cousin Elvira, one of my husband’s relatives, and Emílio. We were keeping the patient company. After a long silence, my husband turned to me and said:",CO006CL10
6133,388,“Give me your hand.”,CO006CL10
6134,389,"And, squeezing my hand hard, he turned his face to the wall, and died.",CO006CL10
6135,390,FOUR MONTHS PASSED. Emílio shared my grief and was a faithful presence at all the funeral ceremonies held for my late husband.,CO006CL10

6139,394,In my letter I said:,CO006CL10
6140,395,"Emílio: I understand that you are about to leave Rio. Is that possible? I myself could not believe my ears! You know how much I love you. Now is not the time to celebrate our vows, but it will not be long before the world will grant us the union our love demands. Come and see me and explain in person.",CO006CL10
6141,396,Your Eugênia.,CO006CL10

6145,400,"Four days later, I received the following letter:",CO006CL10
6146,401,"I lied, Eugênia. I’m leaving now. I told you a further lie. I will not be coming back. I won’t come back because I can’t. Marriage to you would be my ideal of happiness were I not a man whose habits make him entirely unsuited for marriage. Goodbye. Forgive me, and wish me a safe journey. Goodbye. Emílio.",CO006CL10
6147,402,"You can easily imagine my feelings on reading that letter. It was like a whole castle crumbling into rubble. This was the reward I received for my love, my first love: ingratitude and scorn. It was only right: such a guilty love should not end well; I was being punished by the consequences of my crime.",CO006CL10
6148,403,"I wondered, though, how that man, who seemed so deeply in love with me, could reject a woman whose honesty he could guarantee, given that she had resisted the wishes of her own heart. This seemed to me a complete mystery. Now I see that there was nothing mysterious about it: Emílio was a vulgar seducer, and all that distinguished him from the others was that he was slightly more adept.",CO006CL10
6149,404,"That is my story. You can imagine how I have suffered over these last two years. Time, though, is a great healer, and I am now cured.",CO006CL10

The essence of conjugal fidelity is in the blood of the dove, of vanity in peacocks… In sum, the gods put the essence of all human capacities and feelings into the beasts of the earth, water and air.

The ship was bound for Alexandria with its precious cargo of two philosophers, who were carrying the fruits of their enlightened philosophy to that cradle of learning. They were friends, both widowers and in their fifties. They especially cultivated metaphysics, but they were also acquainted with physics, chemistry, medicine and music; one of them, Stroibus, had become an excellent anatomist, having read Herophilus’s treatises on the subject many times.",CO121CL04

On the contrary, it despised them; some young men went so far as to laugh at them in the street. This, however, was not their motive for leaving their homeland. One day, Pythias, on his return from a journey, proposed to his friend that they should go to Alexandria, where the arts and sciences were held in great esteem. Stroibus agreed, and they embarked. Only now, once they were at sea, did the inventor of the new doctrine expound it to his friend, along with all his recent speculations and experiments.",CO121CL04

6270,53,"“I will demonstrate that it is not only possible, but legitimate and necessary. The prisons of Egypt are full of criminals, and criminals occupy a very lowly rung on the human ladder. They are no longer citizens and cannot even call themselves men, because in violating law and morality they have lost both reason and virtue, which are the two principal human characteristics. Furthermore, given that they must atone for their crimes through death, is it not fair that they should render some service to truth and to science? Truth is immortal; it is worth not only all the mice in the universe, but also all the wrongdoers.”",CO121CL10
6271,54,"Ptolemy could find no fault with this reasoning, and ordered the criminals to be delivered to Herophilos and his disciples. The great anatomist thanked him for such an illustrious favor, and began dissecting the culprits. The populace was horrified, but, apart from a few verbal protests, there were no public demonstrations against the measure. Herophilos repeated what he had said to Ptolemy, adding that subjecting delinquents to anatomical experiments even amounted to an indirect method of promoting morality, since fear of the scalpel would, in itself, deter the commission of many crimes.",CO121CL10
6272,55,"Upon coming out of prison, none of the criminals suspected the scientific destiny that awaited them. They left prison one by one, or sometimes in twos or threes. Many of them, stretched out and strapped to the operating table, still suspected nothing; they assumed it was some new method of summary execution. Only when the anatomists had decided upon the day’s scientific objective, lifted their scalpels, and made the first incisions, did the poor wretches become truly conscious of their predicament. Those who remembered hearing about the experiments on mice suffered doubly, because their imaginations added past events to present pain.",CO121CL10
6273,56,"In order to reconcile the interests of science with the impulses of compassion, the prisoners were not dissected within sight of each other, but one after the other. When they came in twos or threes, those waiting their turn were placed where they could not hear the other patient’s screams. Although the screams were often muffled with various devices, they weren’t entirely suppressed, and, in certain cases, the whole purpose of the experiment required unhindered vocal expression. Sometimes the experiments were simultaneous, but, in those cases, they were performed a suitable distance apart.",CO121CL10
6274,57,"Around fifty prisoners had been dissected when it came to Stroibus’s and Pythias’s turn. When brought out of prison, they presumed they were to be executed, and commended themselves to the gods. On the way they stole some figs, and justified this theft by pleading hunger; farther on, however, they purloined a flute, and for this they were unable to give a satisfactory explanation. Still, a thief’s cunning knows no bounds, and, to justify his action, Stroibus tried to get some notes out of the instrument, filling the bystanders with compassion, for they were not unaware of the fate awaiting the two philosophers. News of these two new offenses was reported by Herophilos, and shocked all of his disciples.",CO121CL10

6276,59,"The other point was to find out whether the seat of larceny lay in the palm of the hand or the tips of the fingers; this problem had been suggested by one of the disciples. Stroibus was the first to be experimented upon. He understood everything from the moment he entered the operating theater; and, as human nature has a very base, obsequious streak, he begged them humbly to spare the life of a philosopher. But Herophilos, with his great powers of dialectic, said to him something along these lines:",CO121CL10
6277,60,"“Either you are an impostor, or you’re the real Stroibus. In the first instance, you have here before you the only means of atoning for the crime of deceiving an enlightened ruler, so submit yourself to the scalpel. In the second instance, you must not be unaware that the philosopher’s duty is to serve philosophy, and that, compared to knowledge, the body is nothing.”",CO121CL10
6278,61,"Having said this, they began with their experiment on the hands, which produced excellent results that were collated in books later lost with the fall of the Ptolemies. The hands of Pythias were also torn apart and minutely examined. The wretched pair screamed, wept, and begged for mercy, but Herophilos again calmly reminded them that the philosopher’s duty is to serve philosophy, and that, for scientific purposes, they were worth even more than the mice, since it was infinitely better to draw conclusions about humans from humans, rather than from mice.",CO121CL10

On the third day, he plucked out their eyes, so as to disprove in practice a theory regarding the internal structure of that particular organ. I won’t go into the removal of both men’s stomachs, for it involved issues that were of somewhat secondary importance and which, in any event, had already been studied and resolved in five or six individuals dissected previously.",CO121CL10

That day – a Monday in May – I lingered for a moment in the Rua da Princesa to see where I might go and play that morning, I hesitated between Diogo hill and the Campo de Sant’ana, which wasn’t yet the polite park it is today, but a more or less infinite rustic space, full of washerwomen, grass and loose donkeys. The hill or the Campo? That was the problem. Suddenly I said to myself that school was the best notion. I made my way towards school. Here’s the reason.",CO144CL04

He was an old employee of the Arsenal, severe and intolerant. He dreamed of an important position in commerce for me, and wanted me to get the elements of bookkeeping, reading, writing and arithmetic, so I could get work as a cashier. He cited names of rich men who’d begun serving behind the counter. So it was the memory of the latest punishment that took me to school that morning. Virtue wasn’t my strong suit.",CO144CL04

He came in with his usual soft step, his leather slippers, a light canvas jacket, washed and faded, white trousers and a big floppy collar. His name was Policarpo and he was around fifty years of age, or more. He sat down, extracted a snuffbox and a red handkerchief from his jacket and put them in a drawer; then he cast his eyes around the room. The boys, who had stood up as he entered, sat down again. All was in order; work began.",CO144CL04

Raimundo took two hours to learn what took others only thirty or fifty minutes; that was his way of mastering what his brain couldn’t take in straight away.

A scruple that will be easily understood also prevents me from saying I was one of the most intelligent, but that’s my firm conviction. Be it noted that I wasn’t pallid or frail: I had a good complexion and good strong muscles. In the writing lessons, for example, I always finished before the others, but I filled the time drawing noses or carving them on the desk – not a noble or profound occupation I admit, but innocent, none the less.",CO144CL04
6290,10,"That day was like any other; as soon as I’d finished, I started drawing the master’s nose, giving it five or six different expressions, of which I recall the interrogative, the appreciative, the dubitative, and the meditative. Poor beginner in the art of letters that I was, I didn’t give them these names; but instinctively I gave them these expressions. Slowly, the others finished; the time came for me to finish too, give my work in and go back to my place.",CO144CL04

Now I was a prisoner, I was dying to be outside, and thought back to the hill and the Campo, and the other idle kids, Chico Telha, Américo, Carlos das Escadinhas, the cream of the neighbourhood and of the human race. Just to complete my despair, through the school windows, in the clear blue sky, above Livramento hill, I saw a paper kite, a big one high up in the sky, attached to an endless string, billowing in the wind, a wonderful sight.

I confess I was beginning to burn with curiosity. I glanced at Curvelo – it looked as if he was watching. It might be simple vague curiosity, a natural lack of discretion; but there might be something between them. This Curvelo was a mischievous rascal. He was eleven, older than us.",CO144CL04

But we were cunning too; we stuck our noses in our books, and went on reading. Finally he gave up, and picked up the daily papers, three or four of them, which he read slowly, chewing over his ideas and his emotions. Don’t forget we were at the end of Regency, and public excitement was running high. Policarpo certainly supported some party or other, but I could never find out which. The worst thing he could threaten us with was the palmatória, a piece of wood with holes drilled in its flat, round end.",CO144CL04

All he had to do was lift his hand, take it down and wield it with his usual vigour, which was considerable. Then again, maybe his political emotions sometimes took over to the point of sparing us some punishment or other. That day, at any rate, it seemed he was reading the papers with interest; he lifted his eyes from time to time, took a pinch of snuff, and went back to the papers, devouring them with a passion.",CO144CL04

Then he proposed a deal, an exchange of services; he’d give me the coin, and I would explain a passage in the syntax lesson. He couldn’t remember a thing from the book, and he was afraid of his father. He concluded the proposal by rubbing the little silver coin on his knees …",CO144CL04
6318,38,"I felt a strange sensation. It wasn’t that I had an idea of virtue more appropriate to a grown man; nor was I averse to telling a few childish lies. Both of us knew how to trick the master. The novelty was in the terms of the proposal, the exchange of lesson and money, an overt, explicit deal – you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours; that was the cause of the sensation. I stared at him aimlessly, unable to say a word.",CO144CL04

All that was left was to provide the service, tell him the answer, and I took no time doing it, nor did I give the wrong answer, at least consciously; I passed the explanation over on a scrap of paper which he took carefully, paying close attention.

I won’t say, out of misgivings that are easy to understand and generate an excellent stylistic effect, that I was one of the smartest, too, but such was my firm belief. Let it be noted that I was neither pale nor timid: I had a fine complexion and muscles of steel. In the handwriting exercises, for example, I always finished before everybody else, but I would stay where I was, drawing noses on paper or on the desk, a pastime neither noble nor intellectual, though unsophisticated in any event.",CO144CL08
6365,10,"That day was no different; as soon as I finished, I started drawing the schoolmaster’s nose, giving it five or six different expressions, of which I remember the interrogative, the marveling, the doubtful, and the cogitative. I didn’t give them those names, poor learner of reading and writing that I was, but instinctively I gave them those looks. The others were finishing, too; I had no choice but to finish as well, turn in the paper, and return to my seat.",CO144CL08
6366,11,"To be frank, I was regretting having come. Now that I was captive, I was dying to go outside, and I was recalling the morro and the Campo, thinking about the other idling boys, Chico Telha, Américo, Carlos das Escadrinhas, the cream of the neighborhood and of humankind. To make things even worse, through the school windows, in the clear blue of the sky, above the morro do Livramento, I saw a long and wide paper kite, tied to a lengthy string, flying through the air, a magnificent sight. And here I was at school, sitting down, my legs together, with the reader and the grammar book on my knees.",CO144CL08
6367,12,"“It was stupid of me to come,” I said to Raimundo.",CO144CL08
6368,13,"“Don’t say that,” he muttered.",CO144CL08
6369,14,"I took a look at him; he was paler. I remembered then that he wanted to ask me something, and I asked him what it was. Raimundo trembled again and very quickly told me to wait; it was something unusual.",CO144CL08
6370,15,"“Seu Pilar,” he muttered a few minutes later.",CO144CL08

6372,17,“You. . . .”,CO144CL08
6373,18,“You what?”,CO144CL08
6374,19,"He took a look at his father and then at a few other boys. One of them, Curvelo, was looking at him distrustfully, and Raimundo, pointing that look out to me, asked for another few minutes. I glanced at Curvelo and saw that he seemed to be alert; it could have been mere idle curiosity, natural indiscretion, but it could also have been something between the two of them. This Curvelo was a bit of a rapscallion. He was eleven years old; he was older than us.",CO144CL08
6375,20,"What did Raimundo want from me? I was still restless, fidgeting a lot, telling him in a whisper, with urgency, that he should tell me what he wanted, that nobody was paying him or me any mind. Or later, that afternoon. . . .",CO144CL08
6376,21,"“Not this afternoon,” he interrupted me; “it can’t be in the afternoon.”",CO144CL08

6378,23,“Father is watching.”,CO144CL08
6379,24,"As it turned out, the schoolmaster had his eye on us. As he was stricter with his son, he often sought him with his gaze to make sure he was even more beaten down. But we, too, were crafty; we stuck our noses in our books and went on reading. In the end, he got tired and picked up the day’s newspapers, three or four, which he read slowly, mulling over the ideas and the passions expressed in them. Don’t forget that we were coming to the end of the regency then and that there was a lot of public unrest. Policarpo certainly took one side or another, but I could never figure out which. But for us the worst thing he could take was the paddle.",CO144CL08
6380,25,"And there it was, hanging from the window frame, to the right, with its five cursed holes. All it took was lifting a hand, unhooking it, and wielding it with his usual strength, which was not insubstantial. And so it may be that political passions enthralled him to such a degree that we got out of a punishment or two. That day at least it seemed to me he was reading the newspapers with great interest; he looked up now and then, or he took a pinch of snuff, but then he went straight back to the papers, and he read in earnest.",CO144CL08
6381,26,After a while—ten or twelve minutes—Raimundo put his hand in his pants pocket and looked my way.,CO144CL08

It was a coin from the time of the king, worth twelve vinténs or two tostões, I don’t remember;[4] but it was a coin, and such a coin that it made the blood in my heart throb. Raimundo turned his pallid gaze on me and asked me if I wanted it for myself. I told him he was kidding, but he swore he wasn’t.",CO144CL08
6390,35,"“You don’t want to keep it, then?”",CO144CL08

6392,37,"My response, after taking a look at the schoolmaster’s desk, was to hold my hand covertly out. Raimundo pulled his hand back and made a pained contortion of the mouth that was meant to be a smile. Then he proposed a deal, an exchange of services. He would give me the coin if I explained part of the language lesson to him. He hadn’t gotten anything from the book, and he was afraid of his father. And he concluded the proposal by rubbing the coin on his knees. . . .",CO144CL08
6393,38,"I had a strange feeling. It isn’t that I had a notion of virtue more befitting that of a grown man; nor is it that it wasn’t easy for me to tell a white lie or two. Both of us knew how to deceive the schoolmaster. The novelty was in the terms of the proposal, in the exchange of classwork and money, a clear, positive purchase, this for that; such was the cause of my feeling. I went on looking at him to no purpose, unable to say anything.",CO144CL08
6394,39,"Let it be noted that the subject of the lesson was hard and that Raimundo, not having learned it, was resorting to a method that struck him as a good way to get out of being punished by his father. If he had asked me for help as a favor, he would have gotten it, as he had other times; but being reminded of the other times and the fear of finding my willingness sapped or spent and of not learning the way he wanted to—and it may even be that I taught him wrong at some point—were apparently the reasons for his proposal.",CO144CL08
6395,40,"The poor devil was counting on the favor, but he wanted to make sure it would be effective, and so he resorted to the coin that his mother had given him and that he was keeping like a relic or a toy; he took it and rubbed it over his knees, before my eyes, like a temptation. . . . Really, it was pretty, slender, white, very white; and for me, who had only a copper in my pocket, an ugly, thick, stained copper, when I had anything at all. . . .",CO144CL08
6396,41,"I didn’t want to take it, and I was having trouble refusing it. I glanced at the schoolmaster, who was still reading, with such interest the snuff was trickling from his nose.",CO144CL08
6397,42,"“Come on, take it,” the son whispered to me. And the coin sparkled in his fingers as if it were a diamond. . . .",CO144CL08
6398,43,"In truth, if the schoolmaster didn’t see anything, where was the problem? And there was no way he could see anything; he was clutching the papers, reading with passion, with indignation. . . .",CO144CL08
6399,44,"“Here, here.”",CO144CL08
6400,45,"I glanced around the classroom again and saw Curvelo’s gaze on us; I told Raimundo to wait. It seemed to me as if he were watching us, so I dissembled; but a little later I took another look at him and—such illusions desire causes!—didn’t see anything else. I took heart then.",CO144CL08
6401,46,“Give it here. . . .”,CO144CL08
6402,47,"Raimundo gave me the coin surreptitiously; I put it in my pants pocket with an excitement I can’t describe. Here it was, mine, hard by my leg. There was still the service to render, helping him with the assignment, and I didn’t put it off or do it badly, at least not consciously; I passed him the explanation on a little piece of paper that he took with caution and full of attention. You could sense the huge effort he expended to learn a trifle, but as long as he avoided punishment, everything would be all right.",CO144CL08
6403,48,"All at once, I took a look at Curvelo and shuddered; he had his eyes on us, and he was smiling in a way that struck me as malicious. I pretended nothing was happening, but a little later, on taking another glance at him, I found him the same way, with the same look, and to boot he was starting to fidget impatiently in his seat. I smiled at him and he didn’t smile; on the contrary, he knitted his brow, which gave him a threatening look. My heart pounded.",CO144CL08
6404,49,"“We need to be very careful,” I said to Raimundo.",CO144CL08
6405,50,"“Tell me just this bit,” he whispered.",CO144CL08
6406,51,"I gestured for him to be quiet; but he insisted, and the coin, there in my pocket, reminded me of the bargain we had struck. Very sneakily, I showed him what he wanted; then I looked again at Curvelo, who seemed to me even more restless, and his smile, malicious before, was worse still.",CO144CL08
6407,52,"It goes without saying that I, too, was worked up, eager for class to be over, but the clock wasn’t moving the way it usually did and the schoolmaster was paying us no mind; he was reading the papers, one article after the next, punctuating them with harrumphs, with moves of his shoulders, with a tap or two on the table. And outside, in the blue sky, above the morro, the same eternal kite, flying from side to side, as if it were calling me to go join it.",CO144CL08
6408,53,"I pictured myself there with the books and the slate, beneath the mango tree, and in my pants pocket the coin, which I wouldn’t give to anyone for anything in the world; I would keep it at home, telling mother I’d found it in the street. To keep it from slipping away on me, I kept touching it, running my fingers over the relief, as if trying to read the inscription by feel, badly tempted to look at it.",CO144CL08
6409,54,“Ah! Seu Pilar!” called out the schoolmaster in a booming voice.,CO144CL08
6410,55,"I shuddered as if I were waking from a dream and stood up quickly. I found the schoolmaster, frowning, the papers scattered, looking in my direction, and Curvelo standing up by the desk. I understood everything.",CO144CL08
6411,56,“Come here!” shouted the schoolmaster.,CO144CL08
6412,57,"I went and stopped in front of him. He bore into my conscience with a pair of beady eyes; then he called over his son. The entire class had stopped; no one was reading anymore; no one made the slightest movement. I, even though I didn’t take my eyes from the schoolmaster, sensed everyone’s curiosity and dread.",CO144CL08

6416,61,"I didn’t obey right away, but I couldn’t deny anything. I went on shaking. Policarpo shouted at me to give him the coin again, and I didn’t hold out any longer; I put my hand slowly in my pocket, took it out, and gave it to him. He took a close look at both sides of it, snorting with rage; he then held out his arm and threw it into the street. And at that point he gave us a helping of hard remarks, saying that both the son and I had just done something ugly, unworthy, low, an abomination, and that as a correction and an example we were going to be punished. Here he took the paddle.",CO144CL08
6417,62,"“Forgive me, senhor!” I whimpered.",CO144CL08

6421,66,"I gave him my right hand, then my left hand, and I took the whacks one after the other, until there were twelve of them, which left my palms red and swollen. The son’s turn came, and it was the same thing; he didn’t spare him anything—two, four, eight, twelve whacks. He finished; he gave us another lecture. He called us shameless, insolent, and swore that if we ever made that trade again he would give us such a punishment that we would remember it for the rest of our lives. And he shouted:",CO144CL08

6423,68,"I, for my part, was looking at the floor. I didn’t dare meet anyone’s gaze; I sensed all eyes on us. I went back to my seat, whimpering, getting lashed by the schoolmaster’s insults. Terror had taken hold of the classroom; I can say that no one would attempt a similar trade that day. I think Curvelo himself had been overcome by fear. I didn’t look at him right away, but I swore to myself I was going to kick his face in, in the street, after we got out, as sure as two plus three is five.",CO144CL08
6424,69,"A little later I looked him; he, too, was looking at me, but he turned away, and I think he went pale. He collected himself and started reading out loud. He began shifting, fidgeting for no reason, rubbing his knees, his nose. He may even have been sorry for telling on us; and why in fact did he tell on us? What is it we were taking from him?",CO144CL08
6425,70,“I’ll get you; you can be sure of it!” I was saying to myself.,CO144CL08
6426,71,"The time to leave came, and we left; he went ahead, in a rush, and I didn’t want to get into a fight right there, on Rua do Costa, by the school; it had to be on Rua Larga de São Joaquim. When I made it to the corner, though, I didn’t see him anymore; he had probably hidden in some passageway or shop; I went into a pharmacy, looked around a few other establishments, asked some people about him—no one gave me any news. That afternoon he was absent from school.",CO144CL08
6427,72,"At home, obviously, I didn’t say anything, but to account for my swollen hands I lied to my mother; I told her I hadn’t learned my assignment. I fell asleep that night sending both boys—the one of the betrayal and the one of the coin—to the devil. And I dreamed about the coin; I dreamed that on going back to school the next day I had found it in the street and that I’d grabbed it with neither fear nor misgivings. . . .",CO144CL08
6428,73,"I woke up early in the morning. The thought of going to look for the coin made me get dressed quickly. The day was splendid, a May day, brilliant sunshine, mild air, not to mention the new pants my mother gave me, which, by the way, were yellow. All of this, and the coin. . . . I left the house as if I were going to ascend the throne of Jerusalem. I went at a swift gait so no one could get to school before me; even so, I didn’t go so quickly that my pants got wrinkled. No, because they sure were nice! I looked at them and avoided encounters, the garbage in the streets. . . .",CO144CL08
6429,74,"In the street I ran into a company from the marine battalion, drummer in the lead, beating his drum. I couldn’t listen and keep still. The soldiers, in formation, right, left, were stamping quickly, to the beat of the drum; they were coming, they went by me, and they went on their way. I felt an itch in my feet, and on impulse I set out after them. I’ve already told you: the day was nice, and, besides, the drum. . . . I looked both ways; finally—I don’t know how it happened—I, too, started marching to the beat of the drum, singing something, I think:",CO144CL08

I got back home with my pants all dirty, without the coin in my pocket or resentment in my heart. And yet the coin was pretty and it was they who had given me my first taste of corruption—Raimundo—and of betrayal—Curvelo; but the dickens of a drum. . . .",CO144CL08

6432,2,"THE SCHOOL WAS on Rua do Costa, a little two-story building with a wooden fence. The year was 1840. On that Monday in May, I hung around for a few moments on Rua da Princesa pondering where I would go and play that morning. I couldn’t decide between the São Diogo hill and the Campo de Sant’Ana, which, back then, was not the park for fine gentlemen we know today, but a more or less infinite expanse of countryside, dotted with washerwomen, patches of grass, and untethered donkeys. Hill or field? That was the question. Suddenly I told myself I’d be better off going to school. And so I went. Here’s why.",CO144CL10
6433,3,"I had skipped class twice the previous week, and when I was found out, I received my just reward from my father, who gave me a good thrashing with a big quince stick. The beating hurt for quite some time. He was a former employee at the War Arsenal, and was strict and intolerant. He dreamed of a successful business career for me, and was keen that I should master the rudiments of commerce, reading, writing, and arithmetic, in order to get me started somewhere as a cashier. He was always reeling off the names of successful businessmen who had started behind the counter. So it was the recollection of that most recent punishment that carried me to school that morning. I was not a virtuous child.",CO144CL10
6434,4,"I crept up the stairs so that the schoolmaster wouldn’t hear me, and arrived just in time; he entered the classroom three or four minutes later. He padded softly in as usual, wearing leather slippers, a faded linen jacket, ill-fitting white trousers, and a wide, drooping collar. His name was Policarpo and he was around fifty years of age, perhaps more. He sat down, took his snuffbox and red handkerchief from his inside jacket pocket and placed them in a drawer, then cast his eyes around the room. The boys, who had stood up when he entered, had sat down again. Everything was in order; work could begin.",CO144CL10
6435,5,"“I need to speak to you, Pilar,” the schoolmaster’s son whispered to me.",CO144CL10
6436,6,"He was called Raimundo, this little fellow, and although he studied hard, he was rather dim and slow-witted. It would take Raimundo two hours to grasp what others could master in thirty or fifty minutes; he overcame with time what his brain could not at first achieve. To this was added a great fear of his father. A delicate child with a pale, sickly face, he was rarely cheerful. He arrived at school after his father and left before him. His father was even stricter with him than he was with us.",CO144CL10

6438,8,"“Later,” he replied, his voice trembling.",CO144CL10
6439,9,"The writing lesson began. I hate to say that I was among the more advanced pupils in the school, but I was. And although an understandable and praiseworthy fastidiousness on my part makes me hesitate to say that I was also one of the most intelligent, I cannot deny it. It should be noted that I was neither pale nor sickly; I had a good complexion and muscles of iron. In the writing lesson, for example, I would always finish before everyone else, and would while away the time drawing noses either on a piece of paper or on the desk, an entirely foolish, ignoble occupation, but innocent enough nevertheless.",CO144CL10
6440,10,"That day was the same as any other; no sooner had I finished than I began to draw the schoolmaster’s nose, in five or six different poses, of which I remember the interrogative, the admirative, the dubitative, and the cogitative. I didn’t call them by these names, poor student of rudimentary letters that I was, but I instinctively gave them those expressions. One by one, the other pupils finished, and there was nothing for it but for me to finish, too, hand in my writing exercise, and return to my place.",CO144CL10
6441,11,"If truth be told, I was sorry I had come. Now that I was trapped there, I was aching to escape, and once again I thought of the field, the hill, and the other young rascals, Chico Telha, Américo, and Carlos das Escadinhas, the very flower of the neighborhood and of the human race itself. To compound my despair, through the schoolroom window, floating in the bright blue sky high above the Livramento hill, I could see a magnificent paper kite, long and broad, dancing in the breeze on a long string. And there was I sitting in the classroom, with my reading book and my grammar book on my knees.",CO144CL10

6443,13,"“Don’t say that,” he whispered back.",CO144CL10
6444,14,"I looked at him; he seemed even paler than before. Then I remembered that he wanted to ask me something, and I asked him what it was. Again Raimundo trembled and hurriedly told me to wait; it was a private matter.",CO144CL10

6449,19,"He glanced up at his father, then at some of the other boys. One of them, Curvelo, stared back at him suspiciously, and, indicating this with a nod of his head, Raimundo asked me to wait a few more minutes. I confess that, by this point, I was burning with curiosity. I looked at Curvelo and saw that he did seem to be watching us; it might have been mere curiosity, natural inquisitiveness, but it might also have been a sign that there was something between them. Curvelo was a mischievous devil. At eleven he was the oldest in the class.",CO144CL10
6450,20,"What on earth did Raimundo want from me? I was getting increasingly restless, fidgeting and whispering insistently to Raimundo that he should tell me what it was all about, and that no one was watching either of us. Or if he couldn’t tell me now, then maybe this afternoon—",CO144CL10
6451,21,"“No, not this afternoon,” he interrupted, “it can’t be this afternoon.”",CO144CL10

6453,23,“Papa is watching.”,CO144CL10
6454,24,"The schoolmaster was, indeed, staring at us. Since he was stricter with his own son, he often looked in his direction, the better to keep him under his thumb. But we could play at that game too; we stuck our noses in our books and carried on reading. Finally, he wearied of watching us and picked up one of three or four newspapers, which he proceeded to read slowly, chewing over the thoughts and passions therein. Don’t forget that this was the end of the Regency, and feelings were running high. Policarpo doubtless had some political affiliation, although I was never able to confirm what it was. His worst affiliation, from our point of view, was with the strap.",CO144CL10
6455,25,"There it hung, to the right of the window, with its five devilish eyes. He needed only to raise his hand, unhook the fiendish strap, and brandish it with his customary and not inconsiderable vigor. It was conceivable, however, that his interest in politics would so engage him that we would be spared any punishment. On that particular day, at any rate, he seemed to be reading the newspapers with particular relish; he raised his eyes from time to time, or took a pinch of snuff, but quickly returned to the papers, devouring them avidly.",CO144CL10
6456,26,After some time—ten or twelve minutes—Raimundo put his hand in his trouser pocket and looked at me.,CO144CL10

It was a coin from the days of the king, twelve vinténs or two tostões, I can’t quite remember which, but it was a coin nonetheless, and a coin that made my heart beat faster. Raimundo turned his insipid gaze on me, then asked if I wanted it. I said he must be joking, but he swore he wasn’t.",CO144CL10

He couldn’t remember anything from the book, and he was afraid of asking his father. He concluded his proposal by rubbing the coin on his knee.",CO144CL10

I sat staring at him, speechless.",CO144CL10
6469,39,"As you can imagine, the lesson was a difficult one, and Raimundo, having failed to learn it, was resorting to what seemed to him a useful means of escaping punishment by his father. If he had asked me as a favor, I would have helped him just the same, as I had on previous occasions, but it seems it was the memory of such previous occasions, the fear that I might be reluctant or unwilling to help, or else not explain things very well—and it may even be that on some occasions I had told him the wrong answer—it seems that this was the motivation behind his proposal.",CO144CL10

6472,42,"“Come on, take it,” the son whispered to me. And the little silver coin sparkled between his fingers like a diamond.",CO144CL10
6473,43,"If the schoolmaster didn’t notice, what possible harm could there be? And he would see nothing, for he had his nose buried in his newspapers, which he continued to read with fire and indignation.",CO144CL10
6474,44,"“Go on, take it . . .”",CO144CL10
6475,45,"I again glanced around the schoolroom, and saw that Curvelo was looking at us; I told Raimundo to wait. It seemed to me that Curvelo was watching, and so I pretended not to notice; but after a few seconds, I shot him another glance and—ah, how our desires delude us!—I saw he had turned away. My courage returned.",CO144CL10
6476,46,“Give it here.”,CO144CL10
6477,47,"Raimundo furtively passed me the coin; with an excitement I can barely describe I put it in my trouser pocket. There it was, pressed against my leg, all mine. It only remained for me to perform my side of the bargain by teaching him the lesson, and I lost no time at all in doing so. I didn’t even give him the wrong answers, at least not intentionally; I passed them to him on a scrap of paper, which he very cautiously took from me and gave his full attention. You could sense that he was expending five or six times the effort needed to learn something so simple, but it didn’t particularly matter, just as long as he escaped punishment.",CO144CL10
6478,48,"Suddenly I looked over at Curvelo and jumped; he was looking straight at us, with a malicious grin on his face. I pretended not to have seen this, but when I turned back toward him a few moments later, I saw that he was still looking, and had the same malicious air about him, in addition to which he was now fidgeting impatiently in his seat. I smiled at him, but he did not smile back; on the contrary, he frowned, which gave him a distinctly menacing appearance. My heart was racing.",CO144CL10
6479,49,"“We need to be very careful,” I said to Raimundo.",CO144CL10
6480,50,"“Just explain this bit here,” he whispered.",CO144CL10
6481,51,"I gestured to him to shut up, but he insisted, and the coin in my pocket reminded me of the contract between us. I gave him the answer, as surreptitiously as I could; then I turned to look at Curvelo, who was fidgeting even more, and the smile on his face, which had been wicked enough before, was now even more so.",CO144CL10
6482,52,"It goes without saying that I was desperate for the lesson to finish, but the hands on the clock seemed to be stuck and the schoolmaster wasn’t paying the slightest bit of attention to anything around him; he was still reading the newspapers, article by article, punctuating them with exclamations, shrugs, and one or two little taps on the table. And there outside, in the blue sky, above the hill, the same eternal kite swooped and swerved, as if calling me to go and join it.",CO144CL10
6483,53,"I imagined myself sitting there with my books and my slate beneath the mango tree, the little silver coin in my trouser pocket; I wouldn’t give it to anyone, not for anything in the world; I would keep it at home, telling my mother I’d found it in the street. I felt for it in my pocket, just to make sure it didn’t get away, running my fingers over its surface, almost reading the inscription by touch, and desperately wanting to peek at it.",CO144CL10
6484,54,"“Hey! Pilar!” shouted the schoolmaster, with a voice of thunder.",CO144CL10
6485,55,"I started as if woken from a dream and jumped to my feet. I found the schoolmaster scowling at me, the newspapers thrown to one side. Standing next to his desk was Curvelo. He seemed to have understood exactly what was going on.",CO144CL10
6486,56,"“Come here,” barked the schoolmaster.",CO144CL10
6487,57,"I went up and stood before him. He drilled into my mind with his pointy little eyes, then summoned his son. The whole class had stopped work; nobody was reading, nobody moved. I didn’t take my eyes off the schoolmaster, but I could sense everyone’s curiosity and fear.",CO144CL10
6488,58,"“So, you take money for teaching the other boys their lessons, do you, Pilar?”",CO144CL10
6489,59,“I . . .”,CO144CL10
6490,60,“Give me the coin that your chum over there gave you!” he shouted.,CO144CL10
6491,61,"I hesitated, but I couldn’t refuse. I was still trembling uncontrollably. Policarpo again bawled at me to give him the coin, and I had no choice; I reached into my pocket, slowly drew out the coin, and handed it over. He examined it carefully, snorting with rage; then he stretched out his arm and hurled it into the street. He laid into us with a tirade of abuse, about how both I and his son had committed a despicable, unworthy, vile, base act, and that we were to be punished both for our own sakes and to set an example. At this, he reached out and took the strap down from its hook.",CO144CL10
6492,62,"“I’m sorry, sir . . .” I sobbed.",CO144CL10
6493,63,“Sorry isn’t good enough! Hold out your hand! Hold it out! Come on! Shameless rascal! Hold out your hand!”,CO144CL10
6494,64,"“But, sir . . .”",CO144CL10
6495,65,“You’ll only make matters worse!”,CO144CL10
6496,66,"I held out my right hand, then the left, and I took the strokes one after the other, twelve in all, which left my palms red and swollen. Then it was his son’s turn and there was no sparing him, either; two, four, eight, twelve strokes. When he’d finished, he preached us another sermon, calling us insolent good-for-nothings, a disgrace to the school, and swore that if we did it again, the punishment would be so harsh we would remember it for the rest of our lives.",CO144CL10
6497,67,“Swine! Crooks! Swindlers!” he shouted.,CO144CL10
6498,68,"As for me, I just stared down at the floor. I didn’t dare look at anyone and I could feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on us. I returned to my seat, sobbing, bludgeoned by the schoolmaster’s insults. Fear stalked the classroom; I can assure you that no one would try the same thing that day. I believe even Curvelo was taken aback. I didn’t look at him straightaway, but I swore to myself that, as soon as we were outside in the street, I would smash his face in, just as sure as two plus three makes five.",CO144CL10
6499,69,"A little while later, I glanced over at him; he was looking at me, too, but instantly looked away, and I’m pretty sure he turned pale. He pulled himself together and began to read out loud; he was afraid, though. He began to move around, fidgeting distractedly, scratching his knees, rubbing his nose. Maybe he regretted telling on us; indeed, why had he done it? What had we ever done to him?",CO144CL10
6500,70,“You’ll pay for this! And how!” I muttered to myself.,CO144CL10
6501,71,"It was time to leave, and he hurried out ahead of me. I didn’t want to fight him right there in Rua do Costa, outside the school; it would have to be in Rua Larga de São Joaquim. However, when I reached the corner, there was no sign of him; he’d probably scuttled down some alley or gone into a shop; I went into an apothecary’s, peered into a few houses, and asked several people if they’d seen him, but no one could tell me anything. That afternoon, he skipped school.",CO144CL10
6502,72,"Obviously, at home, I said nothing, and to explain my swollen hands, I lied to my mother, telling her I hadn’t learned the lesson properly. As I fell asleep that night, I cursed both boys, the one with the coin and the blabbermouth. And I dreamed about the coin; I dreamed that when I went back to school the next day, I found it in the street and picked it up, without feeling a smidgen of fear or guilt . . .",CO144CL10
6503,73,"In the morning, I woke early. The idea of going to look for the coin prompted me to get dressed quickly. It was a splendid May morning, a day of glorious sunshine and gentle breezes, not to mention the pair of new trousers my mother gave me, which, by the way, were yellow. All this and the little silver coin . . . I left the house like a prince about to ascend the throne of Jerusalem. I quickened my pace so that no one would get to school before me, but not so fast that I would crease my new trousers. Oh, but they were smart! I gazed down at them and carefully avoided any chance contact with people or with the rubbish in the street.",CO144CL10
6504,74,"On my way, I met with a company of fusiliers, led by a drummer. When I heard the drumming, I just couldn’t keep still. The soldiers were marching briskly along in perfect time—left, right, left, right—with the sound of the drum; they approached, passed by, and carried on. I felt an itching in my feet and an urge to follow them. As I said, it was a beautiful day, and then there was that drum too . . . I looked both ways; finally, I’m not entirely sure how, I, too, began marching to the drumbeat, even humming some tune or other:",CO144CL10
6505,75,"“Rato na Casaca,” I believe. I didn’t go to school. I followed the fusiliers, then carried on down to Saúde, and ended the morning on the shore at Gamboa. I returned home with filthy trousers, and with no silver coin in my pocket and no resentment in my soul. Still, that little silver coin was very pretty and it was they, Raimundo and Curvelo, who had given me my first taste of corruption on the one hand, and betrayal on the other. And as for that naughty drum . . .",CO144CL10

10900,3,Chapter I,CO107CL12
10901,4,"THE MOST DIFFICULT THING in the world, apart from governing a country, must surely be that of guessing Dona Benedita’s exact age. Some said forty, some forty-five, others thirty-six. One stockbroker went as low as twenty-nine, but his judgment, clouded by hidden intentions, lacked the necessary stamp of sincerity that we all like to see in human opinions. Indeed, I only mention it to illustrate, from the very outset, that Dona Benedita was always the very model of good manners.",CO107CL12
10902,5,"The stockbroker’s flattery served only to arouse her indignation, albeit momentarily, yes, momentarily. As for those other estimates, oscillating between thirty-six and forty-five, none of them could be contradicted by Dona Benedita’s appearance, which was both maturely serious and youthfully graceful. The only surprising thing is that such speculation continued, when in order to know the truth one needed only to ask her.",CO107CL12
10903,6,"Dona Benedita reached her forty-second birthday on Sunday the nineteenth of September, 1869. At six o’clock in the evening, friends and relations, some twenty or twenty-five in number, are gathered around the family table. Many of them were also present at her birthday dinners of 1868, 1867, and 1866, and they have always heard their hostess’s age frankly alluded to. Moreover, there at the table, for all to see, are a young lady and a young master, her children; it is true that he, both in size and manners, is still somewhat boyish; on the other hand, the young lady, Eulália, is eighteen, although such is the severity of her manners and features that she looks twenty-one.",CO107CL12
10904,7,"The joviality of the guests, the excellence of the dinner, certain matrimonial negotiations entrusted to Canon Roxo (of which more shall be said anon), and the hostess’s generous nature, all these make for an intimate and happy affair. The canon stands up to carve the turkey. Dona Benedita has always abided by the custom in modest households of entrusting the turkey to one of the guests, instead of having it carved away from the table by servants, and the canon was the maestro of such solemn occasions.",CO107CL12
10905,8,"Nobody knew the bird’s anatomy better than he, nor how to wield the knife so nimbly. Perhaps—and this is a matter for the experts—perhaps his status as a canon gave to the carving knife, in the minds of the guests, a certain prestige, which would be lacking if, for example, he were a mere student of mathematics or an office clerk. On the other hand, would a student or scribe, without the lessons of long practice, have at their disposal the canon’s consummate art? That is another important question.",CO107CL12
10906,9,"As for the other guests, they are sitting and chatting; the gurgle of half-sated stomachs reigns, the laughter of nature on its way to repleteness; it is a moment of relaxation.",CO107CL12
10907,10,"Dona Benedita is talking, as are her visitors; however, she does not speak to all of them, but only to the one seated next to her. Her neighbor is a plump, kindly, cheerful lady, the mother of a twenty-one-year-old graduate, Leandrinho, who is sitting opposite them. Dona Benedita is not merely talking to the plump lady, she is clasping one of her hands, and not only is she clasping the plump lady’s hand, she is also looking at her with vivacious, lovestruck eyes.",CO107CL12
10908,11,"Note that hers is not a persistent or prolonged gaze, but rather a series of small, restless, momentary glances. In any event, there is much tenderness in that gesture, and even if there weren’t, nothing would be lost, because Dona Benedita repeats with her lips everything that her eyes have already said to Dona Maria dos Anjos: that she is absolutely delighted, that it is wonderful to meet her, that Dona Maria is so very kind, so very dignified, that her eyes are the very windows of her soul, and so on. One of her friends says jokingly to Dona Benedita that she is making her jealous.",CO107CL12
10909,12,"“Oh, stuff and nonsense!” she replies, laughing.",CO107CL12
10910,13,"And, turning back to the other woman:",CO107CL12
10911,14,“Don’t you agree? No one should come between us.”,CO107CL12
10912,15,"And she carried on showering her with compliments, courtesies, and smiles, the offers of more of this, more of that, plans to go on a trip together or perhaps to the theater, and promises of many visits, all spoken in such warm, effusive tones that her new companion was visibly throbbing with pleasure and gratitude.",CO107CL12
10913,16,"The turkey has been eaten. Dona Maria dos Anjos signals to her son, who stands up and asks them to accompany him in a toast:",CO107CL12
10914,17,"“Ladies and gentlemen, there is a saying in French: les absents ont tort. Let us resolutely reject this, and drink to someone who is far, far away in terms of space, but close, very close indeed, to the heart of his dear wife. Let us drink to that most illustrious judge, Justice Proença.”",CO107CL12
10915,18,"The toast did not receive an enthusiastic response from the assembled guests, and to understand why one need only look at the sad face of their hostess. Her closest friends and relatives whispered to one another that young Leandrinho had been very thoughtless indeed; they drank the toast, but refrained from cheering, so as not, it would seem, to exacerbate Dona Benedita’s suffering. In vain: Dona Benedita, unable to contain herself, burst into tears, got up from the table, and left the room. Dona Maria dos Anjos went with her. There then followed a deathly silence. Eulália begged them all to carry on as normal, saying that her mother would be back shortly.",CO107CL12
10916,19,"“Mama is very sensitive,” she said, “and the idea of Papa being so far away . . .”",CO107CL12
10917,20,"Dismayed, Leandrinho apologized to Eulália. The fellow sitting next to him explained that Dona Benedita could not hear her husband’s name mentioned without feeling a crushing blow to her heart, promptly followed by tears; Leandrinho replied that he was aware of her misfortune, but had never imagined his toast would have such a harmful effect.",CO107CL12
10918,21,"“And yet it’s the most natural thing in the world,” explained the fellow, “for she misses her husband terribly.”",CO107CL12
10919,22,"“The canon,” replied Leandrinho, “told me her husband went to Pará about two years ago.”",CO107CL12
10920,23,"“Two and a half years. He was appointed district judge by the Zacarias government. He would have preferred the appeal court in São Paulo, or perhaps Bahia, but it was not to be, and so he accepted Pará instead.”",CO107CL12
10921,24,“And he hasn’t been back since?”,CO107CL12
10922,25,“No.”,CO107CL12
10923,26,“I presume Dona Benedita is afraid of such a long sea voyage . . .”,CO107CL12
10924,27,"“I don’t believe so. She’s already been to Europe. No, if I recall correctly, she stayed behind in Rio to sort out some family affairs, and then stayed on, and on, and now . . .”",CO107CL12
10925,28,“But would it not have been far better to go to Pará than to suffer like this? Do you know her husband?”,CO107CL12
10926,29,"“I do; a very distinguished gentleman, and still hale and hearty; he couldn’t be more than forty-five. Tall, bearded, handsome. People used to say that he didn’t insist on his wife joining him because he had fallen for some widow up there.”",CO107CL12
10927,30,“Ah!”,CO107CL12
10928,31,"“And someone even came and told Dona Benedita. Imagine how the poor lady must have felt! She cried all night, and the next day she wouldn’t eat any breakfast, and made arrangements to take the very next steamship to Pará.”",CO107CL12
10929,32,“But she didn’t go?”,CO107CL12
10930,33,“No. She canceled three days later.”,CO107CL12
10931,34,"At that moment, Dona Benedita returned, on the arm of Dona Maria dos Anjos. She smiled in embarrassment, apologized for the interruption, and sat down once again with her new friend by her side, thanking her profusely for looking after her and again clasping her hand.",CO107CL12
10932,35,"“I can see you only want what’s good for me,” she said.",CO107CL12
10933,36,"“It’s only what you deserve,” said Dona Maria dos Anjos.",CO107CL12
10934,37,"“Really?” Dona Benedita said, with a mix of vanity and modesty.",CO107CL12
10935,38,"And she declared that, no, it was the other lady who was truly good, just like her name. Dona Maria dos Anjos was an angel, a real angel! And Dona Benedita underlined the word with the same loving gaze, not persistent or prolonged, but restless and intermittent. For his part, the canon, seeking to expunge all memory of the unfortunate incident, changed the topic of conversation to the weighty matter of which was the best dessert. Opinions diverged widely. Some thought the coconut dessert was best, some the one with cashew nuts, and others the orange one, etc.",CO107CL12
10936,39,"The author of the toast, Leandrinho, said—although not with his lips but slyly with his eyes—that the sweetest of desserts were Eulália’s cheeks—a dusky, rosy-cheeked dessert. His own mother inwardly approved of those unspoken words, while the young woman’s mother did not even see them, so caught up was she in her adoration of her new friend. An angel, a real angel!",CO107CL12
10937,40,Chapter II,CO107CL12
10938,41,"The next day, Dona Benedita got up from her bed with the idea of writing a letter to her husband, a long letter in which she would tell him about the party, name all the guests and the different dishes, describe the reception afterward, and, more importantly, tell him about her new friendship with Dona Maria dos Anjos. The mail pouch closed at two in the afternoon, Dona Benedita had woken at nine, and, since she didn’t live far away (her house was on the Campo da Aclamação), a slave would be able to deliver the letter to the post office in plenty of time. What’s more, it was raining; Dona Benedita pulled back the net curtain and saw the drenched windowpanes; a persistent drizzle was falling, the sky was dark and overcast and dotted with thick black clouds. In the distance, she could see a cloth fluttering and flapping over a basket carried on the head of a black woman, from which she concluded that it was windy. A splendid day for staying at home, and, therefore, for writing a letter, two letters, or indeed all the letters a wife could possibly write to her absent husband. No one would come to tempt her away.",CO107CL12
10939,42,"While she arranges the lace fringes and frills on her white linen dressing gown, which the eminent judge had given her in 1862, also on her birthday, September 19, I invite the reader to take a closer look at her. You will notice that I refrain from calling her a Venus, but nor do I call her a Medusa. Unlike Medusa, she wears her hair brushed smoothly back and fastened just above the nape of her neck. Her eyes are ordinary enough, but have a kindly expression.",CO107CL12
10940,43,"Her mouth is the sort that appears cheerful even when not smiling, and enjoys that other remarkable gift of showing neither remorse nor regret: one could even say it is devoid of desires, but I will say only what I want to say, and I wish to speak only of remorse and regret. This head, which neither excites nor repels, sits on a body that is tall rather than short, and neither thin nor fat, but in proportion with her build. But I won’t describe her hands just yet. Why should I? You will admire them soon enough, holding pen to paper with slender, idle fingers, two of them adorned with five or six rings.",CO107CL12
10941,44,"One need only see the way in which she arranges the lacy frills of her gown in order to understand that she is a persnickety woman, fond of keeping everything around her and herself tidy. I note that she has just torn the lace trimming on her left cuff, but that is because she, being impatient by nature, blurted out, “Damn and blast the thing.” Those were her exact words, immediately followed by a “May God forgive me!” which took all the venom out of her.",CO107CL12
10942,45,"I don’t say that she stamped her foot, but she might have, since that is a gesture natural to certain ladies when annoyed. In any event, her anger lasted barely a minute. She then went to her sewing box to stitch up the torn lace, but decided to make do with a pin. The pin fell to the floor; she knelt down and picked it up. There were of course others in the box, many others, but she didn’t think it wise to leave pins lying on the floor.",CO107CL12
10943,46,"As she knelt, she caught sight of the tip of her slipper, on which there was a white mark; she sat down on the nearby chair, removed her slipper, and saw what it was: it had been chewed by a cockroach. Dona Benedita again fell into a rage, because the slipper was a very smart one, and had been given to her the year before by a dear friend.",CO107CL12
10944,47,"An angel, a real angel! Dona Benedita fixed her eyes on the white mark; happily their usual expression of simple charity was not so charitable as to allow itself to be entirely replaced by other, less passive expressions, and so it resumed its rightful place. Dona Benedita turned the slipper over and over, passing it from one hand to the other, lovingly at first, then mechanically, until her hands stopped moving completely, and the slipper fell into her lap, and Dona Benedita sat staring into space. At this point, the clock in the drawing room began to strike. After the first two chimes, Dona Benedita shuddered:",CO107CL12
10945,48,“Good Lord! It’s ten o’clock!”,CO107CL12
10946,49,"And she quickly put her slipper back on, hurriedly pinned the cuff of her gown, and went to her writing desk to begin the letter. She had put the date and “My ungrateful husband,” and had barely written: “Did you think of me yesterday? I . . .” when Eulália knocked on her door, calling out:",CO107CL12
10947,50,“Mama! Mama! It’s time for breakfast.”,CO107CL12
10948,51,"Dona Benedita opened the door, Eulália kissed her hand, then raised her own hands heavenward:",CO107CL12
10949,52,“Goodness gracious! What a sleepyhead!”,CO107CL12
10950,53,“Is breakfast ready?”,CO107CL12
10951,54,"“Yes, it’s been ready for ages!”",CO107CL12
10952,55,“But I gave orders that breakfast today should be later than usual . . . I’ve been writing to your father.”,CO107CL12
10953,56,"She looked at her daughter for a few moments, as if about to say something serious, or at least difficult, such was the grave, indecisive look in her eyes. But, in the end, she said nothing, and her daughter, announcing again that breakfast was served, took her by the arm and led her away.",CO107CL12
10954,57,"Let us leave them to eat breakfast at leisure, and take the weight off our feet here in the drawing room, without, however, feeling the need to catalogue every item of its furniture, just as we have failed to do in any other room of the house. Not that the furniture is ugly or in bad taste; on the contrary, it is all rather good. But the overall impression is rather strange, as if the choice of furnishings were the result of some subsequently abandoned plan, or a succession of abandoned plans.",CO107CL12
10955,58,"Mother, daughter, and son breakfasted together. Let us leave aside the son, who is of no interest to us; a young whippersnapper of twelve years old, but so sickly that he looks more like eight. Eulália is the one who interests us, not only because of what we glimpsed in the preceding chapter, but also because, when her mother began to talk about Dona Maria dos Anjos and Leandrinho, she became very serious and, perhaps, a little sullen. Dona Benedita realized that her daughter did not like this topic of conversation and so she retreated, like someone turning a corner to avoid an undesirable encounter. She rose from the table, and her daughter followed her into the drawing room.",CO107CL12
10956,59,"It was a quarter past eleven. Dona Benedita spoke with her daughter until shortly after midday, so as to have time to digest her breakfast and write the letter. As you are aware, the mail pouch closes at two o’clock. And so, a few minutes after midday, Dona Benedita told her daughter to go and practice the piano, so that she could finish the letter. Dona Benedita left the drawing room; Eulália went over to the window, glanced out at the square outside, and I can vouch for the fact that she did so with a glimmer of sadness in her eyes.",CO107CL12
10957,60,"It was not, however, a weak and indecisive sadness; it was the sadness of a resolute young woman who anticipates the pain her actions will cause to others, but, nevertheless, swears to go through with them, and does go through with them. I accept that not all these details could be surmised merely from Eulália’s eyes, but it is for this very reason that stories are told by someone who takes it upon themselves to fill in the gaps and reveal what is hidden. True, it was certainly a vigorous sadness and equally true that a glimmer of hope would soon appear in her eyes.",CO107CL12
10958,61,"“This can’t go on,” she murmured, coming back into the room.",CO107CL12
10959,62,"At that very moment, a carriage pulled up at the front door. A lady stepped out, the doorbell sounded, a houseboy went down to open the gate, and Dona Maria dos Anjos came up the steps. When the visitor was announced, Dona Benedita dropped her pen in agitation; she hurriedly got dressed, put on her shoes, and went into the drawing room.",CO107CL12
10960,63,“Fancy coming out in this weather!” she exclaimed. “That is true friendship!”,CO107CL12
10961,64,"“I didn’t want to wait for you to visit me, simply to show that I’m not one to stand on ceremony, and that between you and me there must be no constraints.”",CO107CL12
10962,65,"This was followed by the same compliments and sweet, caressing words as on the previous day. Dona Benedita kept insisting that coming to visit her that very day was the greatest of courtesies and a proof of genuine friendship, but, she added a moment later, she wished for further proof and asked Dona Maria dos Anjos to stay for dinner. Her friend excused herself, pleading that she had to be elsewhere; furthermore, this was the very proof of friendship that she herself desired, namely, that Dona Benedita should come and dine at her house first. Dona Benedita did not hesitate and promised that she would dine with her that very week.",CO107CL12
10963,66,"“I was just this minute writing your name,” she continued.",CO107CL12
10964,67,“Were you?”,CO107CL12
10965,68,"“Yes, I’m writing to my husband and telling him all about you. I won’t repeat to you what I’ve written, but you can imagine that I spoke very ill of you, telling him what an unkind, insufferable, tedious woman you are, a terrible bore . . . You can just imagine!”",CO107CL12
10966,69,"“I can indeed. And you can add that, despite all that and more, I send him my deepest respects.”",CO107CL12
10967,70,"“See how witty she is!” remarked Dona Benedita, looking at her daughter.",CO107CL12
10968,71,"Eulália smiled unconvincingly. Perched on a chair facing her mother, beside the sofa on which Dona Maria dos Anjos was sitting, Eulália gave the two ladies’ conversation only the degree of attention that good manners required, and not a jot more. She came close to looking bored; every smile that appeared on her lips was wan and languid, pure duty.",CO107CL12
10969,72,"One of her braids—it was still morning and she was wearing her hair in two long braids—served her as a pretext to look away from time to time, because she would occasionally tug at it to count the hairs, or so it seemed. At least that’s what Dona Maria dos Anjos thought, when she occasionally shot a glance in Eulália’s direction, curious and somewhat suspicious. For her part, Dona Benedita saw nothing; she had eyes only for her dear friend, her enchantress, as she called her two or three times: “my dear, dear enchantress.”",CO107CL12
10970,73,“Enough!”,CO107CL12
10971,74,"Dona Maria dos Anjos explained that she had a few other visits to make, but her friend prevailed upon her to stay for a little longer. She was wearing a very elegant cape of black lace, and Dona Benedita said that she had one just the same and sent one of the slaves to fetch it. Delays, delays. But Leandrinho’s mother was so pleased!",CO107CL12
10972,75,"Dona Benedita filled her heart with happiness; she found in her all the qualities best suited to her own personality and her manners: tenderness, trust, enthusiasm, simplicity, a warm and willing familiarity. The cape was brought, refreshments were offered; Dona Maria dos Anjos would accept nothing more than a kiss and the promise that they would dine with her that very week.",CO107CL12
10973,76,"“On Thursday,” said Dona Benedita.",CO107CL12
10974,77,“Promise?”,CO107CL12
10975,78,“I promise.”,CO107CL12
10976,79,“What would you have me do to you if you don’t come? It will need to be a very harsh punishment.”,CO107CL12
10977,80,“The harshest possible punishment would be for you never to speak to me again!”,CO107CL12
10978,81,"Dona Maria dos Anjos kissed her friend tenderly; then she hugged and kissed Eulália, too, but with rather less enthusiasm on both sides. They were measuring each other up, studying each other, and beginning to understand each other. Dona Benedita accompanied her friend to the stairs, then went over to the window to watch her get into her carriage; after settling herself in, her friend put her head out of the window, looked up, and waved goodbye.",CO107CL12
10979,82,“Don’t forget!”,CO107CL12
10980,83,“Thursday.”,CO107CL12
10981,84,"Eulália had already left the drawing room, and Dona Benedita rushed to finish the letter. It was getting late; she had said nothing yet about yesterday’s dinner, and it was too late to do so now. She gave a brief summary, extolling the virtues of her new friend; then, finally, she wrote the following words:",CO107CL12
10982,85,"Canon Roxo spoke to me about marrying Eulália to Dona Maria dos Anjos’s son. He graduated in law this year; he’s a conservative and, if Itaboraí does not resign from the government, he expects to be appointed a public prosecutor. I think it is the best possible match. Leandrinho (for that is his name) is a very polite young man; he proposed a toast to you, full of such fine words that I cried.",CO107CL12
10983,86,"I don’t know if Eulália will want him or not; I have my suspicions about another young fellow who joined us the other day in Laranjeiras. But what do you think? Should I limit myself to advising her, or should I impose our wishes? I really think I ought to use my authority, but I don’t want to do anything without your say-so. The best thing would be if you came here yourself.",CO107CL12
10984,87,"She finished the letter and sealed it. At that moment, Eulália came in, and Dona Benedita gave her the letter to be sent off, without delay, to the post office. The daughter left the room with the letter, not knowing that it concerned her and her future. Dona Benedita slumped down on the sofa, exhausted. Even though there was much she had not mentioned, the letter had still turned out to be a very long one and writing long letters was such a tiresome business!",CO107CL12
10985,88,Chapter III,CO107CL12
10986,89,"Yes, writing long letters was such a tiresome business! The words with which we closed the previous chapter fully explain Dona Benedita’s exhaustion. Half an hour later, she sat up a little and glanced around the study, as if looking for something. That something was a book. She found the book, or, rather, books, since there were no fewer than three, two open, one marked at a certain page, all lying on different chairs.",CO107CL12
10987,90,"They were the three novels that Dona Benedita was reading at the same time. One of them, you will note, had required considerable effort on her part. She had heard it warmly spoken of it while she was out walking near the house; it had arrived from Europe only the day before. Dona Benedita was so excited that, despite the lateness of the hour and the distance, she turned back and went to buy the book herself, visiting no fewer than three bookshops.",CO107CL12
10988,91,"She returned home so eager to read it that she opened the book during dinner and read the first five chapters that same night. When sleep overcame her, she slept; the following day, she was unable to continue reading, and forgot all about the book. Now, however, a week later, and wanting to read something, there it was close to hand.",CO107CL12
10989,92,“Ah!”,CO107CL12
10990,93,"And so she returns to the sofa, lovingly opens the book, and plunges eyes, heart and soul into the reading that had been so abruptly interrupted. It’s only natural that Dona Benedita should love novels, and it is even more natural that she should love nice ones. Do not be surprised, therefore, when she forgets everything around her to read this one; everything, even her daughter’s piano lesson, for which the piano teacher arrived and left without Dona Benedita once visiting the drawing room. Eulália said goodbye to her teacher, then went to the study, opened the door, tiptoed over to the sofa, and woke her mother with a kiss.",CO107CL12
10991,94,"“Wake up, sleepyhead!”",CO107CL12
10992,95,“Is it still raining?”,CO107CL12
10993,96,"“No, Mama, it’s stopped now.”",CO107CL12
10994,97,“Has the letter gone?”,CO107CL12
10995,98,"“Yes, I told José to hurry. I bet you forgot to give my dearest love to Papa? I thought so. Well, I never forget.”",CO107CL12
10996,99,"Dona Benedita yawned. She was no longer thinking about the letter; she was thinking about the corset she had ordered from Charavel’s, one with softer stays than the last one. She didn’t like hard stays, for she had a very delicate body. Eulália talked a little more about her father, but soon stopped, and, seeing the famous novel lying open on the floor, she picked it up, closed it, and set it on the table. At that moment, a letter was brought in for Dona Benedita; it was from Canon Roxo, who wrote to ask whether they were at home that day, because he would be going to a funeral nearby.",CO107CL12
10997,100,“Of course we’ll be at home!” Dona Benedita cried. “Do tell him to come.”,CO107CL12
10998,101,"Eulália wrote a little note in reply. Three-quarters of an hour later the canon entered Dona Benedita’s drawing room. He was a good man, the canon, an old friend of the family, in which, besides carving the turkey on solemn occasions, as we have seen, he exercised the role of family advisor, and did so both loyally and lovingly. Eulália was particularly dear to him; he had known her since she was a little girl, his attentive and mischievous little friend, and he felt a paternal affection toward her, so paternal that he had taken it upon himself to see her properly married, and, thought the canon, there could be no better bridegroom than Leandrinho.",CO107CL12
10999,102,"That day, his idea of going to dine with them was little more than a pretext; the canon wished to raise the subject directly with the young lady herself. Eulália, either because she guessed his intentions or because the canon’s presence brought Leandrinho to mind, became worried and annoyed.",CO107CL12
11000,103,"But worried or annoyed does not mean sad or dispirited. She was resolute, she had a strong character, she could resist, and she did resist, declaring to the canon, when he spoke to her that night about Leandrinho, that she absolutely did not wish to marry.",CO107CL12
11001,104,“Cross your heart and hope to die?”,CO107CL12
11002,105,“Cross my heart and hope to live.”,CO107CL12
11003,106,“But why?”,CO107CL12
11004,107,“Because I don’t want to.”,CO107CL12
11005,108,“And if Mama wants you to?”,CO107CL12
11006,109,“But I don’t want to.”,CO107CL12
11007,110,"“Well, that’s not very nice of you, Eulália.”",CO107CL12
11008,111,"Eulália did not reply. The canon returned yet again to the subject, praising the candidate’s fine qualities, the hopes of his family, the many advantages of their marriage; she listened to all this, but said nothing. However, when the canon put the question to her directly, her response was invariably:",CO107CL12
11009,112,“I’ve already said all there is to say.”,CO107CL12
11010,113,“You really don’t want to marry?”,CO107CL12
11011,114,“No.”,CO107CL12
11012,115,"The canon’s disappointment was deep and sincere. He wanted to see her properly married, and he could think of no better husband. He went so far as to probe her, discreetly, about whether her interest lay elsewhere. But Eulália, no less discreetly, responded that no, she had no other “interest”; she simply did not wish to marry.",CO107CL12
11013,116,"He believed this to be true, but also feared that it was not; he lacked sufficient experience in the ways of women to read beyond that negative. When he relayed all this to Dona Benedita, she was shocked by the abruptness of her daughter’s refusal; but she quickly recovered her composure and told the priest in no uncertain terms that her daughter had no say in the matter, and that she, Dona Benedita, would do as she wished, and she wanted the marriage.",CO107CL12
11014,117,"“There’s no point even waiting for her father’s reply,” she concluded. “I’ll just tell him that she’s getting married. It’s as simple as that. On Thursday I will dine with Dona Maria dos Anjos, and we will arrange everything.”",CO107CL12
11015,118,"“I must tell you,” ventured the canon, “that Dona Maria dos Anjos does not wish anything to be done by force.”",CO107CL12
11016,119,“What force? No force is required.”,CO107CL12
11017,120,The canon reflected for a moment.,CO107CL12
11018,121,"“In any event, we must not overrule any other attachment she may have formed,” he said.",CO107CL12
11019,122,"Dona Benedita made no reply, but inwardly swore that, come what may, her daughter would become the daughter-in-law of Dona Maria dos Anjos. And after the canon had left, she said to herself: “Well, I never! A mere slip of a girl thinking she can rule the roost!”",CO107CL12
11020,123,"Thursday dawned. Eulália, the mere slip of a girl, got out of bed feeling bright and cheerful and chatty, with all the windows of her spirit open to the blue morning air. Her mother awoke to hear a snippet from some glorious Italian melody; it was her daughter singing, happily and blithely, with all the indifference of birds who sing for themselves or for their own offspring, and not for the poet who listens and translates them into the immortal language of mankind.",CO107CL12
11021,124,"Dona Benedita had secretly cherished the idea of seeing her daughter downhearted and surly, and had expended a certain amount of imagination in deciding how she herself would act, pretending to be strong and forceful. Instead of a rebellious daughter, though, she found her to be talkative and amenable. It was a bad start to the day, like setting out prepared to destroy a fortress and finding instead a peaceful, welcoming city, its gates flung wide, politely inviting her to enter and break the bread of joy and harmony. It was a very bad start to the day.",CO107CL12
11022,125,"The second cause of Dona Benedita’s annoyance was a threatened migraine at three o’clock in the afternoon; a threat, or perhaps a suspicion of the possibility of a threat. She nearly canceled the visit, but her daughter thought it might do her good to go, and, in any event, it was too late to put it off. There was nothing else for it; Dona Benedita took her medicine, and, as she sat before the mirror brushing her hair, she was on the verge of saying that she would definitely stay at home, and she hinted as much to her daughter.",CO107CL12
11023,126,"“But Mama, Dona Maria dos Anjos is expecting you,” Eulália told her.",CO107CL12
11024,127,"“Indeed,” retorted her mother, “but I didn’t promise to go there if I was indisposed.”",CO107CL12
11025,128,"Finally, she got dressed, put on her gloves, and issued her instructions to the servants; her head must have been hurting a lot because she was rather curt with people, like someone being compelled to do something against their will. Her daughter did her best to raise her spirits, reminding her to take her little bottle of smelling salts, urging her to go, saying how eager Dona Maria dos Anjos was to see her, repeatedly checking the little watch pinned to her waist, and so on. She would be really put out.",CO107CL12
11026,129,"“Stop pestering me,” her mother said.",CO107CL12
11027,130,"And off she went, feeling exasperated, fervently wishing she could throttle her daughter, telling herself that daughters were the worst thing in the world. Sons were all right: they grew up and made a career for themselves; but daughters!",CO107CL12
11028,131,"Happily, the meal at Dona Maria dos Anjos’s calmed her down; not that it filled her with great satisfaction, because that wasn’t the case at all. Dona Benedita was not her usual self; she was cold and brusque, or almost brusque; she, however, explained the difference in her own terms, mentioning the threatened migraine, which was not exactly good news, but nevertheless cheered Dona Maria dos Anjos, for this refined and profound reason: it was better that her friend’s coolness was the result of an illness than a diminution in her affections.",CO107CL12
11029,132,"Moreover, it was nothing grave. And yet grave it was! There were no clasped hands, no loving gazes, no delicate titbits being consumed between fond caresses; in short, it was nothing like the dinner on Sunday. The meal was merely polite, not joyful; that was the most the canon could achieve. Oh, the kind, amiable canon!",CO107CL12
11030,133,"Eulália’s mood that day filled him with hope; her playful laughter, her easy conversation, her readiness to do as asked, to play and sing, and the tender, agreeable look on her face when she listened and spoke to Leandrinho; all this greatly restored the canon’s hopes. And for Dona Benedita to be indisposed today of all days! It really was bad luck.",CO107CL12
11031,134,"Dona Benedita’s spirits rose somewhat that evening after dinner. She talked a little more, discussed a plan to go for a stroll in the Jardim Botânico, even proposing that they go the very next day. However, Eulália warned her that it would be wise to wait a day or two for the effects of the migraine to wear off completely; and the look she got from her mother in return for her advice was as sharp as a dagger. The daughter had no fear of her mother’s eyes, though. As she brushed her hair that night, thinking over the day’s events, Eulália repeated to herself the words we heard her say, some days before, at the window.",CO107CL12
11032,135,“This can’t go on.”,CO107CL12
11033,136,"And before sleeping, she smugly pulled open a certain drawer, took out a little box, opened it, and removed a card measuring only about two inches by two—a portrait. It was clearly not the portrait of a woman, not only on account of the mustache, but also the uniform; he was, at the very least, a naval officer. Whether handsome or ugly is a matter of opinion. Eulália thought him handsome, the proof being that she kissed the portrait, not once but three times. Then she gazed at it longingly, and put it back in its box.",CO107CL12
11034,137,"What were you thinking, O strict and cautious mother, that you did not come and tear from the hands and lips of your daughter so subtle and mortal a venom? Standing at her window, Dona Benedita was gazing up at the night sky, amid the stars and gas lamps, with a roving, restless imagination, and filled with gnawing regrets and desires. Nothing had gone right for her since morning. Dona Benedita confessed, in the sweet intimacy of her own soul, that the dinner at Dona Maria dos Anjos’s had been dreadful, and that her friend probably wasn’t at her best, either.",CO107CL12
11035,138,"She felt certain regrets—although for what, she wasn’t entirely sure—and certain desires, but for quite what, she didn’t know. From time to time she gave a long, lazy yawn, like someone about to fall asleep; but if she felt anything at all it was boredom—boredom, impatience, and curiosity. Dona Benedita seriously wondered about going to join her husband; and no sooner had the thought of her husband entered her head than her heart was filled with longings and remorse, and her blood pulsed in her veins; so great was her desire to go and see the eminent judge that if her luggage had been packed and the northbound steamer had been waiting at the corner of the street, she would have embarked that very minute.",CO107CL12
11036,139,"No matter; there was sure to be another steamer in a week or ten days, and there was plenty of time to arrange her luggage. Since she would only be going for three months, she would not need to take very much. It would be a relief to get away from Rio, from the sameness of the days, the lack of novelties, the same faces, even the unchanging fashions—something that always troubled her: “Why should any fashion last for more than two weeks?”",CO107CL12
11037,140,"“I’ll go; there’s nothing more to be said. I’ll go to Pará,” she said softly.",CO107CL12
11038,141,"Indeed, the following morning, the first thing she did was to communicate this decision to her daughter, who took the news calmly. Dona Benedita checked how many trunks she already had, wondered if she needed one more, calculated the size, and decided to buy another. In a sudden moment of inspiration, Eulália said:",CO107CL12
11039,142,"“But Mama, we’re only going for three months, aren’t we?”",CO107CL12
11040,143,"“Yes, three . . . or possibly two.”",CO107CL12
11041,144,"“Well, then, it isn’t worth it. Two trunks will suffice.”",CO107CL12
11042,145,"“No, they won’t.”",CO107CL12
11043,146,"“Well, if they aren’t enough, we can always buy another one just before we leave. And you should go and choose it yourself—that would be much better than sending someone who knows nothing about trunks.”",CO107CL12
11044,147,"Dona Benedita thought this wise advice, and held on to her money. Her daughter smiled secretly. Perhaps she was repeating to herself the same words she had spoken at the window: “This can’t go on.” Her mother went to make arrangements, choosing clothes, making lists of things she needed to buy, a present for her husband, and so on. Oh, he would be so happy! In the afternoon, they went out to place orders, pay visits, buy tickets—four tickets, since they would each take a slave-woman with them.",CO107CL12
11045,148,"Eulália tried again to dissuade her, proposing that they delay the journey, but Dona Benedita declared that this was out of the question. At the offices of the steamship company, she was informed that the northbound steamer would leave on Friday of the following week. She asked for four tickets, opened her purse, pulled out a banknote, then two, then thought for a moment.",CO107CL12
11046,149,"“We could just buy our tickets the day before, couldn’t we?”",CO107CL12
11047,150,"“You could, but there might not be any tickets left.”",CO107CL12
11048,151,"“All right, what if you set aside four tickets for us, and I’ll send for them.”",CO107CL12
11049,152,“Your name?”,CO107CL12
11050,153,"“My name? No, better not take my name. We’ll come back three days before the steamer leaves. There are sure to be tickets then.”",CO107CL12
11051,154,“Possibly.”,CO107CL12
11052,155,"“No, there will be.”",CO107CL12
11053,156,"Once out in the street, Eulália remarked that it would be better to buy the tickets straightaway; and, since we know that she did not wish to travel either North or South, save on the frigate carrying the man we saw in that portrait the previous evening, one must assume that the young lady’s comment was profoundly Machiavellian. It wouldn’t surprise me. Dona Benedita, meanwhile, informed her friends and acquaintances of their forthcoming journey and none of them was surprised.",CO107CL12
11054,157,"One did ask if, this time, she really was going. Dona Maria dos Anjos had heard about the proposed trip from the canon, but the only thing that alarmed her when her friend came to say goodbye was Dona Benedita’s icy demeanor, her silence and indifference, and the way she kept her gaze fixed on the floor. A visit of barely ten minutes, during which Dona Benedita said only six words at the beginning:",CO107CL12
11055,158,“We are going to the North.”,CO107CL12
11056,159,And one at the end:,CO107CL12
11057,160,“Farewell.”,CO107CL12
11058,161,"Followed by three sad, corpse-like kisses.",CO107CL12
11059,162,Chapter IV,CO107CL12
11060,163,"The journey did not take place, for superstitious reasons. On the Sunday night, Dona Benedita realized that the steamer would be leaving on a Friday, which seemed to her a bad day to travel. They would go instead on the next steamer. However, they did not go on the next one, but this time her reasons lay entirely beyond the reach of human understanding; in such cases, the best advice is not to attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible. The fact of the matter is that Dona Benedita did not go, saying that she would go on the third steamer, unless, of course, something happened to change her plans.",CO107CL12
11061,164,"Her daughter had come up with a party and a new friendship. The new friendship was with a family in Andaraí; no one knows what the party was for, but it must have been a splendid affair, because Dona Benedita was still talking about it three days later. Three days! It really was too much. As for the family, they could not have been kinder; the whole thing had made the most tremendous impression on Dona Benedita. I use this superlative because she herself used it: a document made by human hands.",CO107CL12
11062,165,“Those people made the most tremendous impression on me.”,CO107CL12
11063,166,"And she began going for strolls in Andaraí, enchanted by the company of Dona Petronilha, Counselor Beltrão’s wife, and her sister Dona Maricota, who was going to marry a naval officer, the brother of that other naval officer whose mustache, eyes, hair, and bearing match those of the portrait the reader glimpsed earlier in that drawer. The married sister was thirty-two, and her earnestness and charming manners entirely bewitched Dona Benedita. The unmarried sister was a flower, a wax flower, another expression of Dona Benedita’s, which I have left unaltered for fear of watering down the truth.",CO107CL12
11064,167,"One of the most obscure aspects of this whole curious story is the speed with which friendships blossomed and events unfurled. For example, another regular visitor to Andaraí, along with Dona Benedita, was the very naval officer pictured on that little card. He was First Lieutenant Mascarenhas, whom Counselor Beltrão predicted would become an admiral.",CO107CL12
11065,168,"Note, however, the officer’s perfidy: he came in uniform; and Dona Benedita, who adored any new spectacle, found him so distinguished, so handsome compared with the other men in civilian clothes, that she preferred him to all of them, and told him so. The officer thanked her earnestly. She told him he must come and see them; he begged permission to pay a visit.",CO107CL12
11066,169,"“A visit? Why, you must come and dine with us.”",CO107CL12
11067,170,Mascarenhas assented with a bow.,CO107CL12
11068,171,"“Look here,” said Dona Benedita, “why don’t you come tomorrow?”",CO107CL12
11069,172,"Mascarenhas came, and came early. Dona Benedita talked to him about life at sea; he asked for her daughter’s hand in marriage. Dona Benedita was speechless, indeed shocked. She remembered, it is true, that, one day in Laranjeiras some time ago, she’d had her suspicions about him, but now her suspicions were long gone. Since then, she hadn’t seen the couple speak or look at one another even once. But marriage! Was that possible? It could not be anything else; the young man’s serious, respectful, and imploring behavior said clearly that he had indeed meant marriage. A dream come true!",CO107CL12
11070,173,"To invite to one’s home a friend, and open the door to a son-in-law: it was the very height of the unexpected. And the dream was a handsome one; the naval officer was a courteous young man; strong, elegant, friendly, openhearted, and, more importantly, he seemed to adore her, Dona Benedita. What a magnificent dream! Once she had recovered from her astonishment, Dona Benedita said, yes, Eulália was his. Mascarenhas took her hand and kissed it with filial devotion.",CO107CL12
11071,174,“But what of your husband?” he asked.,CO107CL12
11072,175,“My husband will agree with me.”,CO107CL12
11073,176,"Everything proceeded at great speed. Certificates were obtained, banns were read, and a date for the wedding set; it would take place twenty-four hours after the judge’s response was received. Dona Benedita, the good, kind mother, was beside herself with joy, busily caught up in preparing the trousseau, in planning and ordering the festivities, in choosing the guests! She rushed hither and thither, sometimes on foot, sometimes by carriage, come rain or shine.",CO107CL12
11074,177,"She did not linger over any one thing for very long; one day it was the trousseau, the next it was preparations for the wedding reception, the next there were visits to be made; she switched from one thing to another, then back again, and it was all somewhat frenetic. But the daughter was always there to make up for any shortcomings, to correct any mistakes, and trim back any excesses, with her own natural talent for such things. Unlike other bridegrooms, the naval officer did not get in their way; he did not take up Dona Benedita’s invitation to dine with them every evening; he dined with them only on Sundays, and paid them a visit once a week.",CO107CL12
11075,178,"He kept in touch through long, secret letters, as he had during their courtship. Dona Benedita could not explain such diffidence when she herself had fallen head over heels in love with him; and she would avenge his strange behavior by falling even deeper in love, and telling everyone the most wonderful things about him.",CO107CL12
11076,179,“A pearl! An absolute pearl!”,CO107CL12
11077,180,"“He’s certainly a fine young man,” they all agreed.",CO107CL12
11078,181,“Isn’t he just? First-rate!”,CO107CL12
11079,182,"She repeated the same thing in the letters she wrote her husband, both before and after receiving his reply to her first letter. In that reply the eminent judge gave his consent, adding that it pained him greatly that, due to a slight indisposition, he would be unable to attend the nuptials; however, he gave them his paternal blessing, and asked for a portrait of his new son-in-law.",CO107CL12
11080,183,"His wishes were followed to the letter. The wedding took place twenty-four hours after his letter arrived from Pará. It was, as Dona Benedita told certain friends later on, an admirable, splendid affair. Canon Roxo officiated, and it goes without saying that Dona Maria dos Anjos was not present, still less her son. Up until the very last minute, she had expected to receive a wedding announcement, an invitation, or perhaps a visit, even if she would, naturally enough, refrain from actually attending the ceremony; but nothing came.",CO107CL12
11081,184,"She was frankly astonished, and scoured her memory again and again for some inadvertent slight on her part that could explain this new coolness. Finding nothing, she imagined some intrigue. But she imagined wrongly, for it was a simple oversight. On the day of the wedding, it suddenly occurred to Dona Benedita that she had forgotten to send Dona Maria dos Anjos a wedding announcement.",CO107CL12
11082,185,"“Eulália, it seems we didn’t send the announcement to Dona Maria dos Anjos,” she said to her daughter over breakfast.",CO107CL12
11083,186,"“I don’t know, Mama. It was you who organized the invitations.”",CO107CL12
11084,187,"“Well, it seems that I didn’t,” said Dona Benedita. “More sugar, João.”",CO107CL12
11085,188,"The footman handed her the sugar, and, stirring her tea, she remembered the carriage that would be going to fetch the canon, and repeated one of the orders she had given the day before.",CO107CL12
11086,189,"But fortune is a capricious thing. Two weeks after the wedding, they received news of the judge’s death. I will not describe Dona Benedita’s grief; it was deep and sincere. The young newlyweds, lost in their own world up in Tijuca, came down to see her; Dona Benedita wept the tears of a heartbroken and devotedly faithful wife. After the seventh-day mass, she consulted her daughter and son-in-law on the idea of her going to Pará and having a tomb built for her husband, where she could kiss the earth in which he now lay.",CO107CL12
11087,190,"Mascarenhas exchanged a look with his wife, and then said to his mother-in-law that it would be better for them to go together, since he was due to go to the North in three months’ time on a government commission. Dona Benedita resisted somewhat, but accepted the three-month delay, meanwhile setting about giving all the necessary instructions for the building of the tomb. And so the tomb was built, but Mascarenhas’s commission did not materialize, and Dona Benedita was unable to go.",CO107CL12
11088,191,"Five months later, there occurred a small family incident. Dona Benedita had arranged to build a house on the road to Tijuca, and her son-in-law, using an interruption in the building work as a pretext, proposed that he should finish it. Dona Benedita agreed, and her agreement was all the more to her credit given that she was finding her son-in-law increasingly unbearable with his love of discipline, his obstinacy and impertinence. In fact, he didn’t need to be obstinate; rather, he had only to rely on his mother-in-law’s good nature and merely wait a few days for her to give in. But perhaps it was precisely this that vexed her. Happily, the government decided to dispatch him to the South, and the pregnant Eulália stayed with her mother.",CO107CL12
11089,192,"It was around this time that a widowed merchant took it upon himself to ask Dona Benedita for her hand in marriage. The first year of widowhood had passed. Dona Benedita received his proposal kindly, albeit with little enthusiasm. She looked to her own interests; her son’s age and studies would soon take him away to São Paulo, leaving her all alone in the world. The marriage would be a source of consolation and company. In her own mind, at home or out and about, she developed the idea, adorning it with her quick and lively imagination; it would be a new life for her, for it could be said that she had been a widow for a long time, even before her husband’s death. The merchant had a sound reputation: it would be an excellent choice.",CO107CL12
11090,193,"She did not marry. Her son-in-law returned from the South, her daughter gave birth to a strong, beautiful baby boy, who became his grandmother’s passion for the next few months. Then her son-in-law, daughter, and grandson all left for the North. Dona Benedita found herself alone and sad; her son was not enough to fill her affections. Once again the idea of traveling glimmered briefly in her mind, but only like a match that quickly burned out. Traveling alone would be tiring and dull; she decided it was better to stay.",CO107CL12
11091,194,"A poetry recital she happened to attend helped her shake off her torpor, and restored her to society. Society once again suggested the idea of marriage, and quickly put forward a candidate, this time a lawyer, also a widower.",CO107CL12
11092,195,“Shall I marry or shall I not?”,CO107CL12
11093,196,"One night, as Dona Benedita was turning this problem over in her mind while standing at the window of the house on the shore at Botafogo, where she had moved to some months earlier, she saw a most unusual spectacle. It began as an opaque glow, like a light filtered through frosted glass, filling the inlet of the bay beyond. Against this backdrop appeared a floating, transparent figure, wreathed in mist and veiled in shimmering reflections, its shape disappearing into thin air. The figure came right up to Dona Benedita’s windowsill, and, drowsily, in a childish voice, spoke these meaningless words:",CO107CL12
11094,197,“Marry . . . don’t marry . . . if you do marry . . . you will marry . . . you won’t marry . . . you will marry . . . get married . . .”,CO107CL12
11095,198,"Dona Benedita froze in terror, but still had strength enough to ask the figure who she was. The ghostly figure began to laugh, but that laughter quickly faded, and she replied that she was the fairy who had presided over Dona Benedita’s birth.",CO107CL12
11096,199,"“My name is Indecision,” said the fairy, and, like a sigh, dissolved into the night and the silence.",CO107CL12

11100,4,"THE MOST DIFFICULT THING in the world, apart from governing a country, must surely be that of guessing Dona Benedita’s exact age. Some said forty, some forty-five, others thirty-six. One stockbroker went as low as twenty-nine, but his judgment, clouded by hidden intentions, lacked the necessary stamp of sincerity that we all like to see in human opinions. Indeed, I only mention it to illustrate, from the very outset, that Dona Bene­dita was always the very model of good manners.",CO107CL10
11101,5,"The stockbroker’s flattery served only to arouse her indignation, albeit momentarily, yes, momentarily. As for those other estimates, oscillating between thirty-six and forty-five, none of them could be contradicted by Dona Benedita’s appearance, which was both maturely serious and youthfully graceful. The only surprising thing is that such speculation continued, when in order to know the truth one needed only to ask her.",CO107CL10
11102,6,"Dona Benedita reached her forty-second birthday on Sunday the nineteenth of September, 1869. At six o’clock in the evening, friends and relations, some twenty or twenty-five in number, are gathered around the family table. Many of them were also present at her birthday dinners of 1868, 1867, and 1866, and they have always heard their hostess’s age frankly alluded to. Moreover, there at the table, for all to see, are a young lady and a young master, her children; it is true that he, both in size and manners, is still somewhat boyish; on the other hand, the young lady, Eulália, is eighteen, although such is the severity of her manners and features that she looks twenty-one.",CO107CL10
11103,7,"The joviality of the guests, the excellence of the dinner, certain matrimonial negotiations entrusted to Canon Roxo (of which more shall be said anon), and the hostess’s generous nature, all these make for an intimate and happy affair. The canon stands up to carve the turkey. Dona Benedita has always abided by the custom in modest households of entrusting the turkey to one of the guests, instead of having it carved away from the table by servants, and the canon was the maestro of such solemn occasions.",CO107CL10
11104,8,"Nobody knew the bird’s anatomy better than he, nor how to wield the knife so nimbly. Perhaps—and this is a matter for the experts—perhaps his status as a canon gave to the carving knife, in the minds of the guests, a certain prestige, which would be lacking if, for example, he were a mere student of mathematics or an office clerk. On the other hand, would a student or scribe, without the lessons of long practice, have at their disposal the canon’s consummate art? That is another important question.",CO107CL10
11105,9,"As for the other guests, they are sitting and chatting; the gurgle of half-sated stomachs reigns, the laughter of nature on its way to repleteness; it is a moment of relaxation.",CO107CL10
11106,10,"Dona Benedita is talking, as are her visitors; however, she does not speak to all of them, but only to the one seated next to her. Her neighbor is a plump, kindly, cheerful lady, the mother of a twenty-one-year-old graduate, Leandrinho, who is sitting opposite them. Dona Benedita is not merely talking to the plump lady, she is clasping one of her hands, and not only is she clasping the plump lady’s hand, she is also looking at her with vivacious, lovestruck eyes.",CO107CL10
11107,11,"Note that hers is not a persistent or prolonged gaze, but rather a series of small, restless, momentary glances. In any event, there is much tenderness in that gesture, and even if there weren’t, nothing would be lost, because Dona Benedita repeats with her lips everything that her eyes have already said to Dona Maria dos Anjos: that she is absolutely delighted, that it is wonderful to meet her, that Dona Maria is so very kind, so very dignified, that her eyes are the very windows of her soul, and so on. One of her friends says jokingly to Dona Benedita that she is making her jealous.",CO107CL10
11108,12,"“Oh, stuff and nonsense!” she replies, laughing.",CO107CL10
11109,13,"And, turning back to the other woman:",CO107CL10
11110,14,“Don’t you agree? No one should come between us.”,CO107CL10
11111,15,"And she carried on showering her with compliments, courtesies, and smiles, the offers of more of this, more of that, plans to go on a trip together or perhaps to the theater, and promises of many visits, all spoken in such warm, effusive tones that her new companion was visibly throbbing with pleasure and gratitude.",CO107CL10
11112,16,"The turkey has been eaten. Dona Maria dos Anjos signals to her son, who stands up and asks them to accompany him in a toast:",CO107CL10
11113,17,"“Ladies and gentlemen, there is a saying in French: les absents ont tort. Let us resolutely reject this, and drink to someone who is far, far away in terms of space, but close, very close indeed, to the heart of his dear wife. Let us drink to that most illustrious judge, Justice Proença.”",CO107CL10
11114,18,"The toast did not receive an enthusiastic response from the assembled guests, and to understand why one need only look at the sad face of their hostess. Her closest friends and relatives whispered to one another that young Leandrinho had been very thoughtless indeed; they drank the toast, but refrained from cheering, so as not, it would seem, to exacerbate Dona Benedita’s suffering. In vain: Dona Benedita, unable to contain herself, burst into tears, got up from the table, and left the room. Dona Maria dos Anjos went with her. There then followed a deathly silence. Eulália begged them all to carry on as normal, saying that her mother would be back shortly.",CO107CL10
11115,19,"“Mama is very sensitive,” she said, “and the idea of Papa being so far away . . .”",CO107CL10
11116,20,"Dismayed, Leandrinho apologized to Eulália. The fellow sitting next to him explained that Dona Benedita could not hear her husband’s name mentioned without feeling a crushing blow to her heart, promptly followed by tears; Leandrinho replied that he was aware of her misfortune, but had never imagined his toast would have such a harmful effect.",CO107CL10
11117,21,"“And yet it’s the most natural thing in the world,” explained the fellow, “for she misses her husband terribly.”",CO107CL10
11118,22,"“The canon,” replied Leandrinho, “told me her husband went to Pará about two years ago.”",CO107CL10
11119,23,"“Two and a half years. He was appointed district judge by the Zacarias government. He would have preferred the appeal court in São Paulo, or perhaps Bahia, but it was not to be, and so he accepted Pará instead.”",CO107CL10
11120,24,“And he hasn’t been back since?”,CO107CL10
11121,25,“No.”,CO107CL10
11122,26,“I presume Dona Benedita is afraid of such a long sea voyage . . .”,CO107CL10
11123,27,"“I don’t believe so. She’s already been to Europe. No, if I recall correctly, she stayed behind in Rio to sort out some family affairs, and then stayed on, and on, and now . . .”",CO107CL10
11124,28,“But would it not have been far better to go to Pará than to suffer like this? Do you know her husband?”,CO107CL10
11125,29,"“I do; a very distinguished gentleman, and still hale and hearty; he couldn’t be more than forty-five. Tall, bearded, handsome. People used to say that he didn’t insist on his wife joining him because he had fallen for some widow up there.”",CO107CL10
11126,30,“Ah!”,CO107CL10
11127,31,"“And someone even came and told Dona Benedita. Imagine how the poor lady must have felt! She cried all night, and the next day she wouldn’t eat any breakfast, and made arrangements to take the very next steamship to Pará.”",CO107CL10
11128,32,“But she didn’t go?”,CO107CL10
11129,33,“No. She canceled three days later.”,CO107CL10
11130,34,"At that moment, Dona Benedita returned, on the arm of Dona Maria dos Anjos. She smiled in embarrassment, apologized for the interruption, and sat down once again with her new friend by her side, thanking her profusely for looking after her and again clasping her hand.",CO107CL10
11131,35,"“I can see you only want what’s good for me,” she said.",CO107CL10
11132,36,"“It’s only what you deserve,” said Dona Maria dos Anjos.",CO107CL10
11133,37,"“Really?” Dona Benedita said, with a mix of vanity and modesty.",CO107CL10
11134,38,"And she declared that, no, it was the other lady who was truly good, just like her name. Dona Maria dos Anjos was an angel, a real angel! And Dona Benedita underlined the word with the same loving gaze, not persistent or prolonged, but restless and intermittent. For his part, the canon, seeking to expunge all memory of the unfortunate incident, changed the topic of conversation to the weighty matter of which was the best dessert. Opinions diverged widely. Some thought the coconut dessert was best, some the one with cashew nuts, and others the orange one, etc.",CO107CL10
11135,39,"The author of the toast, Leandrinho, said—although not with his lips but slyly with his eyes—that the sweetest of desserts were Eulália’s cheeks—a dusky, rosy-cheeked dessert. His own mother inwardly approved of those unspoken words, while the young woman’s mother did not even see them, so caught up was she in her adoration of her new friend. An angel, a real angel!",CO107CL10
11136,40,Chapter II,CO107CL10
11137,41,"The next day, Dona Benedita got up from her bed with the idea of writing a letter to her husband, a long letter in which she would tell him about the party, name all the guests and the different dishes, describe the reception afterward, and, more importantly, tell him about her new friendship with Dona Maria dos Anjos. The mail pouch closed at two in the afternoon, Dona Benedita had woken at nine, and, since she didn’t live far away (her house was on the Campo da Aclamação), a slave would be able to deliver the letter to the post office in plenty of time. What’s more, it was raining; Dona Benedita pulled back the net curtain and saw the drenched windowpanes; a persistent drizzle was falling, the sky was dark and overcast and dotted with thick black clouds. In the distance, she could see a cloth fluttering and flapping over a basket carried on the head of a black woman, from which she concluded that it was windy. A splendid day for staying at home, and, therefore, for writing a letter, two letters, or indeed all the letters a wife could possibly write to her absent husband. No one would come to tempt her away.",CO107CL10
11138,42,"While she arranges the lace fringes and frills on her white linen dressing gown, which the eminent judge had given her in 1862, also on her birthday, September 19, I invite the reader to take a closer look at her. You will notice that I refrain from calling her a Venus, but nor do I call her a Medusa. Unlike Medusa, she wears her hair brushed smoothly back and fastened just above the nape of her neck. Her eyes are ordinary enough, but have a kindly expression.",CO107CL10
11139,43,"Her mouth is the sort that appears cheerful even when not smiling, and enjoys that other remarkable gift of showing neither remorse nor regret: one could even say it is devoid of desires, but I will say only what I want to say, and I wish to speak only of remorse and regret. This head, which neither excites nor repels, sits on a body that is tall rather than short, and neither thin nor fat, but in proportion with her build. But I won’t describe her hands just yet. Why should I? You will admire them soon enough, holding pen to paper with slender, idle fingers, two of them adorned with five or six rings.",CO107CL10
11140,44,"One need only see the way in which she arranges the lacy frills of her gown in order to understand that she is a persnickety woman, fond of keeping everything around her and herself tidy. I note that she has just torn the lace trimming on her left cuff, but that is because she, being impatient by nature, blurted out, “Damn and blast the thing.” Those were her exact words, immediately followed by a “May God forgive me!” which took all the venom out of her.",CO107CL10
11141,45,"I don’t say that she stamped her foot, but she might have, since that is a gesture natural to certain ladies when annoyed. In any event, her anger lasted barely a minute. She then went to her sewing box to stitch up the torn lace, but decided to make do with a pin. The pin fell to the floor; she knelt down and picked it up. There were of course others in the box, many others, but she didn’t think it wise to leave pins lying on the floor.",CO107CL10
11142,46,"As she knelt, she caught sight of the tip of her slipper, on which there was a white mark; she sat down on the nearby chair, removed her slipper, and saw what it was: it had been chewed by a cockroach. Dona Benedita again fell into a rage, because the slipper was a very smart one, and had been given to her the year before by a dear friend.",CO107CL10
11143,47,"An angel, a real angel! Dona Benedita fixed her eyes on the white mark; happily their usual expression of simple charity was not so charitable as to allow itself to be entirely replaced by other, less passive expressions, and so it resumed its rightful place. Dona Benedita turned the slipper over and over, passing it from one hand to the other, lovingly at first, then mechanically, until her hands stopped moving completely, and the slipper fell into her lap, and Dona Benedita sat staring into space. At this point, the clock in the drawing room began to strike. After the first two chimes, Dona Benedita shuddered:",CO107CL10
11144,48,“Good Lord! It’s ten o’clock!”,CO107CL10
11145,49,"And she quickly put her slipper back on, hurriedly pinned the cuff of her gown, and went to her writing desk to begin the letter. She had put the date and “My ungrateful husband,” and had barely written: “Did you think of me yesterday? I . . .” when Eulália knocked on her door, calling out:",CO107CL10
11146,50,“Mama! Mama! It’s time for breakfast.”,CO107CL10

11151,55,“But I gave orders that breakfast today should be later than usual . . . I’ve been writing to your father.”,CO107CL10
11152,56,"She looked at her daughter for a few moments, as if about to say something serious, or at least difficult, such was the grave, indecisive look in her eyes. But, in the end, she said nothing, and her daughter, announcing again that breakfast was served, took her by the arm and led her away.",CO107CL10
11153,57,"Let us leave them to eat breakfast at leisure, and take the weight off our feet here in the drawing room, without, however, feeling the need to catalogue every item of its furniture, just as we have failed to do in any other room of the house. Not that the furniture is ugly or in bad taste; on the contrary, it is all rather good. But the overall impression is rather strange, as if the choice of furnishings were the result of some subsequently abandoned plan, or a succession of abandoned plans.",CO107CL10
11154,58,"Mother, daughter, and son breakfasted together. Let us leave aside the son, who is of no interest to us; a young whippersnapper of twelve years old, but so sickly that he looks more like eight. Eulália is the one who interests us, not only because of what we glimpsed in the preceding chapter, but also because, when her mother began to talk about Dona Maria dos Anjos and Leandrinho, she became very serious and, perhaps, a little sullen. Dona Benedita realized that her daughter did not like this topic of conversation and so she retreated, like someone turning a corner to avoid an undesirable encounter. She rose from the table, and her daughter followed her into the drawing room.",CO107CL10
11155,59,"It was a quarter past eleven. Dona Benedita spoke with her daughter until shortly after midday, so as to have time to digest her breakfast and write the letter. As you are aware, the mail pouch closes at two o’clock. And so, a few minutes after midday, Dona Benedita told her daughter to go and practice the piano, so that she could finish the letter. Dona Benedita left the drawing room; Eulália went over to the window, glanced out at the square outside, and I can vouch for the fact that she did so with a glimmer of sadness in her eyes.",CO107CL10
11156,60,"It was not, however, a weak and indecisive sadness; it was the sadness of a resolute young woman who anticipates the pain her actions will cause to others, but, nevertheless, swears to go through with them, and does go through with them. I accept that not all these details could be surmised merely from Eulália’s eyes, but it is for this very reason that stories are told by someone who takes it upon themselves to fill in the gaps and reveal what is hidden. True, it was certainly a vigorous sadness and equally true that a glimmer of hope would soon appear in her eyes.",CO107CL10
11157,61,"“This can’t go on,” she murmured, coming back into the room.",CO107CL10
11158,62,"At that very moment, a carriage pulled up at the front door. A lady stepped out, the doorbell sounded, a houseboy went down to open the gate, and Dona Maria dos Anjos came up the steps. When the visitor was announced, Dona Benedita dropped her pen in agitation; she hurriedly got dressed, put on her shoes, and went into the drawing room.",CO107CL10
11159,63,“Fancy coming out in this weather!” she exclaimed. “That is true friendship!”,CO107CL10
11160,64,"“I didn’t want to wait for you to visit me, simply to show that I’m not one to stand on ceremony, and that between you and me there must be no constraints.”",CO107CL10
11161,65,"This was followed by the same compliments and sweet, caressing words as on the previous day. Dona Benedita kept insisting that coming to visit her that very day was the greatest of courtesies and a proof of genuine friendship, but, she added a moment later, she wished for further proof and asked Dona Maria dos Anjos to stay for dinner. Her friend excused herself, pleading that she had to be elsewhere; furthermore, this was the very proof of friendship that she herself desired, namely, that Dona Benedita should come and dine at her house first. Dona Benedita did not hesitate and promised that she would dine with her that very week.",CO107CL10
11162,66,"“I was just this minute writing your name,” she continued.",CO107CL10
11163,67,“Were you?”,CO107CL10
11164,68,"“Yes, I’m writing to my husband and telling him all about you. I won’t repeat to you what I’ve written, but you can imagine that I spoke very ill of you, telling him what an unkind, insufferable, tedious woman you are, a terrible bore . . . You can just imagine!”",CO107CL10
11165,69,"“I can indeed. And you can add that, despite all that and more, I send him my deepest respects.”",CO107CL10
11166,70,"“See how witty she is!” remarked Dona Benedita, looking at her daughter.",CO107CL10
11167,71,"Eulália smiled unconvincingly. Perched on a chair facing her mother, beside the sofa on which Dona Maria dos Anjos was sitting, Eulália gave the two ladies’ conversation only the degree of attention that good manners required, and not a jot more. She came close to looking bored; every smile that appeared on her lips was wan and languid, pure duty.",CO107CL10
11168,72,"One of her braids—it was still morning and she was wearing her hair in two long braids—served her as a pretext to look away from time to time, because she would occasionally tug at it to count the hairs, or so it seemed. At least that’s what Dona Maria dos Anjos thought, when she occasionally shot a glance in Eulália’s direction, curious and somewhat suspicious. For her part, Dona Benedita saw nothing; she had eyes only for her dear friend, her enchantress, as she called her two or three times: “my dear, dear enchantress.”",CO107CL10
11169,73,“Enough!”,CO107CL10
11170,74,"Dona Maria dos Anjos explained that she had a few other visits to make, but her friend prevailed upon her to stay for a little longer. She was wearing a very elegant cape of black lace, and Dona Benedita said that she had one just the same and sent one of the slaves to fetch it. Delays, delays. But Leandrinho’s mother was so pleased!",CO107CL10
11171,75,"Dona Benedita filled her heart with happiness; she found in her all the qualities best suited to her own personality and her manners: tenderness, trust, enthusiasm, simplicity, a warm and willing familiarity. The cape was brought, refreshments were offered; Dona Maria dos Anjos would accept nothing more than a kiss and the promise that they would dine with her that very week.",CO107CL10

11177,81,"Dona Maria dos Anjos kissed her friend tenderly; then she hugged and kissed Eulália, too, but with rather less enthusiasm on both sides. They were measuring each other up, studying each other, and beginning to understand each other. Dona Benedita accompanied her friend to the stairs, then went over to the window to watch her get into her carriage; after settling herself in, her friend put her head out of the window, looked up, and waved goodbye.",CO107CL10
11178,82,“Don’t forget!”,CO107CL10
11179,83,“Thursday.”,CO107CL10
11180,84,"Eulália had already left the drawing room, and Dona Benedita rushed to finish the letter. It was getting late; she had said nothing yet about yesterday’s dinner, and it was too late to do so now. She gave a brief summary, extolling the virtues of her new friend; then, finally, she wrote the following words:",CO107CL10
11181,85,"Canon Roxo spoke to me about marrying Eulália to Dona Maria dos Anjos’s son. He graduated in law this year; he’s a conservative and, if Itaboraí does not resign from the government, he expects to be appointed a public prosecutor. I think it is the best possible match. Leandrinho (for that is his name) is a very polite young man; he proposed a toast to you, full of such fine words that I cried.",CO107CL10
11182,86,"I don’t know if Eulália will want him or not; I have my suspicions about another young fellow who joined us the other day in Laranjeiras. But what do you think? Should I limit myself to advising her, or should I impose our wishes? I really think I ought to use my authority, but I don’t want to do anything without your say-so. The best thing would be if you came here yourself.",CO107CL10
11183,87,"She finished the letter and sealed it. At that moment, Eulália came in, and Dona Benedita gave her the letter to be sent off, without delay, to the post office. The daughter left the room with the letter, not knowing that it concerned her and her future. Dona Benedita slumped down on the sofa, exhausted. Even though there was much she had not mentioned, the letter had still turned out to be a very long one and writing long letters was such a tiresome business!",CO107CL10
11184,88,Chapter III,CO107CL10
11185,89,"Yes, writing long letters was such a tiresome business! The words with which we closed the previous chapter fully explain Dona Benedita’s exhaustion. Half an hour later, she sat up a little and glanced around the study, as if looking for something. That something was a book. She found the book, or, rather, books, since there were no fewer than three, two open, one marked at a certain page, all lying on different chairs.",CO107CL10
11186,90,"They were the three novels that Dona Benedita was reading at the same time. One of them, you will note, had required considerable effort on her part. She had heard it warmly spoken of it while she was out walking near the house; it had arrived from Europe only the day before. Dona Benedita was so excited that, despite the lateness of the hour and the distance, she turned back and went to buy the book herself, visiting no fewer than three bookshops.",CO107CL10
11187,91,"She returned home so eager to read it that she opened the book during dinner and read the first five chapters that same night. When sleep overcame her, she slept; the following day, she was unable to continue reading, and forgot all about the book. Now, however, a week later, and wanting to read something, there it was close to hand.",CO107CL10
11188,92,“Ah!”,CO107CL10
11189,93,"And so she returns to the sofa, lovingly opens the book, and plunges eyes, heart and soul into the reading that had been so abruptly interrupted. It’s only natural that Dona Benedita should love novels, and it is even more natural that she should love nice ones. Do not be surprised, therefore, when she forgets everything around her to read this one; everything, even her daughter’s piano lesson, for which the piano teacher arrived and left without Dona Benedita once visiting the drawing room. Eulália said goodbye to her teacher, then went to the study, opened the door, tiptoed over to the sofa, and woke her mother with a kiss.",CO107CL10
11190,94,"“Wake up, sleepyhead!”",CO107CL10

11194,98,"“Yes, I told José to hurry. I bet you forgot to give my dearest love to Papa? I thought so. Well, I never forget.”",CO107CL10
11195,99,"Dona Benedita yawned. She was no longer thinking about the letter; she was thinking about the corset she had ordered from Charavel’s, one with softer stays than the last one. She didn’t like hard stays, for she had a very delicate body. Eulália talked a little more about her father, but soon stopped, and, seeing the famous novel lying open on the floor, she picked it up, closed it, and set it on the table. At that moment, a letter was brought in for Dona Benedita; it was from Canon Roxo, who wrote to ask whether they were at home that day, because he would be going to a funeral nearby.",CO107CL10
11196,100,“Of course we’ll be at home!” Dona Benedita cried. “Do tell him to come.”,CO107CL10
11197,101,"Eulália wrote a little note in reply. Three-quarters of an hour later the canon entered Dona Benedita’s drawing room. He was a good man, the canon, an old friend of the family, in which, besides carving the turkey on solemn occasions, as we have seen, he exercised the role of family advisor, and did so both loyally and lovingly. Eulália was particularly dear to him; he had known her since she was a little girl, his attentive and mischievous little friend, and he felt a paternal affection toward her, so paternal that he had taken it upon himself to see her properly married, and, thought the canon, there could be no better bridegroom than Leandrinho.",CO107CL10
11198,102,"That day, his idea of going to dine with them was little more than a pretext; the canon wished to raise the subject directly with the young lady herself. Eulália, either because she guessed his intentions or because the canon’s presence brought Leandrinho to mind, became worried and annoyed.",CO107CL10
11199,103,"But worried or annoyed does not mean sad or dispirited. She was resolute, she had a strong character, she could resist, and she did resist, declaring to the canon, when he spoke to her that night about Leandrinho, that she absolutely did not wish to marry.",CO107CL10

11206,110,"“Well, that’s not very nice of you, Eulália.”",CO107CL10
11207,111,"Eulália did not reply. The canon returned yet again to the subject, praising the candidate’s fine qualities, the hopes of his family, the many advantages of their marriage; she listened to all this, but said nothing. However, when the canon put the question to her directly, her response was invariably:",CO107CL10
11208,112,“I’ve already said all there is to say.”,CO107CL10
11209,113,“You really don’t want to marry?”,CO107CL10
11210,114,“No.”,CO107CL10
11211,115,"The canon’s disappointment was deep and sincere. He wanted to see her properly married, and he could think of no better husband. He went so far as to probe her, discreetly, about whether her interest lay elsewhere. But Eulália, no less discreetly, responded that no, she had no other “interest”; she simply did not wish to marry.",CO107CL10
11212,116,"He believed this to be true, but also feared that it was not; he lacked sufficient experience in the ways of women to read beyond that negative. When he relayed all this to Dona Benedita, she was shocked by the abruptness of her daughter’s refusal; but she quickly recovered her composure and told the priest in no uncertain terms that her daughter had no say in the matter, and that she, Dona Benedita, would do as she wished, and she wanted the marriage.",CO107CL10
11213,117,"“There’s no point even waiting for her father’s reply,” she concluded. “I’ll just tell him that she’s getting married. It’s as simple as that. On Thursday I will dine with Dona Maria dos Anjos, and we will arrange everything.”",CO107CL10
11214,118,"“I must tell you,” ventured the canon, “that Dona Maria dos Anjos does not wish anything to be done by force.”",CO107CL10
11215,119,“What force? No force is required.”,CO107CL10
11216,120,The canon reflected for a moment.,CO107CL10
11217,121,"“In any event, we must not overrule any other attachment she may have formed,” he said.",CO107CL10
11218,122,"Dona Benedita made no reply, but inwardly swore that, come what may, her daughter would become the daughter-in-law of Dona Maria dos Anjos. And after the canon had left, she said to herself: “Well, I never! A mere slip of a girl thinking she can rule the roost!”",CO107CL10
11219,123,"Thursday dawned. Eulália, the mere slip of a girl, got out of bed feeling bright and cheerful and chatty, with all the windows of her spirit open to the blue morning air. Her mother awoke to hear a snippet from some glorious Italian melody; it was her daughter singing, happily and blithely, with all the indifference of birds who sing for themselves or for their own offspring, and not for the poet who listens and translates them into the immortal language of mankind.",CO107CL10
11220,124,"Dona Benedita had secretly cherished the idea of seeing her daughter downhearted and surly, and had expended a certain amount of imagination in deciding how she herself would act, pretending to be strong and forceful. Instead of a rebellious daughter, though, she found her to be talkative and amenable. It was a bad start to the day, like setting out prepared to destroy a fortress and finding instead a peaceful, welcoming city, its gates flung wide, politely inviting her to enter and break the bread of joy and harmony. It was a very bad start to the day.",CO107CL10
11221,125,"The second cause of Dona Benedita’s annoyance was a threatened migraine at three o’clock in the afternoon; a threat, or perhaps a suspicion of the possibility of a threat. She nearly canceled the visit, but her daughter thought it might do her good to go, and, in any event, it was too late to put it off. There was nothing else for it; Dona Benedita took her medicine, and, as she sat before the mirror brushing her hair, she was on the verge of saying that she would definitely stay at home, and she hinted as much to her daughter.",CO107CL10
11222,126,"“But Mama, Dona Maria dos Anjos is expecting you,” Eulália told her.",CO107CL10
11223,127,"“Indeed,” retorted her mother, “but I didn’t promise to go there if I was indisposed.”",CO107CL10
11224,128,"Finally, she got dressed, put on her gloves, and issued her instructions to the servants; her head must have been hurting a lot because she was rather curt with people, like someone being compelled to do something against their will. Her daughter did her best to raise her spirits, reminding her to take her little bottle of smelling salts, urging her to go, saying how eager Dona Maria dos Anjos was to see her, repeatedly checking the little watch pinned to her waist, and so on. She would be really put out.",CO107CL10
11225,129,"“Stop pestering me,” her mother said.",CO107CL10
11226,130,"And off she went, feeling exasperated, fervently wishing she could throttle her daughter, telling herself that daughters were the worst thing in the world. Sons were all right: they grew up and made a career for themselves; but daughters!",CO107CL10
11227,131,"Happily, the meal at Dona Maria dos Anjos’s calmed her down; not that it filled her with great satisfaction, because that wasn’t the case at all. Dona Benedita was not her usual self; she was cold and brusque, or almost brusque; she, however, explained the difference in her own terms, mentioning the threatened migraine, which was not exactly good news, but nevertheless cheered Dona Maria dos Anjos, for this refined and profound reason: it was better that her friend’s coolness was the result of an illness than a diminution in her affections.",CO107CL10
11228,132,"Moreover, it was nothing grave. And yet grave it was! There were no clasped hands, no loving gazes, no delicate titbits being consumed between fond caresses; in short, it was nothing like the dinner on Sunday. The meal was merely polite, not joyful; that was the most the canon could achieve. Oh, the kind, amiable canon!",CO107CL10
11229,133,"Eulália’s mood that day filled him with hope; her playful laughter, her easy conversation, her readiness to do as asked, to play and sing, and the tender, agreeable look on her face when she listened and spoke to Leandrinho; all this greatly restored the canon’s hopes. And for Dona Benedita to be indisposed today of all days! It really was bad luck.",CO107CL10
11230,134,"Dona Benedita’s spirits rose somewhat that evening after dinner. She talked a little more, discussed a plan to go for a stroll in the Jardim Botânico, even proposing that they go the very next day. However, Eulália warned her that it would be wise to wait a day or two for the effects of the migraine to wear off completely; and the look she got from her mother in return for her advice was as sharp as a dagger. The daughter had no fear of her mother’s eyes, though. As she brushed her hair that night, thinking over the day’s events, Eulália repeated to herself the words we heard her say, some days before, at the window.",CO107CL10
11231,135,“This can’t go on.”,CO107CL10
11232,136,"And before sleeping, she smugly pulled open a certain drawer, took out a little box, opened it, and removed a card measuring only about two inches by two—a portrait. It was clearly not the portrait of a woman, not only on account of the mustache, but also the uniform; he was, at the very least, a naval officer. Whether handsome or ugly is a matter of opinion. Eulália thought him handsome, the proof being that she kissed the portrait, not once but three times. Then she gazed at it longingly, and put it back in its box.",CO107CL10
11233,137,"What were you thinking, O strict and cautious mother, that you did not come and tear from the hands and lips of your daughter so subtle and mortal a venom? Standing at her window, Dona Benedita was gazing up at the night sky, amid the stars and gas lamps, with a roving, restless imagination, and filled with gnawing regrets and desires. Nothing had gone right for her since morning. Dona Benedita confessed, in the sweet intimacy of her own soul, that the dinner at Dona Maria dos Anjos’s had been dreadful, and that her friend probably wasn’t at her best, either.",CO107CL10
11234,138,"She felt certain regrets—although for what, she wasn’t entirely sure—and certain desires, but for quite what, she didn’t know. From time to time she gave a long, lazy yawn, like someone about to fall asleep; but if she felt anything at all it was boredom—boredom, impatience, and curiosity. Dona Benedita seriously wondered about going to join her husband; and no sooner had the thought of her husband entered her head than her heart was filled with longings and remorse, and her blood pulsed in her veins; so great was her desire to go and see the eminent judge that if her luggage had been packed and the northbound steamer had been waiting at the corner of the street, she would have embarked that very minute.",CO107CL10
11235,139,"No matter; there was sure to be another steamer in a week or ten days, and there was plenty of time to arrange her luggage. Since she would only be going for three months, she would not need to take very much. It would be a relief to get away from Rio, from the sameness of the days, the lack of novelties, the same faces, even the unchanging fashions—something that always troubled her: “Why should any fashion last for more than two weeks?”",CO107CL10
11236,140,"“I’ll go; there’s nothing more to be said. I’ll go to Pará,” she said softly.",CO107CL10
11237,141,"Indeed, the following morning, the first thing she did was to communicate this decision to her daughter, who took the news calmly. Dona Bene­dita checked how many trunks she already had, wondered if she needed one more, calculated the size, and decided to buy another. In a sudden moment of inspiration, Eulália said:",CO107CL10
11238,142,"“But Mama, we’re only going for three months, aren’t we?”",CO107CL10
11239,143,"“Yes, three . . . or possibly two.”",CO107CL10
11240,144,"“Well, then, it isn’t worth it. Two trunks will suffice.”",CO107CL10
11241,145,"“No, they won’t.”",CO107CL10
11242,146,"“Well, if they aren’t enough, we can always buy another one just before we leave. And you should go and choose it yourself—that would be much better than sending someone who knows nothing about trunks.”",CO107CL10
11243,147,"Dona Benedita thought this wise advice, and held on to her money. Her daughter smiled secretly. Perhaps she was repeating to herself the same words she had spoken at the window: “This can’t go on.” Her mother went to make arrangements, choosing clothes, making lists of things she needed to buy, a present for her husband, and so on. Oh, he would be so happy! In the afternoon, they went out to place orders, pay visits, buy tickets—four tickets, since they would each take a slave-woman with them.",CO107CL10
11244,148,"Eulália tried again to dissuade her, proposing that they delay the journey, but Dona Benedita declared that this was out of the question. At the offices of the steamship company, she was informed that the northbound steamer would leave on Friday of the following week. She asked for four tickets, opened her purse, pulled out a banknote, then two, then thought for a moment.",CO107CL10
11245,149,"“We could just buy our tickets the day before, couldn’t we?”",CO107CL10
11246,150,"“You could, but there might not be any tickets left.”",CO107CL10
11247,151,"“All right, what if you set aside four tickets for us, and I’ll send for them.”",CO107CL10
11248,152,“Your name?”,CO107CL10
11249,153,"“My name? No, better not take my name. We’ll come back three days before the steamer leaves. There are sure to be tickets then.”",CO107CL10
11250,154,“Possibly.”,CO107CL10
11251,155,"“No, there will be.”",CO107CL10
11252,156,"Once out in the street, Eulália remarked that it would be better to buy the tickets straightaway; and, since we know that she did not wish to travel either North or South, save on the frigate carrying the man we saw in that portrait the previous evening, one must assume that the young lady’s comment was profoundly Machiavellian. It wouldn’t surprise me. Dona Benedita, meanwhile, informed her friends and acquaintances of their forthcoming journey and none of them was surprised.",CO107CL10
11253,157,"One did ask if, this time, she really was going. Dona Maria dos Anjos had heard about the proposed trip from the canon, but the only thing that alarmed her when her friend came to say goodbye was Dona Benedita’s icy demeanor, her silence and indifference, and the way she kept her gaze fixed on the floor. A visit of barely ten minutes, during which Dona Benedita said only six words at the beginning:",CO107CL10
11254,158,“We are going to the North.”,CO107CL10
11255,159,And one at the end:,CO107CL10
11256,160,“Farewell.”,CO107CL10

11258,162,Chapter IV,CO107CL10
11259,163,"The journey did not take place, for superstitious reasons. On the Sunday night, Dona Benedita realized that the steamer would be leaving on a Friday, which seemed to her a bad day to travel. They would go instead on the next steamer. However, they did not go on the next one, but this time her reasons lay entirely beyond the reach of human understanding; in such cases, the best advice is not to attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible. The fact of the matter is that Dona Benedita did not go, saying that she would go on the third steamer, unless, of course, something happened to change her plans.",CO107CL10
11260,164,"Her daughter had come up with a party and a new friendship. The new friendship was with a family in Andaraí; no one knows what the party was for, but it must have been a splendid affair, because Dona Benedita was still talking about it three days later. Three days! It really was too much. As for the family, they could not have been kinder; the whole thing had made the most tremendous impression on Dona Benedita. I use this superlative because she herself used it: a document made by human hands.",CO107CL10
11261,165,“Those people made the most tremendous impression on me.”,CO107CL10
11262,166,"And she began going for strolls in Andaraí, enchanted by the company of Dona Petronilha, Counselor Beltrão’s wife, and her sister Dona Maricota, who was going to marry a naval officer, the brother of that other naval officer whose mustache, eyes, hair, and bearing match those of the portrait the reader glimpsed earlier in that drawer. The married sister was thirty-two, and her earnestness and charming manners entirely bewitched Dona Benedita. The unmarried sister was a flower, a wax flower, another expression of Dona Benedita’s, which I have left unaltered for fear of watering down the truth.",CO107CL10
11263,167,"One of the most obscure aspects of this whole curious story is the speed with which friendships blossomed and events unfurled. For example, another regular visitor to Andaraí, along with Dona Benedita, was the very naval officer pictured on that little card. He was First Lieutenant Mascarenhas, whom Counselor Beltrão predicted would become an admiral.",CO107CL10
11264,168,"Note, however, the officer’s perfidy: he came in uniform; and Dona Benedita, who adored any new spectacle, found him so distinguished, so handsome compared with the other men in civilian clothes, that she preferred him to all of them, and told him so. The officer thanked her earnestly. She told him he must come and see them; he begged permission to pay a visit.",CO107CL10
11265,169,"“A visit? Why, you must come and dine with us.”",CO107CL10
11266,170,Mascarenhas assented with a bow.,CO107CL10
11267,171,"“Look here,” said Dona Benedita, “why don’t you come tomorrow?”",CO107CL10
11268,172,"Mascarenhas came, and came early. Dona Benedita talked to him about life at sea; he asked for her daughter’s hand in marriage. Dona Benedita was speechless, indeed shocked. She remembered, it is true, that, one day in Laranjeiras some time ago, she’d had her suspicions about him, but now her suspicions were long gone. Since then, she hadn’t seen the couple speak or look at one another even once. But marriage! Was that possible? It could not be anything else; the young man’s serious, respectful, and imploring behavior said clearly that he had indeed meant marriage. A dream come true!",CO107CL10
11269,173,"To invite to one’s home a friend, and open the door to a son-in-law: it was the very height of the unexpected. And the dream was a handsome one; the naval officer was a courteous young man; strong, elegant, friendly, openhearted, and, more importantly, he seemed to adore her, Dona Benedita. What a magnificent dream! Once she had recovered from her astonishment, Dona Benedita said, yes, Eulália was his. Mascarenhas took her hand and kissed it with filial devotion.",CO107CL10
11270,174,“But what of your husband?” he asked.,CO107CL10
11271,175,“My husband will agree with me.”,CO107CL10
11272,176,"Everything proceeded at great speed. Certificates were obtained, banns were read, and a date for the wedding set; it would take place twenty-four hours after the judge’s response was received. Dona Benedita, the good, kind mother, was beside herself with joy, busily caught up in preparing the trousseau, in planning and ordering the festivities, in choosing the guests! She rushed hither and thither, sometimes on foot, sometimes by carriage, come rain or shine.",CO107CL10
11273,177,"She did not linger over any one thing for very long; one day it was the trousseau, the next it was preparations for the wedding reception, the next there were visits to be made; she switched from one thing to another, then back again, and it was all somewhat frenetic. But the daughter was always there to make up for any shortcomings, to correct any mistakes, and trim back any excesses, with her own natural talent for such things. Unlike other bridegrooms, the naval officer did not get in their way; he did not take up Dona Benedita’s invitation to dine with them every evening; he dined with them only on Sundays, and paid them a visit once a week.",CO107CL10
11274,178,"He kept in touch through long, secret letters, as he had during their courtship. Dona Benedita could not explain such diffidence when she herself had fallen head over heels in love with him; and she would avenge his strange behavior by falling even deeper in love, and telling everyone the most wonderful things about him.",CO107CL10
11275,179,“A pearl! An absolute pearl!”,CO107CL10
11276,180,"“He’s certainly a fine young man,” they all agreed.",CO107CL10
11277,181,“Isn’t he just? First-rate!”,CO107CL10
11278,182,"She repeated the same thing in the letters she wrote her husband, both before and after receiving his reply to her first letter. In that reply the eminent judge gave his consent, adding that it pained him greatly that, due to a slight indisposition, he would be unable to attend the nuptials; however, he gave them his paternal blessing, and asked for a portrait of his new son-in-law.",CO107CL10
11279,183,"His wishes were followed to the letter. The wedding took place twenty-four hours after his letter arrived from Pará. It was, as Dona Benedita told certain friends later on, an admirable, splendid affair. Canon Roxo officiated, and it goes without saying that Dona Maria dos Anjos was not present, still less her son. Up until the very last minute, she had expected to receive a wedding announcement, an invitation, or perhaps a visit, even if she would, naturally enough, refrain from actually attending the ceremony; but nothing came.",CO107CL10
11280,184,"She was frankly astonished, and scoured her memory again and again for some inadvertent slight on her part that could explain this new coolness. Finding nothing, she imagined some intrigue. But she imagined wrongly, for it was a simple oversight. On the day of the wedding, it suddenly occurred to Dona Benedita that she had forgotten to send Dona Maria dos Anjos a wedding announcement.",CO107CL10
11281,185,"“Eulália, it seems we didn’t send the announcement to Dona Maria dos Anjos,” she said to her daughter over breakfast.",CO107CL10
11282,186,"“I don’t know, Mama. It was you who organized the invitations.”",CO107CL10
11283,187,"“Well, it seems that I didn’t,” said Dona Benedita. “More sugar, João.”",CO107CL10
11284,188,"The footman handed her the sugar, and, stirring her tea, she remembered the carriage that would be going to fetch the canon, and repeated one of the orders she had given the day before.",CO107CL10
11285,189,"But fortune is a capricious thing. Two weeks after the wedding, they received news of the judge’s death. I will not describe Dona Benedita’s grief; it was deep and sincere. The young newlyweds, lost in their own world up in Tijuca, came down to see her; Dona Benedita wept the tears of a heartbroken and devotedly faithful wife. After the seventh-day mass, she consulted her daughter and son-in-law on the idea of her going to Pará and having a tomb built for her husband, where she could kiss the earth in which he now lay.",CO107CL10

Dona Benedita resisted somewhat, but accepted the three-month delay, meanwhile setting about giving all the necessary instructions for the building of the tomb. And so the tomb was built, but Mascarenhas’s commission did not materialize, and Dona Benedita was unable to go.",CO107CL10
11287,191,"Five months later, there occurred a small family incident. Dona Bene­dita had arranged to build a house on the road to Tijuca, and her son-in-law, using an interruption in the building work as a pretext, proposed that he should finish it. Dona Benedita agreed, and her agreement was all the more to her credit given that she was finding her son-in-law increasingly unbearable with his love of discipline, his obstinacy and impertinence. In fact, he didn’t need to be obstinate; rather, he had only to rely on his mother-in-law’s good nature and merely wait a few days for her to give in. But perhaps it was precisely this that vexed her. Happily, the government decided to dispatch him to the South, and the pregnant Eulália stayed with her mother.",CO107CL10
11288,192,"It was around this time that a widowed merchant took it upon himself to ask Dona Benedita for her hand in marriage. The first year of widowhood had passed. Dona Benedita received his proposal kindly, albeit with little enthusiasm. She looked to her own interests; her son’s age and studies would soon take him away to São Paulo, leaving her all alone in the world. The marriage would be a source of consolation and company. In her own mind, at home or out and about, she developed the idea, adorning it with her quick and lively imagination; it would be a new life for her, for it could be said that she had been a widow for a long time, even before her husband’s death. The merchant had a sound reputation: it would be an excellent choice.",CO107CL10
11289,193,"She did not marry. Her son-in-law returned from the South, her daughter gave birth to a strong, beautiful baby boy, who became his grandmother’s passion for the next few months. Then her son-in-law, daughter, and grandson all left for the North. Dona Benedita found herself alone and sad; her son was not enough to fill her affections. Once again the idea of traveling glimmered briefly in her mind, but only like a match that quickly burned out. Traveling alone would be tiring and dull; she decided it was better to stay.",CO107CL10

11292,196,"One night, as Dona Benedita was turning this problem over in her mind while standing at the window of the house on the shore at Botafogo, where she had moved to some months earlier, she saw a most unusual spectacle. It began as an opaque glow, like a light filtered through frosted glass, filling the inlet of the bay beyond. Against this backdrop appeared a floating, transparent figure, wreathed in mist and veiled in shimmering reflections, its shape disappearing into thin air. The figure came right up to Dona Benedita’s windowsill, and, drowsily, in a childish voice, spoke these meaningless words:",CO107CL10

The last time was at Christmas, and it’s now May 1882.",CO145CL04

At the fifth or sixth word, she had to stop; the tears came back, so abundant and unrestrained that Dona Paula thought it best to let them have their way first. Meanwhile, she started taking off her black lace cape and removing her gloves. She was an attractive lady, elegantly dressed, proud owner of a large pair of eyes, which once upon a time must have been infinite. While her niece was crying, she carefully went to shut the door and returned to the sofa. After a few minutes Venan-cinha stopped, and told her aunt what the matter was.",CO145CL04

Her husband had taken a dislike to a certain individual; but the previous evening, in C—’s house, seeing her dance with him twice and converse for a few minutes, he’d concluded they were flirting. He’d been sullen on the way home; in the morning, after breakfast, his anger exploded and he said harsh, cruel things to her, which she rebuffed with others equally harsh.",CO145CL04

11310,15,"All this was said rapidly, confidently and gently. Once her gloves were on, she got her cape, and her niece helped her, talking as well, and swearing that, in spite of everything, she adored Conrado. Conrado was the husband; he’d been a lawyer since 1874. As Dona Paula left, the girl showered her with kisses. It was true: she couldn’t have come at a better moment. On the way, however, it seems Dona Paula, not exactly mistrustful, but a bit concerned about what might really be happening, began to look at the incident a little sceptically; in any event, she was determined to re-establish domestic harmony.",CO145CL04
11311,16,"She got there; Conrado wasn’t in, but he soon came back, and once the first surprise was over Dona Paula didn’t have to tell him what the object of the visit was: he guessed everything. He admitted he’d overstepped the mark in some ways; in any case, he wasn’t saying his wife was at all perverse or vicious. That much was true; but she was a giddy creature, who loved idle chatter, tender looks and words softly spoken, and frivolity is one of the doors leading to sin.",CO145CL04
11312,17,"As far as the person in question was concerned, he had no doubt they were flirting. Venancinha had only recounted yesterday’s events; she’d said nothing about the other four or five times, the last one at the theatre, when they’d even created a bit of a scandal. He wasn’t about to cover up for his wife’s ineptitude. If she wanted to flirt, she’d have to reckon on doing it on her own.",CO145CL04
11313,18,"Dona Paula listened to all this in silence; then she spoke in her turn. She agreed that her niece was frivolous; it was natural at her age. A pretty girl can’t go out in the street without attracting attention, and it’s only natural she should be flattered by the admiration of others. It’s also natural that her reaction should look to others, and to her husband, like the beginning of an affair: foolishness on the one side, jealousy on the other, and everything’s explained.",CO145CL04
11314,19,"For her part, she’d just seen the girl weeping genuine tears; she’d left her inconsolable, saying she wanted to die, devastated by what he’d said to her. If, even, he only thought her frivolous, why not proceed with caution and tact, using advice and observation, sparing her the opportunities for temptation, pointing out how much damage is done to a lady’s reputation by appearing to be pleasant and affable with other men?",CO145CL04
11315,20,"The good lady spent fully twenty minutes saying these gentle words, so agreeably, that Conrado felt less agitated. True, he did resist: two or three times, so as not to slip too easily into forgiveness, he told Dona Paula it was all over between him and Venancinha. And, to spur himself on, he brought to mind all the reasons he had to mistrust his wife. Her aunt, however, ducked her head to let the wave pass, then surfaced again with her large, wise, insistent eyes. Conrado gave way reluctantly, little by little. Then Dona Paula proposed a compromise.",CO145CL04
11316,21,"‘You forgive her, make it up between you, and she can come and stay with me, in Tijuca, for a month or two: a kind of exile. During that time, I’ll take it upon myself to put her mind in order. Agreed?’",CO145CL04
11317,22,"Conrado accepted. Dona Paula, as soon as she had his word, took her leave to go and convey the good news to her niece; Conrado escorted her as far as the stairs. They shook hands; Dona Paula didn’t let go of his until she’d repeated her advice to be gentle and prudent; then she made this comment, natural enough in the circumstances:",CO145CL04

11319,24,‘He’s one Vasco Maria Portela …’,CO145CL04
11320,25,"Dona Paula went pale. What Vasco Maria Portela? An old man, an ex-diplomat, who … No, he’s in Europe, has been for a few years, retired, and he’s just been made a baron. It’s his son, recently come back, a scoundrel … Dona Paula grasped his hand and hurried downstairs. In the corridor, though she didn’t have to adjust her cape, she did so for some minutes, her hand trembling and her features somewhat perturbed. She even stopped and stared reflectively at the floor. She left; she went to see her niece, bringing the reconciliation and its extra clause with her. Venancinha accepted everything.",CO145CL04
11321,26,"Two days later they went to Tijuca. Venancinha wasn’t as happy as she’d promised she’d be, probably it was the exile, or maybe she felt a bit of nostalgia. In any case, Vasco’s name came up to Tijuca, if not in both their heads, at least in the aunt’s, where it was a kind of echo, a distant, soft sound, something that seemed to come from the times of Rosina Stoltz and the Paraná ministry.2 The diva and the minister, fragile things, were no less fragile than the happiness of youth itself – where had those three eternities gone? Ruins, nothing more, these thirty years. That was all Dona Paula had inside her, all she could see in front of her.",CO145CL04
11322,27,"It’s no secret, then, that the other Vasco, the older one, was once young too, and in love. They fell in love and got their fill of each other, in the protective shadow of marriage, for some years, and as the passing breeze keeps no record of men’s words, there’s no way of telling what was said of the affair in those days. The affair ended; it was a succession of sweet and bitter moments, of delights, of tears, of anger and ecstasy, various potions that filled the lady’s cup of passion to the brim. Dona Paula drank it dry and then turned it over so she could drink no more. Satiety brought abstinence, and with time, it was this last phase that left its mark on public opinion. Her husband died, and the years came and went. Dona Paula was now an austere, pious person, well respected and esteemed.",CO145CL04
11323,28,"It was her niece that took her thoughts back to the past. It was the analogous situation, together with the name and the blood of the same man, that brought some old memories back. Don’t forget they were in Tijuca, they were going to live together for a few weeks, and the one had to obey the other; it was a temptation, and a challenge to the memory.",CO145CL04
11324,29,"‘Is it really true we’re not going back to town for a while?’ Venancinha asked, laughing, the next morning.",CO145CL04

11326,31,"‘No, no, of course not, I’m just asking …’",CO145CL04
11327,32,"Dona Paula, laughing too, said no with her finger; then she asked her if she was missing the city below. Venancinha said no, not at all; and to underline her answer, she let the corners of her mouth drop, as if in indifference or disdain. This was insisting too much. Dona Paula had the good habit of not reading in a hurry, as if her life depended on it, but slowly, her eyes burrowing between the syllables and the letters, so as not to miss a thing – she thought her niece’s gesture too emphatic.",CO145CL04
11328,33,‘They’re in love!’ she thought.,CO145CL04
11329,34,"The discovery brought the spirit of the past back to life. Dona Paula struggled to shake off these importunate memories; but they came back, surreptitious or impetuous, just like the young girls they were, singing, dancing, up to all kinds of tricks. Dona Paula went back to the dances of old, to the endless waltzes that had everyone gasping in astonishment, to the mazurkas, which she insisted to her niece were the most graceful thing in the world, and to the theatre, the letters, and, vaguely, to the kisses; but – in all honesty – all this was like a dead chronicle, the skeleton of the story, without its soul.",CO145CL04
11330,35,"It all took place in her head. Dona Paula tried to bring her heart in tune with her head, to see if she could still feel something beyond pure mental repetition, but, however much she evoked these extinct passions, none of them came back to her. They were dead and gone.",CO145CL04
11331,36,"If she could spy into her niece’s heart, maybe she’d see her own image, and then … When this idea penetrated Dona Paula’s mind, it complicated the business of repair and cure somewhat. She was sincere, and her care was for the girl’s soul; she wanted her restored to her husband. Sinners might well want others to sin too, so as to have company on the way down to purgatory; but in this case the sin was over. Dona Paula stressed Conrado’s superiority, his virtues, but also his passions, which could lead the marriage to a bad – worse than tragic – end: he might disown her.",CO145CL04
11332,37,"Conrado, on the first visit he made to them, nine days later, confirmed the aunt’s warning; he was cold when he came in and left the same way. Venancinha was terrified. She’d hoped that the nine days of the separation might have softened him, as, in fact, they had; but he put on a mask when he came in and held back, so as not to give way too soon. And this was more salutary than anything else. The terror of losing her husband was the main element in her restoration. Even exile had less effect.",CO145CL04
11333,38,"And lo and behold, two days after the visit, when both of them were at the garden gate, ready for their usual walk, they saw a horseman approaching. Venancinha stared, gave a little cry, and ran to hide behind the wall. Dona Paula understood, and stayed where she was. She wanted to see the horseman closer to; she saw him two or three minutes later, a gallant young man, well dressed with his elegant shiny boots, dashing, upright in the saddle. He had the same face as the other Vasco; the same turn of the head, a little to the right, the same wide shoulders, the same round, deep eyes.",CO145CL04
11334,39,"That same night, Venancinha told her everything, after the first word had been dragged from her. They’d first seen one another at the races, soon after he’d arrived from Europe. Two weeks later, he was introduced to her at a dance, and he looked so handsome, with that Parisian air about him, that she mentioned him to her husband the next morning. Conrado frowned, and this was the gesture that gave her an idea she hadn’t had till then. She began to enjoy seeing him; soon after, she felt a certain agitation.",CO145CL04
11335,40,"He spoke respectfully to her, said nice things, that she was the prettiest young lady in Rio and the most elegant, that he’d heard her praises already in Paris, from some of the ladies of the Alvarenga family. He was amusing when he criticised others, and knew how to say things with feeling, like no one else. He didn’t speak of love, but he followed her with his eyes, and she, much as she tried to remove hers, couldn’t do it altogether. She began to think of him, repeatedly, with a certain interest, and when they met her heart beat faster; perhaps he saw the impression he was making on her in her face.",CO145CL04
11336,41,"Dona Paula, leaning towards her, listened to this account, of which this is just a coherent summary. All her life was in her eyes; her mouth half open, she seemed to drink her niece’s words, eagerly, as if they were a cordial. She asked for more, for her to tell her all, absolutely everything. Venancinha became more assured.",CO145CL04
11337,42,"Her aunt looked so young, her encouragement was so gentle, as if she were forgiving her beforehand; she found a confidante and a friend, in spite of some severe words mixed in with the others, motivated by an unconscious hypocrisy. I won’t call it calculation; Dona Paula was deluding herself. We might compare her to a retired general, struggling to find a little of his old ardour by listening to accounts of others’ campaigns.",CO145CL04

11347,52,"‘I don’t know what I felt,’ the girl rejoined, as her feelings loosened her tongue, ‘I don’t remember the first five minutes. I think I looked serious; in any case, I didn’t say anything to him. It seemed as if everyone was looking at us, they might have heard, and when someone greeted me with a smile, I had the idea they were laughing at me. I’ve no idea how I got down the stairs; I got into the carriage without knowing what I was doing; when I shook his hand, I let my fingers go limp. I swear to you I wished I hadn’t heard anything.",CO145CL04
11348,53,"Conrado told me he felt sleepy, and leaned back in the carriage; it was better that way, because I don’t know what I’d have said, if we’d had to go on talking. I leaned back too, but not for long; I couldn’t keep still. I looked out of the windows, and all I could see was the glare from the street lamps, and after a while not even that; I saw the corridors at the theatre, the stairs, all the people, and him right next to me, whispering those words, just three words, and I can’t say what I thought all that time; my ideas were mixed up, shaken, a revolution going on inside me …’",CO145CL04
11349,54,‘But when you got home?’,CO145CL04
11350,55,"‘At home, while I was undressing, I could think a little, but only a little. I got to sleep late, and slept badly. In the morning, my head was confused. I can’t say if I was happy or sad; I remember I was thinking about him a lot, and to put him out of my mind I promised myself I’d tell Conrado everything; but the thoughts came back again. From time to time, I thought I could hear his voice, and shuddered.",CO145CL04
11351,56,"I even remembered that when I was leaving I’d let my fingers go limp, and I felt, I don’t know how to put it, a kind of regret, a fear I’d offended him … then the desire to see him again came back … I’m sorry, Auntie; you want me to tell you everything.’",CO145CL04
11352,57,"In reply, Dona Paula squeezed her hand hard and nodded her head. At last, she’d found something of times past as she came into contact with these sensations, naïvely recounted as they were. Her eyes were half shut at one minute, as her memories lulled her – then, the next instant, sharpened with curiosity and warmth, and she listened to everything, day by day, meeting by meeting, the scene at the theatre itself, which her niece had at first hidden from her.",CO145CL04
11353,58,"And then everything else came along: hours of anxiety, of longing, of fear, hope, despondency, duplicity, sudden urges, all the turmoil of a young woman in circumstances like this – the aunt’s insatiable curiosity let nothing pass. It wasn’t a whole adultery novel, not even a chapter, just a prologue – but it was interesting and violent.",CO145CL04
11354,59,"Venancinha ended. Her aunt said nothing, withdrew into herself for a moment; then she awoke, took her niece’s hand and pulled it towards her. She didn’t speak at once; first she looked closely at all that restless, palpitating girlhood, her fresh mouth, her eyes still infinite, and only came to herself when her niece asked pardon of her once more. Dona Paula said everything that a gentle, severe mother might have said, talked of chastity, of love for her husband, of public reputation; she was so eloquent that Venancinha couldn’t hold back, and began to cry.",CO145CL04
11355,60,"Tea arrived, but there are some confidences that make tea impossible. Venancinha soon retired, and as the lights were now brighter, she went out of the room with her eyes lowered, so the servant wouldn’t see how upset she was. Dona Paula stayed, facing the table and the servant. She spent twenty minutes, not much less, drinking a cup of tea and nibbling a biscuit, and as soon as she was alone, she went to lean against the window, looking out over the garden.",CO145CL04
11356,61,"There was a little wind, the leaves moved and whispered, and even though they weren’t the same ones as years back, they still asked her: ‘Paula, do you remember the old days?’ Leaves have this particularity, you see – past generations tell the succeeding ones the things they’ve seen, so that they know everything and ask about everything. Do you remember the old days?",CO145CL04
11357,62,"She did remember, yes; but that sensation she’d just had, a mere reflection, had stopped now. In vain she repeated her niece’s words, breathing in the raw night air: it was only in her mind that she found some vestige, memories, ruins. Her heart had slowed down again; the blood was flowing at its usual rate.",CO145CL04

11373,14,"“I am indeed. Your husband is a good man, and this is just a minor tiff. Number 104, you said? Right, I’m off; wait for me here, so that the slaves don’t see you.”",CO145CL10
11374,15,"All this was said with a kind and confident fluency. After her gloves, she put on her cape, helped by her niece, who kept repeating, indeed swearing, how, despite everything, she still adored Conrado. Conrado was her husband, who had been practicing as a lawyer since 1874. Dona Paula left, taking with her many kisses from the young lady. She really could not have arrived at a more opportune moment. As she made her way to Conrado’s office, it seems that Dona Paula reflected upon the incident with curiosity and not a little suspicion, somewhat uneasy about what might really have happened; in any event, she was determined to restore domestic harmony.",CO145CL10
11375,16,"Her nephew was not in his office when she arrived, but he soon returned. Despite his initial surprise at seeing her there, he did not need Dona Paula to explain the reason for her visit; he guessed what had happened. He admitted that he had gone too far in some respects, and while he did not actually believe his wife to be a wicked or depraved woman, she was something of a flibbertigibbet, too fond of men’s gallantry, tender looks, and flattering remarks. Frivolity could itself be a doorway to vice.",CO145CL10
11376,17,"As for the man in question, he had no doubt that something was going on between them. Venancinha had only told Dona Paula about the previous night; she had not mentioned the four or five other incidents, the last of which had taken place at the theater, and had even turned into something of a scandal. He had no desire to assume responsibility for his wife’s indiscretions. If she wanted to take lovers, then so be it, but it would be at a cost.",CO145CL10
11377,18,"Dona Paula listened in silence, then she spoke. She agreed that her niece was somewhat flighty; it was only to be expected at her age. Pretty girls cannot go out into the street without attracting attention, and it was only natural for her to be flattered by the attentions of other men. It was also only natural that her response should appear, both to the flatterers and to her husband and to other people, as the beginnings of an affair: their foolishness and his jealousy explained everything.",CO145CL10
11378,19,"On the other hand, she, Dona Paula, had just seen the poor girl shed genuine tears; she had left her in a wretched state, completely distraught at what he had said to her, even saying she wanted to die. And if he himself only thought her frivolous, then why not proceed with caution and kindness, offering sage advice, avoiding as much as possible the occasions on which such incidents might arise and pointing out to her the harm that can be done to a lady’s reputation by even the appearance on her part of any reciprocity, affection, or kindness toward other men?",CO145CL10
11379,20,"The good lady spent no less than twenty minutes saying these soothing things, and so convincing were her arguments that the nephew felt his heart soften. He did, of course, put up some resistance. Not wishing to seem overly indulgent, he declared two or three times that it was all over between him and Venancinha. To stir his resolve, he brought to mind all the various grievances he held against his wife. The aunt, meanwhile, bowed her head to let the wave wash over, before again raising it and fixing him with her large, wise, perseverant eyes. Slowly and reluctantly, Conrado began to give way. It was then that Dona Paula proposed a compromise.",CO145CL10
11380,21,"“Forgive her, make peace between you, and let her come and stay with me up in Tijuca for a month or two; call it a sort of exile. While she’s with me, I will do my best to knock some sense into her. Agreed?”",CO145CL10
11381,22,"Conrado agreed. As soon as she had his word, Dona Paula bade him good day and left to take the good news to her niece. Conrado accompanied her to the stairs and they shook hands; Dona Paula did not release his without first repeating her words of prudent, compassionate advice, then commented nonchalantly:",CO145CL10
11382,23,“And the pair of you will come to see that the man who caused all this trouble doesn’t merit even a moment’s thought.”,CO145CL10
11383,24,“His name is Vasco Maria Portela.”,CO145CL10
11384,25,"Dona Paula turned pale. Which Vasco Maria Portela? An old man, a former diplomat, who . . . No, he had retired to Europe several years before and had just been made a baron. It was one of his sons, recently returned, a regular dandy . . . Dona Paula released Conrado’s hand and hurried downstairs. Although there was no need to adjust her cape, she stood in the hallway for several minutes, fumbling with it, her hands trembling, and with a somewhat troubled look on her face. She even stopped and stared down at the floor, thinking. Then she left the building and returned to her niece, taking with her the reconciliation and its conditions. Venancinha agreed to everything.",CO145CL10
11385,26,"Two days later, they left for Tijuca. Venancinha went rather less willingly than she had promised; it was probably the prospect of exile, or perhaps some lingering regrets. In any event, Vasco’s name went with them up to Tijuca, if not in both of their heads, then at least in the aunt’s, where it created a kind of distant echo, wafting gently down from the days of the great mezzo Rosine Stoltz when the Marquis of Paraná was in government. Power and fame are fragile things, and no less fragile than the bloom on a young girl’s cheek. And where had those three eternities gone? They were buried beneath the ruins of the past thirty years, which was all that Dona Paula had within her and all that lay ahead of her.",CO145CL10
11386,27,"The reader will by now have realized that the other Vasco, the older one, had also once been young and in love. For several years, in the shadow of their respective marriages, they had loved each other until they could love no more, and since the passing breeze does not record our human words, it is impossible to set down here what was said of the affair at the time. The affair ended; it had been a succession of sweet and bitter hours, of delights, tears, rages, and raptures—for such were the intoxications that filled this lady’s cup of passion. Dona Paula drank deeply, down to the very last drop, then cast the cup aside, never to drink again. Surfeit led to abstinence, and, with time, her public reputation rested on that latter phase. Her husband died and the years passed. Dona Paula was now an austere and pious widow, held in the highest esteem and respect.",CO145CL10
11387,28,"It was her niece who took her thoughts back to the past. The similarity of the situation, with a man of the same name and blood, awoke in her some old memories. Do not forget that the two of them were now up in Tijuca and would be living together for some time, one in obedience to the other; it was both a temptation and a challenge to memory.",CO145CL10
11388,29,"“Are we really not going back to the city for several weeks?” asked Venancinha, laughing, the following morning.",CO145CL10
11389,30,“Are you bored already?”,CO145CL10
11390,31,"“No, not at all, I could never be bored; I was just asking . . .”",CO145CL10
11391,32,"Dona Paula, also laughing, wagged her finger and asked if she was already missing life down in the city. Of course she wasn’t, said Venancinha, curling her lip in disdain or indifference. She did perhaps protest too much, like someone who reveals more than she should in her letters, and Dona Paula had the good sense not to read in haste, preferring to weigh each word and syllable so that nothing escaped her, and she found her niece’s gesture somewhat excessive.",CO145CL10
11392,33,“They’re in love!” she thought to herself.,CO145CL10
11393,34,"This discovery reawakened the spirit of the past. Dona Paula struggled to shake off those importunate memories, yet back they came, meek and mild or bold and blowsy, like the young things they were, singing and laughing and generally causing mayhem. Dona Paula returned to the dances of her youth, to those endless waltzes that sent everyone into raptures, to the mazurkas, which she always held up to her niece as the most graceful thing in the world, to the theaters, the card games, and, more circumspectly, the kisses; but all of these things—and here’s the nub of it—all of these things were like dry, dusty chronicles, mere skeletons of the story, lacking any soul.",CO145CL10
11394,35,"It was all in her head. Dona Paula tried to yoke her heart to her head, to see if she could feel anything beyond a purely mental reenactment, but, however hard she tried to revive those extinct emotions, none returned. Only bare stumps remained.",CO145CL10
11395,36,"If she could only peer into her niece’s heart, she might find her own image reflected there, and then . . . Once this notion entered Dona Paula’s head, it somewhat complicated her task of cure and restoration. She was sincere in her concern for her niece’s welfare, and wanted to see her reconciled with her husband. Steadfast sinners may well wish for others to sin as well, so as to have some company on the way down to purgatory, but in this case the sin was long gone. Dona Paula set out to her niece Conrado’s superior virtues, but also the passions that could bring their marriage to a bad, indeed worse than tragic, end: he could disown her.",CO145CL10
11396,37,"Conrado’s first visit to them, nine days later, only confirmed her aunt’s warnings: he was cold when he arrived and cold when he left. Venancinha was terrified. She had hoped that those nine days of separation would have softened her husband’s heart, which indeed they had, but he concealed this on arrival and kept a tight lid on his feelings so as not to be seen to be giving in. This proved more salutary than anything else. The terror of losing her husband was the most important element in Venancinha’s recovery. It was even more effective than exile.",CO145CL10
11397,38,"Then, all of a sudden, two days after Conrado’s visit, when aunt and niece were standing at the garden gate ready to go out for their customary stroll, they saw a man approaching on horseback. Venancinha stared at him, uttered a faint cry, and ran to hide behind the wall. Dona Paula understood at once, and remained where she was. She wanted to see the rider at closer quarters, and two or three minutes later she did just that: a handsome, elegant young man with gleaming boots and a firm seat in the saddle. He had the same face as the other Vasco, for he was indeed the son; the same tilt of the head, slightly to the right, the same broad shoulders, the same round, deep eyes.",CO145CL10
11398,39,"That very night, once the first word had been pried out of her, Venancinha told her aunt everything. They had first seen each other at the races, soon after he returned from Europe. Two weeks later, he was introduced to her at a ball, and he looked so dashing, had such a Parisian air about him, that the following morning she mentioned him to her husband. Conrado had frowned, and it was precisely this reaction that planted in her mind an idea that had never occurred to her up until then. She began to enjoy seeing Vasco, and soon enjoyment turned to longing.",CO145CL10
11399,40,"He spoke to her respectfully and said nice things to her, that she was the prettiest and most elegant girl in Rio, that some of the ladies of the Alvarenga family, whom he had met in Paris, had already been singing her praises to him. He made witty, cutting remarks about other mutual acquaintances, but also knew how to speak from the heart, like no one else she had met before. He did not speak of love, but followed her with his eyes, and though she tried to look away, she could not do so entirely. She began to think about him, often and with great excitement, and her heart beat faster whenever they met; and he may well have seen in the look on her face the impression he made upon her.",CO145CL10
11400,41,"Leaning toward her niece, Dona Paula listened to this account, which appears here in abbreviated form. Her whole life was there in her eyes; with her lips parted, she seemed to drink in her niece’s words, eagerly, like a cordial. She asked for more, for her to tell her everything, absolutely everything. Venancinha’s confidence grew.",CO145CL10
11401,42,"Her aunt looked so youthful, her very exhortations were so gentle and full of ready forgiveness, that Venancinha found in her a confidante and a friend, apart from the few harsh words that Dona Paula, out of unwitting hypocrisy, had felt obliged to mix in with other, kinder ones, for I wouldn’t say this was intentional, given that Dona Paula was deceiving herself as well. We might compare her to a general invalided out of the army and who tries to rekindle some of his former ardor by listening to the tales of other men’s campaigns.",CO145CL10
11402,43,"“Now you can see that your husband was right,” she said. “You’ve been reckless, very reckless . . .”",CO145CL10
11403,44,"Venancinha agreed, but swore that it was all over.",CO145CL10
11404,45,“I’m afraid it might not be. Did you really love him?”,CO145CL10
11405,46,“Auntie!”,CO145CL10
11406,47,“So you do still love him!”,CO145CL10
11407,48,"“I swear I don’t. Not anymore, but I confess . . . yes, I confess I did. Oh, Auntie, please forgive me; don’t say anything to Conrado. I’m truly sorry . . . As I said, at the beginning I was somewhat smitten . . . But what can you expect?”",CO145CL10
11408,49,“Did he make any declarations of love?”,CO145CL10
11409,50,"“Yes, one night at the theater, the Teatro Lírico, as we were leaving. He had the habit of calling at our box to accompany me to my carriage. It was at the door to the box . . . just three little words . . .”",CO145CL10
11410,51,"Dona Paula did not, for the sake of decency, ask Venancinha what the precise words of her lover had been, but she imagined the setting, the corridor, the couples leaving, the lights, the crowd, the chatter of voices. With this tableau before her, she was able to imagine some of her niece’s feelings; astutely, and not entirely disinterestedly, she asked her to describe them.",CO145CL10
11411,52,"“I don’t know what I felt,” replied the young lady, whose tongue was loosening with her swelling emotions. “I don’t remember the first five minutes. I think I remained composed, though, and I certainly didn’t respond. Everyone seemed to be looking at us, as if they’d overheard something, and when someone greeted me with a smile, I had the impression they were making fun of me. Somehow I made it down the stairs, and without really knowing what I was doing, I got into the carriage; when we shook hands I let my fingers go limp. I swear to you I wish I hadn’t heard those words.",CO145CL10
11412,53,"Conrado told me he was sleepy and leaned back in the carriage; it was better that way, because I don’t know what I would have said if we’d had to talk all the way home. I leaned back, too, but not for long; I couldn’t keep still. I looked out of the window and could see only the glare of the streetlamps, and then not even that; I saw the corridors at the theater, the stairs, everyone standing there, him right beside me, whispering those words, just three little words, and I cannot say what I thought during all that time; everything inside me was mixed up and confused, like a kind of internal revolution . . .”",CO145CL10
11413,54,“And when you got home?”,CO145CL10
11414,55,"“At home, as I undressed, I was able to gather my thoughts a little, but only a little. I slept poorly, and late. I woke in the morning feeling utterly confused. I can’t say whether I was happy or sad; I remember thinking about him a lot, and to put him out of my mind I promised myself that I would tell Conrado everything, but the thoughts kept coming back. From time to time, I could almost hear his voice, and it made me tremble.",CO145CL10
11415,56,"Then I remembered that, when we said goodbye, I had let my fingers go limp, and I felt, I don’t quite know how to put it, a sort of regret, a fear of having offended him . . . and that made me want to see him again . . . Forgive me, Auntie, but you did ask me to tell you everything.”",CO145CL10
11416,57,"Dona Paula nodded and squeezed her niece’s hand tightly. Hearing those feelings so innocently expressed, she had at last rediscovered something from the old days. One minute her eyes were dull with the drowsiness of remembrance, the next instant they sparkled with warmth and curiosity; she listened to everything, day by day, encounter by encounter, the scene at the theater itself, which, at first, her niece had hidden from her.",CO145CL10
11417,58,"And then came the rest, the hours of anguish, of longing, fear, hope, the disappointments, the deceptions, the sudden impulses, all the turmoil of any young woman in such circumstances; nothing was spared the aunt’s insatiable curiosity. It was not an entire book, not even one chapter of an adultery, but a prologue—interesting and disturbing.",CO145CL10
11418,59,"Venancinha finished speaking. Lost in her own thoughts, her aunt said nothing. Then she stirred from her reverie, took her niece’s hand, and drew it toward her. She still didn’t speak; at first she just stared intently at all that restless, quivering youthfulness, the fresh mouth, the still-infinite eyes, and only came to herself when her niece asked once again for her forgiveness. Dona Paula said to her everything that a tender, austere mother could say; she spoke of chastity, of love for her husband, of public reputation; she was so eloquent that Venancinha could not contain herself, and wept.",CO145CL10
11419,60,"Tea was brought in, but after certain confidences tea is impossible. Venancinha quickly withdrew to her room and, now that more candles had been lit, she left the room with her eyes lowered so that the footman would not see how upset she was. Dona Paula remained at the table, as did the footman. She spent nearly twenty minutes sipping a cup of tea and nibbling a biscuit, and as soon as she was alone, she went and leaned against the window, which looked out over the garden.",CO145CL10
11420,61,"A gentle breeze was blowing; the leaves stirred and whispered, and even though they were not the same leaves as in times gone by, they still asked her: “Do you remember the old days, Paula?” For that is the peculiar thing about leaves: each passing generation tells the next what it has seen, and so they always know everything and ask about everything. “Do you remember the old days?”",CO145CL10
11421,62,"Yes, she did remember, but what she had felt only a short time earlier, a mere shadow, had now passed. In vain she repeated her niece’s words, breathing in the sharp night air: it was only in her head that she found some remnants, mere reminiscences, bare stumps. Her heart had slowed once again and her blood was flowing at its normal pace.",CO145CL10
11422,63,"She lacked her niece’s moral presence. And yet there she stood, staring into the night, which was just the same as all those other nights and yet had nothing in common with the days of Rosine Stoltz and the Marquis of Paraná; and there she stood, while inside the house the slave-women staved off sleep by telling stories and occasionally, growing impatient, saying to each other:",CO145CL10

11425,2,When I was chaplain of São Francisco de Paula Church (an old priest was narrating) an extraordinary experience happened to me.,CO174CL07
11426,3,"I lived next to the Church, and one night I retired late. I never retire late without first checking to see if the temple’s doors were completely closed. I did find them to be completely closed but I glimpsed some light coming from beneath the portals. Frightened I ran in search of the night patrol making their rounds; I couldn’t find them, so I came back and remained in the plaza in front of the Church without knowing what to do.",CO174CL07
11427,4,"The light, without being very intense, was too bright for it to be thieves; besides, I noticed it was steady and remained the same, didn’t move from one side to the other, as would the light from the candles or lanterns of people who were stealing. The mystery distressed me; I went to look for the keys to the sacristy (the sacristan had gone to spend the night in Niteroi). First I crossed myself, opened the door and entered.",CO174CL07
11428,5,"The corridor was dark. I brought a lantern with me and stepped very slowly, silencing the sound of my shoes as much as I could. The first and the second doors leading into the Church were closed; but the same light could be seen and, perchance, it was more intense than the street side. I kept advancing, until I came upon the third door, open. I placed the lantern in a corner, covering it with my handkerchief so as not to be seen from the inside, and then got closer in order to spy upon what was occurring.",CO174CL07
11429,6,"I stopped right away. In effect, I only then noticed that I had come completely unarmed and was taking a big risk appearing inside the Church with no more defense than my own two hands. A few minutes passed. In the Church the light remained the same, stable and everywhere, and more of a milky-white color than the light from the candles. Also I heard voices which flustered me even more, neither whispered nor vague, but regular, clear and tranquil as in a conversation.",CO174CL07
11430,7,"At first I couldn’t understand what they were saying. In the middle of this, an idea took hold of me that made me recoil. Since in those times cadavers were entombed in churches, I imagined that deceased souls were actually having a conversation. I stepped back terrified and only after some time had passed was I able to act and again reach the door, saying to myself that any such idea was nonsense. However, reality was going to offer me something more frightening than a dialogue of the dead. I entrusted myself to God, crossed myself again and kept on walking furtively, leaning against the wall, until I went in. I then saw an extraordinary thing.",CO174CL07
11431,8,"Two of the three saints on the opposite side, São José and São Miguel (to the right for those who entered the Church from the front doors), had descended from their niches and were seated at their altars. Their dimensions were not those of their carved images, but of human size. They were speaking toward this side of the Church where the altars of São João Batista and São Francisco de Sales are located. I cannot describe what I felt.",CO174CL07
11432,9,"For some time I cannot seem to calculate, I stood without moving forwards or backwards, terrified and tremulous. I was sure I was on the verge of falling into the abyss of madness, and most assuredly didn’t fall due to divine mercy. That I became unconscious of my actual self and all other reality except for that scene, so new and so unique, I can definitely affirm; only in this way can one explain the foolishness I displayed, a little while later, by entering deeper into the Church, with the purpose of also looking at the opposite side. I saw the same thing: São Francisco de Sales and São João, descended from their niches, seated at their altars and conversing with the other saints.",CO174CL07
11433,10,"My stupefaction was such that they continued to talk, I believe, without my even hearing the sound of their voices. Little by little I heard them better and was able to understand that they had not interrupted their conversation. I distinguished one from the other, I clearly heard their words, but I could not grasp the meaning right away.",CO174CL07
11434,11,"One of the saints, speaking toward the main altar, made me turn my head and then I saw that São Francisco de Paula, the Church’s patron saint had done the same as the others and was speaking to them, as they were conversing among themselves. The voices didn’t go higher than middle range and, yet, one could hear them very well, as if sound waves had acquired a greater power of transmission.",CO174CL07
11435,12,"However, if all this was astonishing, the light was no less so, coming from nowhere because the chandeliers and candles were all snuffed out; it was as though moonlight had penetrated the place without one being able to see the moon; a comparison so much more exact that, if it were truly moonlight, it would have left some places dark, as was happening there, and within one of those dark spots I took refuge.",CO174CL07
11436,13,"By then I was proceeding automatically. The life I lived during this whole period of time didn’t seem like my other life, before and after. Suffice to say that, facing such a strange spectacle, I became absolutely fearless; I lost the ability for reflection, I only knew how to hear and contemplate.",CO174CL07
11437,14,"I understood after some moments that they were doing inventory and commenting on that day’s prayers and implorations. Each one took note of something. All of them, terrible psychologists, had penetrated the souls and lives of the faithful and were tearing apart the sentiments of each one, like anatomists dissecting a cadaver. São João Batista and São Francisco de Paula, tough ascetics, sometimes showed themselves to be stuffy and absolute. São Francisco de Sales was not like that; he heard or said things with the same forgiveness that had permeated his famous book on the Introduction to the Devout Life.",CO174CL07
11438,15,"According to each one’s temperament, they went on narrating and commenting. They had already talked about cases of sincere and genuine faith, other cases about indifference, dissimulation and inconstancy; the two ascetics became more and more annoyed, but São Francisco de Sales reminded them about the verses in Scripture: many are called but few are chosen, meaning that not all those who went to that Church harbored a pure heart. São João was shaking his head.",CO174CL07

Look, just today something happened here that made me smile but, on the other hand, might make you angry.

11445,22,"“Could be,” interrupted São José, “But it certainly will not be more interesting than the adulteress who came here to prostrate herself at my feet. She came to ask me to wipe her heart clean of the leprosy of lust. Just yesterday she had fought with her boyfriend, who hurt her shamefully and she spent the night in tears. In the morning, she was determined to leave him and came here in search of the strength needed to escape from the claws of the demon.",CO174CL07
11446,23,"She started to pray well enough, sincerely; but little by little I saw that her mind was letting her return to her old delights. At the same time, her words were becoming meaningless. By then the prayer was lukewarm, afterwards cold, then unconscious; her lips, inured to prayer, kept on praying; but her soul, which I was spying upon from up here was no longer present, it was back with the other person. Finally, she stood up, crossed herself and left without asking for anything.”",CO174CL07

11450,27,"All the saints kept quiet, their torsos bent forward, attentive, waiting. At this point I became frightened; I remembered that they, who see everything going on inside us, as if we were made of glass, hidden thoughts, twisted intentions, secret hatreds, could very well have already read inside me some sin or the beginning of a sin.

11454,31,"Sometimes, in the dead of night, he contemplates his money for a few minutes, and then quickly locks it up again; but during these nights he doesn’t sleep, or sleeps badly. He has no children. The life he leads is sordid; in order not to die, he eats little and very bad food. The family is comprised of his wife and a black slave woman, purchased with another one, furtively, many years ago; they being contraband. . . ”",CO174CL07
11455,32,They say that he didn’t even pay for them because the seller died right after without leaving anything recorded. The other black died a little while ago; and now you will learn whether or not this man has the talent for economy – Sales liberated the cadaver .,CO174CL07
11456,33,And the holy bishop said no more in order to savor the others’ astonishment.,CO174CL07
11457,34,“The cadaver?”,CO174CL07
11458,35,"“Yes, the cadaver. He had the slave buried as a free but destitute person, so as not to incur expenses for a tombstone. Even though it cost him just a little, he saved some money. Only a little, but it was something. And for him there is nothing too little; with raindrops the streets become wet. No desire for someone to represent him, no taste for noble titles; all that costs money, and he says that money does not fall from the sky. Little sociability, no family recreation. He listens to and tells anecdotes about other people’s lives which costs nothing.”",CO174CL07
11459,36,"“One can understand the public’s skepticism,” pondered São Miguel.",CO174CL07
11460,37,"“I can’t deny that, because the world doesn’t venture beyond the surface of things. The world doesn’t see that, besides being a prominent housekeeper trained by him, and his confidant for more than twenty years, the wife of this Sales is truly loved by her husband. Don’t be shocked, Miguel; alongside that rough garden wall blossomed a pale and unscented flower but still a flower. Sentimental botany has these anomalies. Sales loves his wife; he’s depressed and frantic about the idea of losing her. This morning, very early, not having slept for more than two hours he began to think about the oncoming disaster.",CO174CL07
11461,38,"Feeling desperate about the world, he turned to God; he thought about us, and especially me, the saint with his name. Only a miracle could save her; so he decided to come here. He lives nearby, and he came running. When he entered he had a bright and hopeful look; it could be the light of God but it was something else very particular that I’m going to describe. Here I implore you to sharpen your attention.”",CO174CL07
11462,39,"I saw their torsos bend forward even more; I myself could not avoid the movement and took one step forward. The saint’s narration was so long and detailed, the analysis so complicated that I’m not going to relate it here entirely, but just its substance.",CO174CL07
11463,40,"“When he thought about coming here to beg my intercession for his wife’s life, Sales had a typical usurer’s idea, to make me a vow of an ex-voto leg made of wax. It wasn’t the believer who in this way symbolizes the memento of a good deed; it was the usurer who thought of forcing divine grace with the expectation of profit.",CO174CL07
11464,41,"And it was not only usury that spoke, but also greed; because in truth, being open to the vow, he showed he truly wanted to save his wife’s life—miser’s intuition; to spend is to document: one only deeply desires that which one pays for with money, his conscience said to him with the same dark speech. Know that such thoughts are not formulated like others, they are born from the entrails of character and remain in the penumbra of consciousness. But I read him inside-out and as soon as he entered here all excited with a resplendent look of hope; I read everything and waited for him to finish blessing himself and praying.”",CO174CL07
11465,42,"“At least he has some religious faith,” pondered São José.",CO174CL07
11466,43,"“He does have some, but it’s vague and spare. He was never a member of brotherhoods and third orders because inside these groups one robs what belongs to God; that’s what he says in order to reconcile devotion with his pocket. But one cannot have everything; for sure he fears God and believes in His doctrine.”",CO174CL07
11467,44,“Then he knelt down and prayed.”,CO174CL07
11468,45,"“He prayed. While he was praying, I saw his poor soul, truly suffering, though his hope began to change into intuitive assurance. God had to save the sick woman, out of necessity, thanks to my intervention and I was going to intercede; that’s what he was thinking, while his lips repeated the words of the prayer. Finishing his prayer, Sales stayed there gazing for some time with his hands together; finally the man’s mouth opened, he spoke to confess his pain, to swear that no other hand, besides God’s, could thwart the final blow. His wife was going to die . . . she was going to die . . . she was going to die . . .",CO174CL07
11469,46,"And he repeated the words without being free of them. His wife was going to die. He couldn’t go beyond that. Ready to formulate his request and the vow, he still could not find the suitable words, not even close, not even hesitant, he couldn’t say anything, indicating how long he had been unaccustomed to giving something. Finally the request blurted out; his wife was going to die, he begged me to save her, that I ask God on her behalf. The vow itself, however, was just not coming out. At the moment his mouth was about to articulate the first word, the claw of greed cut into his entrails and wouldn’t let anything out. That I save her . . . that I intercede for her . . .”",CO174CL07
11470,47,"In the air, before his eyes, the wax leg was being sculpted for him and immediately the money that it would cost came to mind. The leg disappeared but the coin remained, round, shiny, yellow, pure gold, completely gold, better than the merely gold-plated candlesticks on my altar. Wherever he turned his eyes, he saw the coin, spinning, spinning, spinning.",CO174CL07
11471,48,"And his eyes felt it, from afar, and transmitted to him the cold sensation of metal and even the bas-relief of the seal. It was the real thing, an old friend from many years back, companion by day and night, there it was turning in the air, spinning, dizzily; it was the coin that descended from the ceiling or ascended from the floor or rolled around the altar, going from the Epistle to the Gospel, or tinkling in the prisms of the chandelier.",CO174CL07
11472,49,"Now the supplication in his eyes and their melancholy were more intense and completely voluntary. I saw them stretched out to me, replete with contrition, humiliation, destitution; and his mouth kept saying some things freely,--God,--the angels of the Lord, --the holy wounds of Christ--tearful and tremulous words, as an artist painting the sincerity of his faith and the immensity of his pain.",CO174CL07
11473,50,"Only the vow of the wax leg was not forthcoming. At times, his soul, as a person who gathers his forces in order to jump over a rampart, contemplated his wife’s death for a long time and thrashed about in the despair that her passing would bring; but, on the edge of the rampart when he was about to jump, he retreated. The image of the gold coin emerged from within himself and the vow remained within the man’s heart.",CO174CL07
11474,51,"Time was passing. The hallucination grew because the coin, accelerating and multiplying its spins, multiplied itself and seemed like a an infinity of coins; and the dilemma became more and more tragic. Suddenly, the fear that his wife could be expiring froze the poor man’s blood and he wanted to plunge headlong. She could be expiring . . . He kept asking me to intercede on her behalf, that I save her . . .",CO174CL07
11475,52,"At this point the demon of greed suggested to him a new transaction, a kind of exchange, telling him that the value of prayer was very high and much more sublime than that of earthly deeds. And Sales, bent over, contrite, with his hands together, a submissive look, forsaken, resigned, asked me to save his wife. That I save his wife and he made me a vow of three hundred—nothing less—three hundred Our-Fathers and three hundred Hail-Marys. He emphatically repeated: three hundred, three hundred, three hundred . . .",CO174CL07
11476,53,"The price kept rising, it got to five hundred and then to a thousand Our-Fathers and a thousand Hail-Marys. He didn’t envisage this sum written in letters of the alphabet, but in numerals, as if in this way the sum were more vivid, more exact, and the obligation bigger, and also bigger the enticement. One thousand Our-Fathers, one thousand Hail-Marys. Then the tearful and tremulous words returned, the holy wounds, the angels of the Lord . . . 1,000 – 1,000 – 1,000.",CO174CL07

11478,55,"And the other saints truly laughed, not that huge indecorous laughter of Homer’s gods when they saw the crippled Vulcan serve at table, but in a modest, tranquil, holy, and catholic laugh.",CO174CL07
11479,56,"Afterwards, I couldn’t hear anything else. I toppled completely to the ground. When I became aware of myself it was daylight . . . I ran to open all the doors and windows of the Church and the sacristy to let in the sun, enemy of bad dreams.",CO174CL07

11481,2,"WHEN I WAS CHAPLAIN at the Church of São Francisco de Paula (an elderly priest told me), the most extraordinary thing happened to me.",CO174CL10
11482,3,"I lived right by the church, and one night, I retired to bed rather late. I would never, of course, go to bed without first checking to see that the church doors were properly locked. And so they were, but beneath them I could see a light. Frightened, I ran to fetch the night watchman, and when I couldn’t find him, I went back to the church steps and waited, not knowing what to do.",CO174CL10
11483,4,"The light wasn’t very bright, but still far too bright for thieves; besides, I noticed that it shone with a steady, even glow rather than wandering from side to side, as would be the case with the candles or lanterns of persons intent on stealing. The mystery intrigued me, and I went home to fetch the keys to the sacristy (the sacristan having gone to spend the night in Niterói), then, having made the sign of the cross, I unlocked the door and went inside.",CO174CL10
11484,5,"The passageway lay in darkness. Holding my lantern, I edged slowly forward, trying to make as little noise as possible. The first and second doors leading into the church were shut, but under them I could see that same light; indeed, it seemed even more intense than when seen from the street. I carried on until I came to the third door, which stood open. I set the lantern down in one corner and covered it with my handkerchief so that I wouldn’t be noticed inside the church, and then I moved closer so as to find out what was going on.",CO174CL10
11485,6,"Suddenly I stopped. It was only then that I realized I had come entirely unarmed, and that entering the church with only my two hands to defend myself could prove risky. Several more minutes raced by. The light from within remained unchanged—a steady, even milky glow, quite unlike candlelight. I could hear voices now, which I found still more troubling: they were neither whispering nor mumbling, but speaking in calm, clear, measured tones, as if they were conducting a normal conversation.",CO174CL10
11486,7,"At first I couldn’t understand what they were saying, and as I listened, I was struck by a thought that made me shudder. At the time, corpses were often laid to rest inside the church, and I suddenly imagined that it might be the dead talking to each other. I shrank back in terror, and it took me some time to pull myself together and return once more to the doorway, telling myself that such ideas were mere foolish nonsense. Reality, however, was about to show me something even more astonishing than a dialogue of the dead. I commended myself to God, again made the sign of the cross, and, keeping very close to the wall, crept gingerly forward and went in. What I saw was truly extraordinary.",CO174CL10
11487,8,"Two of the three saints on the opposite side, Saint Joseph and Saint Michael (on the right as you enter the church though the main door), had stepped down from their niches and were sitting on their respective altars. They were smaller than their statues, more the size of ordinary men. They seemed to be addressing someone on my side of the church, where the altars of Saint John the Baptist and Saint Francis de Sales were located. I cannot begin to describe what went through my mind.",CO174CL10
11488,9,"For quite some time (I have no idea how long), I stood rooted to the spot, covered in goose bumps and trembling. I was teetering on the very edge of the abyss of madness, and it was only by divine mercy that I did not actually topple in. What I can, however, confirm is that I lost all consciousness of myself and of any other reality beyond the new and utterly unique reality before my eyes; only thus can I explain the boldness with which, only moments later, I advanced farther into the church, in order to see the other wall. And there the same sight greeted my eyes: Saint Francis de Sales and Saint John, having stepped down from their niches, were also sitting on their altars and conversing with the other saints.",CO174CL10
11489,10,"I was so astonished that I believe they continued talking without me even hearing the sound of their voices. Little by little, however, my senses returned and I realized that they had not once interrupted their conversation; I could clearly hear and distinguish their words, but, initially, could make no sense of them.",CO174CL10
11490,11,"When one of the saints addressed the high altar, I turned my head in that direction and saw that Saint Francis of Paola, the church’s patron saint, had also stepped down from his niche and was joining in the conversation. They weren’t speaking particularly loudly, and yet they were perfectly audible, as if the sound waves had somehow been endowed with a greater power of transmission.",CO174CL10
11491,12,"But if all this was astonishing, then so was the light: it seemed to come from nowhere, for the chandeliers and candlesticks were all unlit. It was as if moonlight had somehow found its way into the building, but with the moon itself hidden from sight; the comparison is even more exact when you consider that, if it really had been moonlight, some places would have been left in darkness, as indeed was the case, for it was in one of those dark corners that I sought refuge.",CO174CL10
11492,13,"By then I was acting purely on instinct, and what I experienced on that night bore no relation to my life before or after. Suffice it to say that, confronted by this strange spectacle, I felt absolutely no fear; I lost all power of thought and could do little more than listen and look.",CO174CL10
11493,14,"After a few moments, I realized that they were cataloguing and commenting on all of the day’s prayers and petitions. Each of them had something to contribute. All of them, with terrifying psychological insight, had penetrated into the lives and souls of the faithful and picked apart the feelings of each and every one, just as anatomists dissect a corpse. Saint John the Baptist and Saint Francis of Paola, those harsh ascetics, were, by turns, angry and absolute. Unlike Saint Francis de Sales, who listened and gave his judgments with the same kindly indulgence to be found in his famous work Introduction to the Devout Life.",CO174CL10
11494,15,"It was thus, each according to his own temperament, that they recounted and remarked on the day’s events. Examples of pure, sincere faith, of indifference, of dissembling and double-dealing, had already been laid bare; the two ascetics grew ever sadder, but Saint Francis de Sales reminded them of the words of the Scriptures: “Many are called but few are chosen,” by which he meant that not all who attended that church came with a pure heart. Saint John shook his head.",CO174CL10
11495,16,"“I must tell you, Francis de Sales, I am developing a most unusual sentiment in a saint: I’m beginning to lose my faith in humankind.”",CO174CL10
11496,17,"“Now, don’t exaggerate, John the Baptist,” replied the saintly bishop. “Let’s not get carried away. Look, something happened here today that made me smile, and yet the very same thing might well have filled you with indignation. Men are no worse now than they were in earlier centuries. Set aside all their bad qualities, and you’ll find there are many good qualities left. Believe this and you will surely smile when you hear the tale I have to tell you.”",CO174CL10
11497,18,“Me? Smile?”,CO174CL10
11498,19,"“Yes, you, John the Baptist, and you as well, Francis of Paola; in fact, it will make all of you smile. And I can tell you about it now because I have already interceded with the Lord and obtained from Him the very thing for which this person was praying.”",CO174CL10
11499,20,“Which person?”,CO174CL10
11500,21,"“Someone far more interesting than your notary, Joseph, or your storekeeper, Michael—”",CO174CL10
11501,22,"“That may be so,” said Saint Joseph, breaking in. “But nothing could be more interesting than the adulteress who prostrated herself at my feet today, asking me to cleanse her heart of the leprosy of lust. Only yesterday she had argued with her lover, who vilely insulted her, and she had spent the whole night crying. In the morning, she resolved to leave him, and came here to seek the strength she needed to escape the demon’s grasp.",CO174CL10
11502,23,"She began by praying earnestly, fervently even, but little by little I could tell that her thoughts were drifting back to those earthly delights. Her words gradually lost their vigor. Her prayers became lukewarm, then cold, then mechanical; her lips, accustomed to prayer, continued praying, but her soul, on which I was spying from above, was no longer present; it was with that other man. Finally, she crossed herself, stood up, and left without asking for anything.”",CO174CL10
11503,24,“My story is better than that.”,CO174CL10
11504,25,“Better than mine?” asked Saint Joseph curiously.,CO174CL10
11505,26,"“Much better,” replied Saint Francis de Sales, “and it isn’t sad like the one about that poor soul tormented by base earthly desires, and who may yet be saved by the grace of our Lord. For why would He not save her as well? Anyway, here goes.”",CO174CL10
11506,27,"They all stopped talking and leaned forward attentively, waiting. Here I took fright, remembering how they, who see everything that goes on inside us as clearly as if we were made of glass—all our hidden thoughts, our devious intentions, our secret loathings—could easily have already spied within me some sin, or even the germ of a sin. But I had no time for further reflection; Saint Francis de Sales began to speak.",CO174CL10
11507,28,"“My man is fifty years old,” he said, “his wife is in bed, suffering from a deadly skin infection in her left leg. He’s been beside himself with worry for the last five days, because the disease is getting worse and science has as yet failed to come up with a cure. See, however, how far public prejudice can go. Nobody believes in Sales’s anguish (yes, he bears my name), nobody believes he loves anything but money, for as soon as news of his unhappiness began to spread, the whole neighborhood was awash with scurrilous jokes and jests; there were even those who believed that what was really upsetting him was the thought of how much her funeral would cost.”",CO174CL10
11508,29,"“That could well be true,” said Saint John.",CO174CL10
11509,30,"“But it wasn’t. That he is usurious and miserly I do not deny; as usurious as life itself, and as miserly as death. Never has anyone so resolutely extracted gold, silver, paper, and copper from the pockets of others; never has anyone squirreled away money with more alacrity and zeal. A coin that falls into his hand rarely leaves it again, and anything that isn’t invested in property resides in an iron chest always kept firmly under lock and key.",CO174CL10
11510,31,"Sometimes, in the dead of night, he opens the chest and contemplates his money for a few minutes, then quickly closes it again; but on such nights, he sleeps either badly or not at all. He has no children. He leads a mean and niggardly life, eating little and badly, just enough to keep body and soul together. His family consists of his wife and a black slave woman, one of two he bought many years ago, secretly, from smugglers.",CO174CL10
11511,32,"They say he didn’t even pay for them, because the seller died shortly afterward and there was nothing written down. The other slave woman died a little while ago, and this is where you can decide whether or not this man is a genius when it comes to penny-pinching: he gave the corpse its freedom!”",CO174CL10
11512,33,And the saintly bishop paused to savor the reaction of his fellow saints.,CO174CL10
11513,34,“The corpse?”,CO174CL10
11514,35,"“Yes, the corpse. He had the slave buried as a free pauper, so as not to incur any funeral expenses. Little enough, perhaps, but it was still something. And for him there is no such thing as little: it is with drops of water that whole streets are flooded. He’s not interested in outward appearances or in aping aristocratic tastes; all those things cost money and, as he says, money doesn’t grow on trees. He has no social life to speak of and no family amusements. He listens to and repeats tittle-tattle about other people’s lives, for such pleasures come free.”",CO174CL10
11515,36,"“One can understand people’s skepticism,” said Saint Michael.",CO174CL10
11516,37,"“I wouldn’t disagree there, because the world never looks below the surface of things. The world doesn’t see that, while Sales does indeed think of his wife as his carefully house-trained companion and confidante of twenty years, he really does love her. Don’t be shocked, Michael. Even on the most inhospitable of walls a flower may bloom, colorless and without scent, but a flower nonetheless. The botany of love is full of such anomalies. Sales loves his wife; he’s devastated at the thought of losing her. And so, in the early hours of this morning, not having slept for more than two hours, he began thinking about the impending catastrophe.",CO174CL10
11517,38,"Despairing of the Earth, he turned to God; he thought of us, and especially of me, since he bears my name. Only a miracle could save her, and so he resolved to come here. He lives nearby, and came running. When he entered, his eyes shone with hope; it could have been the light of faith, but, in fact, it was something quite specific, as I will explain. Now, here’s where you all need to pay even closer attention.”",CO174CL10
11518,39,"I saw them lean even farther forward, and I myself could not resist the temptation to take another step closer. The saint’s account was so long and detailed, his analysis so complicated, that I won’t set it down here in full, but merely give the main points.",CO174CL10
11519,40,"“When he thought of coming to ask me to intercede on behalf of his wife, Sales had an idea typical of a usurer: he would promise me a wax leg. It wasn’t the believer seeking a symbolic reminder of a favor granted, but, rather, the usurer trying to force the hand of divine grace with the expectation of profit.",CO174CL10
11520,41,"And it wasn’t only usury that spoke, but avarice too: by offering this vow he was showing that he truly wished to save his wife—a miser’s intuition. Payment is proof: parting with ready cash is the test of whether you truly want something, or so his conscience whispered darkly to him. Well, you all know that such thoughts are not formed as others are; they are born deep within the bowels of character and linger on in the shadows of conscience. But I read all this in his mind the moment he came into the church, looking agitated, his eyes ablaze with hope. I read all these things, and waited for him to finish crossing himself and praying.”",CO174CL10
11521,42,"“At least he has some religious feeling,” muttered Saint Joseph.",CO174CL10
11522,43,"“Some, yes, but only in a very vague and parsimonious way. He never became a member of any confraternities or lay orders, because they do nothing but steal what belongs to the Lord. Or so he says, trying to reconcile devotion with his pocket. But I suppose we can’t have everything; at least he fears God and believes in doctrine.”",CO174CL10
11523,44,“So he knelt and prayed.”,CO174CL10
11524,45,"“Yes, he prayed, and while he was praying, I saw his poor suffering soul, although hope was already beginning to turn to instinctive certainty. God was sure to save the sick woman; He was bound to, thanks to my intervention, and I would intercede. That’s what he was thinking as his lips mouthed the words of the prayer. When he had finished praying, Sales stayed for a short time gazing upward, his hands still clasped together. Finally, he spoke: to confess his pain and to swear that no other hand, beyond that of the Lord Himself, could stay the blow. His wife was dying . . . dying . . . dying . . .",CO174CL10
11525,46,"And he repeated the word, unable to escape it. His wife was dying. He went no further. Ready to formulate his request and give his promise, he could find no appropriate or even vaguely approximate words; he could find nothing at all, so unaccustomed was he to giving anything away. Finally, he spluttered out his request; his wife was dying and he was begging me to save her, to plead with the Lord on her behalf. The promise, however, simply would not come out. As his mouth tried to articulate the first word, avarice tightened its grip about his guts and stopped that promise from escaping his lips. ‘Save her . . . Intercede for her . . .’ he begged.",CO174CL10
11526,47,"“The wax leg appeared to him, hanging in midair before his eyes, followed shortly by the vision of the coin that it would cost him. The leg disappeared, but the coin remained; a disk of purest yellow gold—solid gold, far better than the candlesticks on my altar, which are merely gilt. Whichever way he looked, he could see the coin spinning, spinning, spinning.",CO174CL10
11527,48,"From afar, he caressed it with his eyes, feeling the cold sensation of the metal and even the texture of the raised relief stamped upon it. It was her, his old friend of many years, his companion by day and by night; it was her, hanging in the air before him, spinning giddily, descending from the ceiling, rising from the floor, rolling across the altar from the Epistle to the Gospel, tinkling against the chandelier’s crystal drops.",CO174CL10
11528,49,"“By now the sadness and supplication in his eyes were more intense and entirely genuine. I watched his gaze reach up to me, full of contrition, humiliation, and pain. He mouthed some incoherent platitudes—God . . . the angel of the Lord . . . Christ’s holy wounds . . .—tearful, tremulous words, as if hoping they would convince me of the sincerity of his faith and the immensity of his sorrow. But still no promise of a leg.",CO174CL10
11529,50,"At times, like someone steeling himself before leaping a ditch, his soul dwelled at length upon his wife’s imminent demise and prepared to fling itself into the despair her death would bring him; but when he reached the edge of the ditch and the moment came to leap, he hung back. The coin rose up before him, and the promise stayed buried in his heart.",CO174CL10
11530,51,"“Time was passing. The hallucination grew, because the coin, accelerating and multiplying its leaps and bounds, multiplied itself again and again until there appeared an infinite number of coins; his inner conflict reached tragic proportions. Suddenly the fear that his wife might be at death’s door froze the poor man’s blood and all he could think of was rushing off to be with her. She might be dying! Again he asked me to intercede for her, to save her . . .",CO174CL10
11531,52,"“At this point, the demon of avarice suggested a new transaction—a change of currency, if you will—telling him that the value of prayer was of the highest rank and quality, far superior to that of mere earthly undertakings. And Sales, contrite, head bowed, hands pressed together, his gaze obedient, helpless and resigned, asked me once again to save his wife. And to save her he promised me three hundred—no less—three hundred Our Fathers and three hundred Hail Marys. He repeated this emphatically: three hundred, three hundred, three hundred . . .",CO174CL10
11532,53,"He went higher and higher: five hundred, then a thousand Our Fathers and a thousand Hail Marys. He could see this number written out in front of him, not in words but in numerals, as if this made the figure somehow more vivid and exact, the obligation greater, greater also its seductive power. One thousand Our Fathers, one thousand Hail Marys. And once again those tearful, tremulous words returned: the holy wounds, the angel of the Lord . . . 1,000, 1,000, 1,000.",CO174CL10
11533,54,"The four numerals had grown so tall that they now filled the church from top to bottom, and with them grew both the man’s efforts and his confidence. The word came out loud and clear, ever faster, ever more urgent: ‘thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand!’ Come, now,” said Saint Francis of Sales, “surely you can see the funny side. Go on, laugh! Laugh as much as you like.”",CO174CL10
11534,55,"And the other saints did indeed laugh; not the great guffaws of Homer’s gods when they saw lame Vulcan serving at table, but a polite, pious, very Catholic laugh.",CO174CL10
11535,56,"I heard nothing more after that. I fell to the floor in a dead faint. When I came to, it was broad daylight. I rushed to open the doors and windows of the church and sacristy, to let in the sun, that enemy of bad dreams.",CO174CL10

11537,2,Chapter I,CO049CL10
11538,3,"THAT YOUNG MAN standing over there on the corner of Rua Nova do Conde and Campo da Aclamação at ten o’clock at night is not a thief, he’s not even a philosopher. True, he does have a somewhat mysterious air about him; now and then, he presses one hand to his breast or slaps his thigh or throws down a barely smoked cigar. No, he’s clearly not a philosopher, nor, for that matter, a petty thief, because if someone happens to walk by on the same side of the street, he withdraws into the shadows as if afraid of being recognized.",CO049CL10
11539,4,"Every ten minutes or so, he walks up the street to where it meets Rua do Areal, only to walk back down again ten minutes later, up and down, down and up, and all he achieves is a five percent increase in the angry murmur in his heart.",CO049CL10
11540,5,"Anyone seeing him going back and forth, slapping his thigh, lighting then immediately stubbing out cigars, would assume—quite reasonably, if he had no other explanation—that the man was mad or nearly mad. But no, Ernesto (I’m not authorized to give his whole name) happens to be in love with a young woman who lives on that street; and he is angry because he has not yet received an answer to the letter he sent her this morning.",CO049CL10
11541,6,"We should explain that two days ago, they had a bit of a lover’s tiff, and, breaking his vow never to write to her again, Ernesto had, that very morning, sent her an epistle that filled four incendiary pages, replete with exclamation marks and other punctuational outrages. The letter was dispatched, but no answer came.",CO049CL10
11542,7,"Each time our young lover walked up and down the street, he stopped in front of a two-story house, inside which people could be seen dancing to the sound of a piano. This was where the lady of his thoughts lived, but he paused there in vain, for she did not appear at the window, and no letter reached his hands.",CO049CL10
11543,8,Ernesto bit his lip so as not to utter a cry of despair and went off to the next corner to vent his fury.,CO049CL10
11544,9,"“What possible explanation can there be?” he said to himself. “Why does she not throw me a note from the window? No, she’s obviously too busy dancing, possibly with her new inamorato, and she’s completely forgotten that I’m out here in the street when I could be inside . . .”",CO049CL10
11545,10,"At this point, he fell silent, and instead of the gesture of despair he should have made, he merely let out a long, sorrowful sigh. The explanation for this sigh, so unlikely in a man seething with rage, is almost too delicate a matter to be set down in writing, but, on the principle that one should either say nothing at all or reveal everything, here goes.",CO049CL10
11546,11,"Ernesto was standing outside the house of Senhor Vieira, Rosina’s uncle, Rosina being the name of Ernesto’s beloved. He was a frequent visitor to the house, and it was there that he had quarreled with her two days before this particular Saturday in October 1850, when the events I’m describing took place. Now, why is Ernesto not one of those gentlemen dancing and drinking tea? The previous afternoon, Senhor Vieira had chanced to meet Ernesto in the street and told him that, the following day, they would be holding a small party to celebrate some family occasion, I can’t quite remember which.",CO049CL10
11547,12,"“It was a spur-of-the-moment decision,” he said, “and I’ve only invited a few people, but I’m hoping that it will, nonetheless, be a brilliant affair. In fact, I was about to send you a formal invitation, but you hardly need one, do you?”",CO049CL10
11548,13,"“No, of course not,” Ernesto answered, rubbing his hands contentedly.",CO049CL10
11549,14,“Be sure to come!”,CO049CL10
11550,15,"“I will, sir!”",CO049CL10
11551,16,"“Oh, there’s just one thing,” said Vieira as he was turning to go. “The subdelegate will be coming, too, as well as the comendador, and I’d like all my guests to wear tails. You can put up with that for one evening, can’t you?”",CO049CL10
11552,17,"“With pleasure,” said Ernesto, turning as pale as a ghost.",CO049CL10
11553,18,"Why so pale? However ridiculous and pitiable it may seem, dear reader, I have to inform you that our Ernesto did not own a tailcoat, either old or new. Vieira’s request was absurd, but there was no getting out of it; he could either go to the party in a tailcoat or not go at all. Whatever it took, he had to find a solution to this gravest of problems. Three possible solutions occurred to the poor, troubled lad: order a new tailcoat for the following night, regardless of the cost; buy one on credit; borrow one from a friend.",CO049CL10
11554,19,"He dismissed the first two possibilities as impracticable; Ernesto had no money nor that much credit. There remained only the third idea. Ernesto drew up a list of friends and probable tailcoats, put it in his pocket, and set off in search of the golden fleece.",CO049CL10
11555,20,"Luck, however, was not on his side: the first friend had to go to a wedding the next day and the second to a ball; the tailcoat of the third was torn, the fourth had lent his to someone else, the fifth never lent his to anyone, and the sixth had no tailcoat at all. He asked two more friends, but one had left the day before for Iguaçu, and the other was stationed at the Fortress of São João as second lieutenant in the national guard.",CO049CL10
11556,21,"You can imagine Ernesto’s despair, but observe, too, how cruelly fate was treating the poor fellow, for, on the way home, he encountered no fewer than three funerals, two of which involved a lot of carriages, all of whose occupants were wearing tailcoats. He had no alternative but to bow his head to fate, and accept the situation. Since, however, he had determined to be reconciled with Rosina, he wrote her the letter I mentioned earlier and sent the houseboy to deliver it and to tell her that he would be waiting that night on the corner of Campo da Aclamação to receive her answer.",CO049CL10
11557,22,"As we know, no answer came. Ernesto could not understand the reason for her silence; there had been many other tiffs before, but none had withstood the first letter he sent, or lasted more than forty-eight hours. Convinced that no reply would come that night, Ernesto returned home with despair in his heart. He lived on Rua da Misericórdia. By the time he arrived, he was weary and downcast. And yet it still took him an age to get to sleep.",CO049CL10
11558,23,"He undressed so hurriedly that he almost tore his vest when the back buckle got caught on a trouser button. He hurled his boots at the dresser and almost broke a vase. He thumped the table seven or eight times, smoked two cigars, railed against fate, against Rosina and against himself, and, finally, as dawn was breaking, managed to fall asleep.",CO049CL10
11559,24,"While he is sleeping, let us find out what lies behind his beloved’s silence.",CO049CL10
11560,25,Chapter II,CO049CL10
11561,26,"You see that girl over there, sitting on a sofa between two other young ladies, talking to them in a low voice, and occasionally batting her eyelids. That is Rosina. Rosina’s eyes deceive no one except her suitors. Her eyes are bright and ensnaring, and she has a particular way of deploying those eyes that makes them even brighter and more ensnaring.",CO049CL10
11562,27,"She is elegant and graceful; if she were not, our poor unhappy Ernesto would not be so taken with her, for he has excellent taste. She isn’t tall, but petite, lively, and mischievous. Her manners and her way of speaking are somewhat bold and affected, but, when a friend pointed this out to him, Ernesto declared that he didn’t like shrinking violets.",CO049CL10
11563,28,"“Well, I’ve never liked violets myself, shrinking or not,” retorted his friend, delighted to be able to make this little joke.",CO049CL10
11564,29,A very 1850s joke.,CO049CL10
11565,30,"She does not wear expensive clothes because her uncle is not rich, but she still manages to be extremely smart and elegant. Her head is adorned very simply, with two blue ribbons.",CO049CL10
11566,31,"“Ah, if only those two ribbons wanted to tie the knot with me!” said one dandy sporting a black mustache and a middle parting.",CO049CL10
11567,32,“If only those ribbons wanted to carry me up to heaven!” said another dandy with brown side-whiskers and tiny ears.,CO049CL10
11568,33,"Ambitious desires on the part of both lads—ambitious and futile, because, if anyone has caught her attention, it is a young man with a fair mustache and a long nose who is currently talking to the subdelegate. He is the person at whom Rosina occasionally glances, furtively it’s true, but not so furtively as to escape the notice of the two girls beside her.",CO049CL10
11569,34,"“She’s really got her teeth into him!” one said to the other, indicating with a nod of her head the young man with the long nose.",CO049CL10
11570,35,"“Oh, really, Justina!”",CO049CL10
11571,36,“Pure tittle-tattle!” said the other girl.,CO049CL10
11572,37,"“Oh, do be quiet, Amélia!”",CO049CL10
11573,38,"“Are you trying to pull the wool over our eyes?” said Justina. “Well, don’t. He’s looking over here again. He’s not even listening to the subdelegate, who, poor man, is far too fat to play the part of chaperone.”",CO049CL10
11574,39,"“If you don’t shut up, I’m leaving,” said Rosina, pretending to be annoyed.",CO049CL10
11575,40,"“Well, leave, then!”",CO049CL10
11576,41,“Poor Ernesto!” sighed Amélia.,CO049CL10
11577,42,"“Sshh, Auntie might hear you,” said Rosina, shooting a sideways look at a plump, elderly lady seated right next to the sofa and currently regaling a friend with a detailed account of her husband’s latest malady.",CO049CL10
11578,43,“Why didn’t Ernesto come this evening?” asked Justina.,CO049CL10
11579,44,“He sent a message to Papa saying he had some urgent work to do.”,CO049CL10
11580,45,"“Perhaps he’s found someone else too,” said Justina in an insinuating voice.",CO049CL10
11581,46,“He wouldn’t dare!” cried Rosina.,CO049CL10
11582,47,“Such confidence!”,CO049CL10
11583,48,“Such love!”,CO049CL10
11584,49,“Such certainty!”,CO049CL10
11585,50,“Such faith!”,CO049CL10
11586,51,"“He wouldn’t dare,” repeated Rosina. “Ernesto wouldn’t dare fall in love with another girl, I’m sure of that. Ernesto is a . . .” She did not finish her sentence.",CO049CL10
11587,52,“A what?” asked Amélia.,CO049CL10
11588,53,“A what?” asked Justina.,CO049CL10
11589,54,"At that moment, a waltz struck up, and the young man with the long nose, whom the subdelegate had now abandoned in order to go and speak to Vieira, came over to the sofa and asked Rosina if he could have the honor of that dance. She modestly lowered her eyes, murmured a few inaudible words, then got to her feet and joined the other dancers.",CO049CL10
11590,55,"Justina and Amélia moved closer to each other so as to pass comment on Rosina’s behavior and the rather graceless way in which she waltzed. However, since they were both friends of Rosina’s, these criticisms were not made with any desire to offend, but in the gentle way in which friends always criticize absent friends.",CO049CL10
11591,56,"Not that they were right, for Rosina waltzed very well and could stand comparison with any other exponent of that dance. As for her being hopelessly in love, they could have been right, indeed they were; the way in which she looked at and spoke to the young man with the long nose would have aroused suspicions in the most innocent of minds.",CO049CL10
11592,57,"When the waltz was over, they strolled about a little, before going over to stand near a window. By then, it was one o’clock, and poor Ernesto was already trudging back to Rua da Misericórdia.",CO049CL10
11593,58,"“I’ll come tomorrow at six o’clock,” said the other young man.",CO049CL10
11594,59,"“No, not six o’clock!” said Rosina.",CO049CL10
11595,60,That was the time Ernesto usually called.,CO049CL10
11596,61,"“At five, then.”",CO049CL10
11597,62,"“At five?” she said. “Yes, at five,”",CO049CL10
11598,63,"The young man with the long nose thanked her with a smile that was a ratification of his amorous treaty, and he proffered a few more words to which she listened tenderly and blushingly, half proud, half modest. What he said was this: that Rosina was the flower of the ball, but also the flower of Rua do Conde, and not just the flower of Rua do Conde, but the flower of the whole city.",CO049CL10
11599,64,"Ernesto had often said exactly the same, but the young man with the long nose had a particular way of complimenting a young woman. There was, for example, the elegant and quite inimitable way in which he stuck his left thumb in the left armhole of his vest, then wiggled the other fingers about as if he were playing the piano; and no one, at least no one in the immediate vicinity, had quite such an elegant way of holding out his arm, smoothing his hair, or simply offering a cup of tea.",CO049CL10
11600,65,"Such were the qualities that conquered the lovely Rosina’s fickle heart. Was that all? No. The mere fact that Ernesto lacked the alluring tailcoat that adorned the body and enhanced the charms of his more fortunate rival might give a clue to the more alert reader. Rosina was probably unaware of Ernesto’s difficulties in finding a tailcoat, but she did know that he occupied a rather lowly position at the arsenal, whereas the young man with the long nose had a rather better position in a commercial establishment.",CO049CL10
11601,66,"Any girl claiming to have philosophical ideas about love and marriage would say that the impulses of the heart came first. Rosina was not entirely immune to the impulses of the heart or to the philosophy of love, but she had ambitions to be somebody, she longed for new dresses and frequent visits to the theater, she wanted, in short, to be seen. In time, the young man with the long nose would be able to give her all these things, for she could already see him being made a director of the company he worked for; Ernesto, on the other hand, would find it hard to gain promotion at the arsenal, and he would certainly not rise quickly or very far.",CO049CL10
11602,67,"When placed on the scales, poor Ernesto was inevitably the lighter weight.",CO049CL10
11603,68,"Rosina had known the new candidate for a few weeks, but this was the first time she had been able to speak to him properly, to consolidate, if we can put it like that, their situation. Their relationship, which, up until then, had been purely telegraphic, became verbal; and if the reader has a taste for a more mannered, Gongoristic style, I would say that so many were the telegrams exchanged between them that night, that neighboring states, fearful of losing a possible alliance, sent out a call to the militia of sweet smiles, ordered a whole flotilla of fluttering eyelashes, prepared an artillery of tender glances, fond smiles, and handkerchiefs pressed modestly to lips; but this whole barrage of bucklers had no effect whatsoever because the lovely Rosina, at least that night, was absorbed by one thought only.",CO049CL10
11604,69,"When the ball ended and Rosina went to her room, she saw a folded piece of paper on her dressing table.",CO049CL10
11605,70,“What’s that?” she thought.,CO049CL10
11606,71,"She opened it. It was the response to Ernesto’s letter that she had forgotten to send. What if someone else had read it? No, they couldn’t have. She carefully folded it up again, sealed it, and put it in a drawer, saying to herself:",CO049CL10
11607,72,“I must send it tomorrow morning.”,CO049CL10
11608,73,Chapter III,CO049CL10
11609,74,"“Fool.” That is the word Rosina was going to use when she defended Ernesto’s fidelity, so mischievously mocked by her two friends.",CO049CL10
11610,75,"It was barely three months since Ernesto had begun courting Rosina and exchanging letters, and since they had been declaring eternal love to each other, and, in that short space of time, he had already suspected he might have a few rivals. Whenever this occurred, he would seethe with rage and consider abandoning the whole business. However, with a wave of her magic wand, she always led him back to the straight and narrow, by writing him a sharp note or whispering a few fiery words to him. Ernesto would admit that he had misunderstood, and that she really was far too kind.",CO049CL10
11611,76,"“You’re very fortunate that I do still love you,” Rosina would say, feigning annoyance.",CO049CL10
11612,77,“I know!”,CO049CL10
11613,78,“Why must you invent such stories?”,CO049CL10
11614,79,“I wasn’t inventing . . . someone told me.”,CO049CL10
11615,80,"“Well, you shouldn’t have believed them.”",CO049CL10
11616,81,"“No, you’re right, I shouldn’t—and you’re an angel sent from heaven!”",CO049CL10
11617,82,"Rosina would forgive him his latest accusation, and things would carry on as before.",CO049CL10
11618,83,"His friend and housemate, Jorge, to whom Ernesto confided all his joys and woes and to whom he turned for counsel, often used to tell him:",CO049CL10
11619,84,"“Look, Ernesto, I think it’s just wasted effort on your part.”",CO049CL10
11620,85,“Why?”,CO049CL10
11621,86,“Because she doesn’t love you.”,CO049CL10
11622,87,“Impossible!”,CO049CL10
11623,88,“You’re simply a way of passing the time.”,CO049CL10
11624,89,“That’s where you’re wrong. She does love me.”,CO049CL10
11625,90,"“Yes, but she loves a lot of other men too.”",CO049CL10
11626,91,“Jorge!”,CO049CL10
11627,92,“In short . . .”,CO049CL10
11628,93,“Not another word!”,CO049CL10
11629,94,"“. . . she’s a flirt,” concluded his friend quietly.",CO049CL10
11630,95,"On hearing his friend’s peremptory judgment, Ernesto shot him a long, deep look, capable of stopping all known mechanical movement; however, when his friend’s face showed not a trace of fear or repentance, Ernesto withdrew the look and everything ended peacefully. In this, he was more prudent than a certain senator, Dom Manuel, who, when asked by the Viscount of Jequitinhonha to withdraw his laughter during a debate, continued to laugh anyway.",CO049CL10
11631,96,"Such was Ernesto’s confidence in the flower of Rua do Conde. If she had announced to him that she had in her pocket one of the towers from the Candelária Church, Ernesto might, indeed probably would, have accepted this as true.",CO049CL10
11632,97,"This time, though, the quarrel was a serious one. Ernesto had actually seen her surreptitiously receive a note from some kind of cousin who occasionally visited the house. His eyes flashed angrily when he saw the mysterious epistle gleaming white in her hand. He eyed the young man threateningly, gave Rosina a scornful look, and left. Then he wrote the letter we already know about, and waited in the street for her reply. What reply was he expecting since he had actually seen Rosina take the note?",CO049CL10
11633,98,"Dear ingenuous reader, he wanted a reply that would prove to him that he had seen nothing, a reply that would make him regard himself with scorn and disgust. He could not really see how such a response was possible, but, deep in his heart, that is what he wanted.",CO049CL10
11634,99,The reply came the following morning. His housemate woke him at eight to give him the letter from Rosina.,CO049CL10
11635,100,"Ernesto sat bolt upright in bed, then, when he had calmed down, opened the letter and devoured its contents. The look of celestial good fortune on his face revealed the contents of the letter to his friend Jorge.",CO049CL10
11636,101,"“It’s all sorted out,” said Ernesto, folding up the letter and getting out of bed. “She’s explained everything, and I clearly misunderstood.”",CO049CL10
11637,102,"“I see,” said Jorge, looking pityingly at his friend. “So what does she say?”",CO049CL10
11638,103,"Ernesto did not reply at once; he unfolded the letter again, read it to himself, refolded it, looked up at the ceiling, then down at his slippers, then at his friend, and only after making this whole series of gestures intended to indicate the depth of his abstraction, only then did he reply:",CO049CL10
11639,104,"“It turns out that what I took to be a love letter was a note from her cousin asking to borrow some money from Rosina’s uncle. She says I’m most unkind to force her to speak of these family peccadilloes and concludes by saying that she loves me more than she could ever love anyone. Here, read it.”",CO049CL10
11640,105,"Jorge took the letter and read it, while Ernesto paced back and forth, gesticulating and muttering monosyllabically to himself, as if mentally composing an act of contrition.",CO049CL10
11641,106,“So what do you think?” he asked when Jorge returned the letter.,CO049CL10
11642,107,"“You’re right. She does explain everything,” answered Jorge.",CO049CL10
11643,108,"Ernesto went to Rua do Conde that same evening. She received him with a smile as soon as she saw him enter the room. At the first opportunity, they made their peace, with Ernesto declaring that he was consumed with regret for ever having suspected her, and with Rosina—in the safety of the darkened room, and before the maid came in to light the candles on the dresser—generously allowing him to steal a kiss.",CO049CL10
11644,109,"Now is the reader’s chance to question me about the intentions of this young woman, who, while she preferred the employment prospects of the young man with the long nose, was still corresponding with Ernesto and giving him every indication that she preferred him, even though she didn’t.",CO049CL10
11645,110,"Rosina’s intentions, inquisitive reader, were entirely marital. She wanted to marry and to marry as well as she could. To that end, she allowed herself to be courted by all her suitors, choosing which one best chimed with her desires, but without discouraging the others, because the best of the suitors might fall away, and if there was one thing worse than marrying badly, it was not marrying at all.",CO049CL10
11646,111,"This, at least, was her plan. We should also add that she was an inveterate flirt, who enjoyed having at her feet a whole horde of suitors, many of whom did not intend to marry her at all and for whom courtship was a mere pastime, revealing in these gentlemen an utter vacancy of mind.",CO049CL10
11647,112,"Half a loaf is better than none, as the saying goes. Morally and maritally speaking, Ernesto was Rosina’s possible half a loaf, a kind of pis aller, as the French say, useful to have to hand.",CO049CL10
11648,113,Chapter IV,CO049CL10
11649,114,"The young man with the long nose was not one of those birds of passage; his intentions were strictly conjugal. He was twenty-six, hardworking, popular, frugal, simple, and sincere, a true son of Minas Gerais. He could certainly make any young woman happy.",CO049CL10
11650,115,"For her part, Rosina so insinuated herself into his thoughts that she almost caused him to lose his job. One day, when his boss came over to the desk where he was working, he noticed underneath the bookkeeper’s inkstand a piece of paper on which the word “love” was written two or three times. One mention of that word was quite enough to send the young man’s spirits soaring. Senhor Gomes Arruda frowned, focused his thoughts, then improvised a long and menacing speech in which the poor bookkeeper understood only the expression “out on your ear.”",CO049CL10
11651,116,"“Out on your ear” is a very weighty expression, which the bookkeeper pondered long and hard, and, forced to acknowledge that his boss was right, he set about mending his ways, although not his love. Love was taking ever deeper root in him; this was his first serious love, and, of course, he had fallen for a past-mistress in the field.",CO049CL10
11652,117,"“Things can’t go on like this,” he was thinking as he walked home one night, scratching his chin. “I should really marry her as soon as possible. With what I get from my family and what I earn at the office, I reckon I can just about manage, and the rest is up to God.”",CO049CL10
11653,118,"Ernesto soon came to suspect the intentions of the young man with the long nose. Once, when he caught Rosina and his rival exchanging a glance, he got angry, and took the first opportunity to interrogate his beloved about this equivocal situation.",CO049CL10
11654,119,"“Come on, own up!” he said.",CO049CL10
11655,120,"“Oh, good heavens!” she exclaimed. “You’re so suspicious. Yes, I did look at him, but only because of you.”",CO049CL10
11656,121,“Because of me?” asked Ernesto in an icily ironic tone of voice.,CO049CL10
11657,122,"“Yes, I was admiring his very smart cravat and thinking that I could buy something similar for you at New Year. Now that you’ve forced me to reveal my secret, though, I’ll have to think of some other little present.”",CO049CL10
11658,123,"Ernesto saw that she was right. He recalled that there really had been a munificent gleam in her eye, if you’ll forgive such an old-fashioned adjective; his anger dissolved into a fond, contrite smile, and the quarrel went no further.",CO049CL10
11659,124,"Days later, on a Sunday, when he and she were in the parlor, and one of her uncle’s children was standing at the window, the two lovers were interrupted by the boy running over to them, shouting:",CO049CL10
11660,125,"“He’s coming, he’s coming!”",CO049CL10
11661,126,"“Who?” asked Ernesto, feeling his heart splinter.",CO049CL10
11662,127,"Going to the window, he saw it was his rival.",CO049CL10
11663,128,"Fortunately, Rosina’s aunt entered at this point, for a storm was already brewing over Ernesto’s blazing forehead.",CO049CL10
11664,129,"Shortly afterward, the young man with the long nose arrived and, on seeing Ernesto, he seemed to smirk. Ernesto withdrew into a sulk. Had his eyes been knives they would have committed two murders there and then. He managed to contain himself, though, in order to observe the couple more closely. Rosina did not appear to pay particular attention to the other man; she was merely polite. This slightly calmed Ernesto’s troubled spirit, and, after an hour, he was restored to his usual state of perfect happiness.",CO049CL10
11665,130,"He did not, however, notice the suspicious glances occasionally directed at him by the young man with the long nose. The mischievous smile had vanished from the bookkeeper’s lips, suspicion having slipped into his mind when he noticed the almost indifferent manner in which Rosina treated both him and her other suitor.",CO049CL10
11666,131,“Could he be a serious rival?” he wondered.,CO049CL10
11667,132,"The next day, as soon as he had the chance to speak to her alone, with no witnesses, he revealed the suspicions that had cast a dark cloud over a mind that had hitherto been innocently sunny. Rosina merely laughed, so persuasively that the young man with the long nose thought it undignified to repeat such an absurd suspicion.",CO049CL10
11668,133,"“Oh, he would like me to love him, but he’s wasting his time. I have only one face and one heart!”",CO049CL10
11669,134,"“Ah, Rosina, you’re an angel.”",CO049CL10
11670,135,"“Come, now!”",CO049CL10
11671,136,"“Yes, an angel,” he insisted. “And I believe it will not be long before I can call you my wife.”",CO049CL10
11672,137,Rosina’s eyes sparkled with contentment.,CO049CL10
11673,138,"“Yes,” he went on, “in two months’ time we’ll be married.”",CO049CL10
11674,139,“Oh!”,CO049CL10
11675,140,"“If, that is . . .”",CO049CL10
11676,141,Rosina turned pale.,CO049CL10
11677,142,“If?” she repeated.,CO049CL10
11678,143,“If Senhor Vieira gives his consent . . .”,CO049CL10
11679,144,"“Why wouldn’t he?” she said, quickly recovering from this sudden shock. “He wants only my happiness, and to marry you would be my greatest happiness. Even were he opposed to my heart’s desire, I would only have to stand my ground for our wish to be granted. But, don’t worry, my uncle will put no obstacles in our way.”",CO049CL10
11680,145,The young man with the long nose stood for a few minutes gazing wordlessly at Rosina; two things astonished him: Rosina’s strength of mind and her love for him. She was the first to break that silence.,CO049CL10
11681,146,"“So in two months’ time, then?”",CO049CL10
11682,147,“If luck is on my side.”,CO049CL10
11683,148,“Is there any reason it won’t be?”,CO049CL10
11684,149,"“Who knows?” he said, with a hesitant sigh.",CO049CL10
11685,150,"In the light of this happy prospect, the scale in which poor Ernesto’s hopes were resting began to grow still lighter. Rosina’s letters became less frequent, and in the few he did receive, her passion was less intense, the phrasing stiffer, colder, more stilted. When they were together, there was no longer the same easy expansiveness; his presence seemed to embarrass her. Ernesto seriously began to think the battle was lost.",CO049CL10
11686,151,"Unfortunately, his tactic was to ask if his suspicions had any foundation, and she responded earnestly that they did not, and this was enough to restore his peace of mind. This peace was short-lived and his serenity only skin-deep. Rosina’s letters continued to be brief and her manners cold, and that, together with the other man’s continued presence, cast a pall over Ernesto’s thoughts. And yet, while one moment he was plunged into the slough of despond, the next he was lifted up into celestial bliss, thus demonstrating what nature wanted him to be: a fickle, passive soul, carried like a leaf wherever the wind chose to take him.",CO049CL10
11687,152,"Nevertheless, the truth was hard to avoid. One day, he noticed that as well as Rosina’s suspiciously affectionate ways, her uncle also seemed to be treating his rival more favorably. He was right; although the new suitor had still not formally asked for Rosina’s hand in marriage, it was clear to Senhor Vieira that he would soon have a new nephew, and since this suitor was in the world of commerce, she could not, in his opinion, have made a happier choice.",CO049CL10
11688,153,"I will say nothing of Ernesto’s despair and terror, of the curses he uttered on the day when the certainty of his defeat finally hit home. Rosina’s denials were no longer enough, and, besides, they seemed to him lukewarm, which indeed they were. The poor fellow even began to think that she and his rival had joined forces to mock him.",CO049CL10
11689,154,"Since, as a general rule, it is part of our wretched human condition for pride to come before mere love, the moment he felt his suspicions were well founded, he was filled with a sense of fierce indignation, and I doubt that the final act of any melodrama could possibly contain as much spilled blood as the blood he shed in his imagination.",CO049CL10
11690,155,"Only in his imagination, kind reader, not just because he was incapable of harming another human being, but because any kind of resolution was repugnant to his nature. For that reason, after pondering the matter long and hard, he confided all his anxieties and suspicions to his housemate and asked for his advice: Jorge gave him two pieces of advice.",CO049CL10
11691,156,"“In my opinion,” Jorge said, “you should forget about her and concentrate on your work, which is far more important.”",CO049CL10
11692,157,“Certainly not!”,CO049CL10
11693,158,"“What, give up work?”",CO049CL10
11694,159,"“No, I mean that I cannot possibly give her up!”",CO049CL10
11695,160,"“Well, in that case,” said Jorge, removing his left boot, “go and talk to the man you think is your rival and find out the truth.”",CO049CL10
11696,161,"“I will!” cried Ernesto. “That’s an excellent idea, but,” he went on after a moment’s thought, “what if he isn’t my rival, then what should I do? How will I find out if there’s some other rival?”",CO049CL10
11697,162,"“In that case,” said Jorge, reclining philosophically on a chaise longue, “in that case, my advice would be to hell with both of them.”",CO049CL10
11698,163,"Ernesto closed his ears to such blasphemy, got dressed, and left.",CO049CL10
11699,164,Chapter V,CO049CL10
11700,165,"Ernesto immediately headed for the place where the young man with the long nose worked, determined now to have it out with him once and for all. Well, he did hesitate a little and was almost on the point of turning back, but so violent were his feelings that they won out over any weakness of will, and, twenty minutes later, he reached his destination. He did not go into the actual building, but paced up and down outside, waiting for the other man to come out, which he did only forty-five minutes later; forty-five exasperatingly slow minutes.",CO049CL10
11701,166,"Ernesto walked nonchalantly over to his rival, greeted him with a timid, fearful smile, then they stood for a few seconds looking at each other. The rival was just about to doff his hat and take his leave, when Ernesto asked:",CO049CL10
11702,167,“Are you going to Rua do Conde today?”,CO049CL10
11703,168,“Possibly.”,CO049CL10
11704,169,“At what time?”,CO049CL10
11705,170,“I don’t know yet. Why do you ask?”,CO049CL10
11706,171,“We could go together. I’m going at eight.”,CO049CL10
11707,172,The young man with the long nose did not respond.,CO049CL10
11708,173,“Where are you off to now?” asked Ernesto after a silence.,CO049CL10
11709,174,"“To the Passeio Público, unless, that is, you are too,” his rival retorted.",CO049CL10
11710,175,Ernesto turned pale.,CO049CL10
11711,176,“Are you trying to avoid me?”,CO049CL10
11712,177,“I certainly am.”,CO049CL10
11713,178,"“Well, I won’t let you. There’s something I need to discuss with you. Wait, don’t turn your back on me. I can be bold, too, though less with my tongue than with my actions. Give me your arm, and we’ll go to the Passeio Público together.”",CO049CL10
11714,179,"The young man with the long nose was tempted to take his rival on, but they were standing immediately outside his place of work, and if he were seen fighting that would be the end of his career in commerce. He therefore preferred to continue walking, and had already set off when Ernesto shouted after him:",CO049CL10
11715,180,"“Come back here, you hapless lover!”",CO049CL10
11716,181,The young man spun around:,CO049CL10
11717,182,“What did you call me?”,CO049CL10
11718,183,"“I called you a ‘hapless lover,’ ” said Ernesto, scrutinizing his rival’s face for some clue as to his true feelings.",CO049CL10
11719,184,"“How odd,” said the young man with the long nose, “how odd that you should call me a ‘hapless lover’ when everyone has seen what a pathetic figure you’ve cut in your attempts to win the love of a young woman who is mine . . .”",CO049CL10
11720,185,“Yours!”,CO049CL10
11721,186,"“Yes, mine!”",CO049CL10
11722,187,"“I would say, rather, ours . . .”",CO049CL10
11723,188,“How dare you!”,CO049CL10
11724,189,"The young man with the long nose clenched a fist in readiness; however, the calm confidence with which Ernesto was looking at him changed his mind. Was he telling the truth? Had that young woman—who had sworn eternal love to him and whom he was planning to marry, but about whom he, too, had once had his suspicions—had she actually given that man the right to call her his? This simple question so troubled him that he stood for nearly two minutes staring dumbly at Ernesto, who stared dumbly back at him.",CO049CL10
11725,190,"“That is a very grave allegation,” he said at last. “I demand an explanation.”",CO049CL10
11726,191,"“As do I,” answered Ernesto.",CO049CL10
11727,192,“Let’s go to the Passeio Público.”,CO049CL10
11728,193,"They walked on, initially in silence, not just because of the awkwardness of the situation, but also because each feared hearing some cruel revelation. Conversation began with brief, monosyllabic sentences, only gradually becoming more natural and more fluent. Everything that you, dear reader, already know about the two men was laid out by both of them and heard by both with a mixture of sadness and anger.",CO049CL10
11729,194,"“If what you say is true,” remarked the other man as they walked down Rua das Marrecas, “then I can only conclude that we have been deceived.”",CO049CL10
11730,195,"“Vilely deceived,” added Ernesto.",CO049CL10
11731,196,"“For my part,” said the former, “this is a terrible blow, because I really loved her and was hoping soon to make her my wife. Luckily for me, you have warned me off in time . . .”",CO049CL10
11732,197,"“Others might criticize me for doing what I did, but the end justifies the means. I am suffering, too, of course, for I, too, was madly in love with her!”",CO049CL10
11733,198,"These words were spoken with such deep emotion that they reverberated in his rival’s heart, and the two men remained for a while saying nothing, mulling over their respective feelings of pain and humiliation. Ernesto broke the silence with an agonized sigh just as they reached the Passeio Público. Only the guard at the gate heard that sigh, for the young man with the long nose was pondering a question.",CO049CL10
11734,199,"“Should I condemn her so easily?” he wondered. “And is this man merely a disappointed suitor who is using this ploy to neutralize me, his rival?”",CO049CL10
11735,200,"Ernesto’s face seemed to give the lie to this conjecture; however, since this was too serious a matter to judge by appearances, he reopened the chapter of their shared revelations, and the incidents and gestures recalled by one sparked an echo in the other.",CO049CL10
11736,201,<NOT INCLUDED>,CO049CL10
11737,202,"What decided them, though, was the moment when they each produced a letter they happened to have with them. The text of both letters proved that they were recent; the expressions of love were not the same, because, as we know, Rosina was deliberately tempering the language she used in her notes to Ernesto, but this was quite enough to deliver the coup de grâce to the young man with the long nose.",CO049CL10
11738,203,"“We must spurn her,” he said when he finished reading his rival’s letter.",CO049CL10
11739,204,“Is that all?” asked Ernesto. “Is that enough?”,CO049CL10
11740,205,"“What would be the point of taking our revenge?” objected the young man with the long nose. “Even if we did take our revenge, would that be worthy of us?”",CO049CL10
11741,206,"He stopped speaking, then an idea occurred to him, and he exclaimed:",CO049CL10
11742,207,“I’ve just thought of a way.”,CO049CL10
11743,208,“What?”,CO049CL10
11744,209,"“Why don’t we each send her a letter breaking off all relations, but our letters will be identical?”",CO049CL10
11745,210,"Ernesto instantly approved of this idea, for he seemed even more humiliated than his rival, and they both went home to write their fateful letters.",CO049CL10
11746,211,"The following day, immediately after breakfast, Rosina was sitting quietly at home, blissfully unaware of the impending disaster, and even forging plans for the future, all of which hinged upon the young man with the long nose, when the houseboy came in, carrying two letters.",CO049CL10
11747,212,"“Miss Rosina,” he said. “This letter is from Senhor Ernesto, and this one—”",CO049CL10
11748,213,"“What,” she said, “are they both . . . ?”",CO049CL10
11749,214,"“No,” explained the houseboy, “one was waiting on the corner up there and the other on the corner down below.”",CO049CL10
11750,215,"And, hand in pocket, jingling the coins the two rivals had given him, he left her to read the two missives at her leisure. The first one she opened was from Ernesto. It read as follows:",CO049CL10
11751,216,"Senhora! Now that I am certain of your treachery, a certainty that nothing will now eradicate from my mind, I am taking the liberty of telling you that you are free and I am restored to health. Enough of humiliations! I could believe in you for as long as you had the ability to deceive me, now, though, I bid you farewell forever!",CO049CL10
11752,217,"Rosina shrugged when she read this letter, then rapidly tore open the letter from the young man with the long nose and read: Senhora! Now that I am certain of your treachery, a certainty that nothing will now . . . Her surprise grew and grew. Both men were bidding her farewell and both letters were couched in the same words. So they must have found out everything from each other. There was no way to repair the situation; all was lost!",CO049CL10
11753,218,"Rosina did not usually cry. She sometimes rubbed her eyes to make them red when she needed to show a suitor she was upset about something. This time, though, she shed real tears, not of hurt, but of rage. Both rivals had triumphed and both were leaving her, having conspired together to deliver the final blow. There was nothing to be done; despair entered her soul.",CO049CL10
11754,219,"Alas, there was not a single sail on the horizon. The cousin we mentioned in a previous chapter had designs upon another young woman, and those designs were marital in nature. For the last month, she herself had been neglecting her usual system, leaving a number of interrogative glances unanswered. She had been abandoned by God and by men.",CO049CL10
11755,220,"No, she still had something up her sleeve.",CO049CL10
11756,221,Chapter VI,CO049CL10
11757,222,"A month after this disaster, Ernesto was at home, chatting with his housemate and two other friends, one of whom was the young man with the long nose. He heard someone call him and, going over to the stairs, he saw that it was the houseboy from Rua Nova do Conde.",CO049CL10
11758,223,"“What do you want?” he asked sternly, suspecting that the houseboy might have come to ask him for money.",CO049CL10
11759,224,"“I’ve brought you this,” said the houseboy softly.",CO049CL10
11760,225,"And he took from his pocket a letter, which he handed to Ernesto.",CO049CL10
11761,226,"Ernesto’s initial impulse was to reject the letter and kick the houseboy down the stairs, but, as he later confessed, his heart whispered something to him. He reached out his hand, took the letter, opened it and read.",CO049CL10
11762,227,<NOT INCLUDED>,CO049CL10
11763,228,Once again I bow to your unjust assertions. I am weary of crying. I can no longer live beneath such a calumny. Come now or I will die!,CO049CL10
11764,229,"Ernesto rubbed his eyes; he could not believe what he had just read. Was it another trap or was she telling the truth? It could be a trap, but when Ernesto looked more closely, it seemed to him that he could see a stain left by a teardrop. She had definitely wept, and if she had wept, it was because she was suffering, and in that case . . .",CO049CL10
11765,230,"Ernesto spent about eight or ten minutes pondering these thoughts. He did not know what to do. Answering Rosina’s call would mean forgetting her treacherous love for another man in whose hands he had even seen a letter signed by her. And yet not going to see her might contribute to the death of a creature who, even if he had never loved her, deserved to be treated humanely.",CO049CL10
11766,231,"“Tell her I’ll come soon,” Ernesto told the houseboy.",CO049CL10
11767,232,"When he went back into the room, he looked quite different. His friends inevitably noticed the change and tried to find out what had happened.",CO049CL10
11768,233,"“It must have been a creditor,” said one.",CO049CL10
11769,234,"“He hasn’t been paid,” said another.",CO049CL10
11770,235,"“A new lover,” suggested his housemate.",CO049CL10
11771,236,"“It might be all those things,” answered Ernesto in a voice intended to be cheerful.",CO049CL10
11772,237,"That afternoon, Ernesto got dressed and went to Rua Nova do Conde. He stopped several times, determined to go no farther, but a moment’s thought was enough to drive away all scruples, and so he continued on.",CO049CL10
11773,238,"“There’s some mystery here,” he told himself and reread Rosina’s letter. “He did, after all, reveal everything to me and even read me letters she had sent, so there can be no doubt about what happened. Rosina is guilty; she deceived me; she allowed herself to be courted by another, all the while claiming that she loved only me. But then why this letter? If she loved the other man, why doesn’t she write to him? I need to investigate further.”",CO049CL10
11774,239,"This worthy young man hesitated for even longer when he entered Rua Nova do Conde, spending ten minutes walking back and forth, unable to come to a decision. Finally, he gave free rein to his heart and set off boldly along the path that fate appeared to have chosen for him.",CO049CL10
11775,240,"When he arrived at the Vieira residence, Rosina was in the parlor with her aunt. Rosina seemed genuinely glad to see him, but, as far as Ernesto could judge, that gladness was not enough to disguise the traces left by her tears. Indeed, the lovely Rosina’s usually mischievous eyes seemed veiled in melancholy. They were no longer mischievous, but dull or dead.",CO049CL10
11776,241,“The very picture of innocence!” Ernesto told himself.,CO049CL10
11777,242,"At the same time, he felt ashamed of such a benevolent opinion, and, remembering what the young man with the long nose had told him, he assumed a stern, serious air, not so much lover as judge, not so much judge as executioner. Rosina stared down at the floor.",CO049CL10
11778,243,"When her aunt asked Ernesto why he had not been to see them for so long, he attributed this to work and illness, the excuses used by anyone who has no genuine excuse. After a further brief exchange, the aunt left the room to give orders to the servants, having already surreptitiously told Juquinha to stay. Juquinha promptly climbed onto a chair and sat staring out of the window, thus giving Ernesto and Rosina time to talk.",CO049CL10
11779,244,"It was an awkward situation, but there was no time to lose, as Rosina instantly understood, for she immediately burst out:",CO049CL10
11780,245,“Do you feel no remorse?”,CO049CL10
11781,246,“For what?” asked Ernesto in astonishment.,CO049CL10
11782,247,“For what you did to me.”,CO049CL10
11783,248,“Me?”,CO049CL10
11784,249,"“Yes, abandoning me without a word of explanation. I can guess what lay behind it: some new suspicion, or, rather, some new calumny . . .”",CO049CL10
11785,250,"“There was no calumny and no suspicion,” said Ernesto after a moment’s silence, “just the truth.”",CO049CL10
11786,251,"Rosina muffled a cry; her pale, tremulous lips tried to speak, but failed; two large tears rolled down her cheeks. Ernesto could not bear to see her cry; however justified he felt in his suspicions, whenever he saw her crying, he would immediately relent and beg her forgiveness. This time, though, he could not easily go back to his former state of mind. His rival’s revelations were still fresh in his memory.",CO049CL10
11787,252,"However, he did give in to her and begged her not to cry.",CO049CL10
11788,253,"“Not cry?” she said in a tearful voice. “You ask me not to cry when I see my happiness slipping through my fingers, having lost any respect you once had for me, because you clearly do despise me, and without even knowing what the accusation is so that I could deny or disprove it . . .”",CO049CL10
11789,254,“Could you do that?” asked Ernesto passionately. “Could you prove the accusation to be wrong?”,CO049CL10
11790,255,"“I could,” she said, with a magnificently dignified look on her face.",CO049CL10
11791,256,"Ernesto summarized the conversation he’d had with the young man with the long nose, and concluded by saying that he had seen a letter she had written to him. Rosina listened in silence, clearly deeply distressed, her breast rising and falling. When he finished, she broke into loud sobs.",CO049CL10
11792,257,"“Please,” said Ernesto softly, “someone might hear you.”",CO049CL10
11793,258,"“I don’t care,” she cried, “I don’t care who hears.”",CO049CL10
11794,259,“But can you deny what I have just told you?”,CO049CL10
11795,260,"“Not all of it, no, because some of it is true,” she answered in a sad voice.",CO049CL10
11796,261,“Ah!”,CO049CL10
11797,262,"“The promise of marriage is a lie, and there were only two letters, and that . . . is your fault.”",CO049CL10
11798,263,"“Mine?” exclaimed Ernesto, as amazed as if he had just seen two candlesticks dancing.",CO049CL10
11799,264,"“Yes,” she said, “your fault. Don’t you remember? You had quarreled with me yet again, and I . . . I know it was foolish . . . but to give you a shock, to avenge myself . . . oh, I must have been mad . . . I did write to that impudent individual . . . it was madness on my part, I see that now . . . but what do you expect, I was so angry . . .”",CO049CL10
11800,265,"Ernesto’s heart was greatly shaken by this new version of events. He would have expected Rosina to deny everything if she had intended to act malevolently; she would have declared that someone had imitated her handwriting; but, no, she admitted everything with the greatest nobility and simplicity; except—and herein lay the key to the situation—she was attributing it all to the extremes to which anger had driven her, thus revealing beneath the frivolous pastry, if we can compare the heart to a cake, the pure cream of love.",CO049CL10
11801,266,"A few moments of silence ensued, in which she sat staring down at the floor, in the saddest, most melancholy pose ever struck by a repentant young woman.",CO049CL10
11802,267,“But did you not see that such madness could lead to my death?” said Ernesto.,CO049CL10
11803,268,"Rosina shuddered to hear these words uttered in the gentle tone of old; she glanced up at him, then back at the floor.",CO049CL10
11804,269,"“If I had thought that,” she said, “I would never have done what I did.”",CO049CL10
11805,270,"“Quite right,” Ernesto responded, but, still filled with a cruel desire for revenge, he felt that her frivolity should be punished with a few more minutes of doubt and recrimination.",CO049CL10
11806,271,"She listened to further accusations from Ernesto, and responded to them all with such contrition and with words so steeped in regret, that he almost felt his own eyes filling with tears. Rosina’s eyes were calmer now, and a lightness began to take the place of the melancholy shadows. The situation was almost as it had been a few weeks earlier; it needed only to be consolidated by time. Meanwhile, Rosina said:",CO049CL10

11820,3,"Norberto dried his eyes and sat on the edge of the bed, his legs dangling. I sat astride a chair, resting my chin on the chair back, and gave the following brief speech:",CO181CL10
11821,4,"“How often must I tell you, you little fool, to give up on this ridiculous, humiliating passion of yours? Yes, ‘ridiculous’ and ‘humiliating,’ because she doesn’t even know you exist. Besides, it’s dangerous. You don’t agree? Well, you’ll find out soon enough when the baron starts to suspect you of setting your cap at his wife. He certainly doesn’t look like the sweetest-tempered of men.”",CO181CL10
11822,5,"Norberto clutched his head in despair. Having waited for me in the street until nearly one o’clock in the morning, opposite the boardinghouse where I lived, he had finally written a letter, begging me to go to him and offer comfort and advice; in the letter he told me he hadn’t slept, that he’d received a terrible blow; he even talked of drowning himself. Despite the terrible blow that I, too, had received, I went to see my poor friend. We were both the same age, both of us studying medicine, the only difference being that I was currently repeating my third year, which I had failed out of sheer idleness.",CO181CL10
11823,6,"Norberto was still living with his parents; I was less fortunate, having lost both of mine, and I lived on an allowance from an uncle in Bahia, and on the debts that this good old man paid off for me every six months. He would then write me a letter full of invective, which always concluded by saying that I must continue my studies and become a doctor. But why? I asked myself. If neither the sun, the moon, the girls, nor the best Villegas cigars were doctors, what was the point in my becoming one? And so I laughed and played and let the weeks and the creditors roll by.",CO181CL10
11824,7,"I’ve just mentioned receiving a terrible blow of my own. This came in a letter from that same uncle, and arrived at the same time as Norberto’s, on the same morning. I opened my uncle’s letter first and read it, horrified. He no longer addressed me in his usual familiar way, but stiffly and formally: “Senhor Simeão Antônio de Barros, I have had enough of throwing my money away on you, sir. If you wish to finish your studies, then come and enroll in a university up here and live with me. If not, then you must find your own money, because you will receive nothing more from me.”",CO181CL10
11825,8,"I crumpled up the letter, stared hard at a very bad lithograph of the Viscount of Sepetiba—which had always been there in my boardinghouse room, hanging from a nail on the wall—and called him every name under the sun, from madman downward. I bawled at him that he could keep his money, that I was twenty years old, which was the very first of the rights of man, and took precedence over uncles and all other social conventions.",CO181CL10
11826,9,"My imagination—always my mother and my friend—immediately came up with endless possible sources of income, which would mean I could dispense with the paltry amount doled out by a miserly old man; however, after that initial defiant response, I reread the letter and began to see that the solution was not as easy as it seemed. Those other possible sources might be good and even reliable, but I had grown so accustomed to visiting Rua da Quitanda to collect my monthly allowance and then spend it twice over, that I would find it very hard to adopt any other system.",CO181CL10
11827,10,"It was then that I opened my friend Norberto’s letter and ran straight to his house. You already know what his letter said and saw him clutch his head in despair.

They were newly married; the baroness was about twenty-four, some thirty years younger than the baron. She really was very beautiful. Her childhood name had been Iaiá Lindinha, the Pretty Young Miss. The baron was an old friend of Norberto’s father, and the two families were immediately thrown together.",CO181CL10
11835,18,“Die for her?” I said.,CO181CL10
11836,19,"Norberto swore that he truly was capable of killing himself for her sake. She was such a mysterious creature! Her voice seeped into his very bones. And, saying this, he writhed about on the bed, pummeling his head and biting the pillows. He would stop occasionally, panting, then resume these convulsions, muffling his sobs and cries so that no one would hear him on the next floor.",CO181CL10
11837,20,"Since the arrival of the baroness, I had grown accustomed to my friend’s tears, and so I waited for them to cease. When they did not, I left my chair, went over to the bed, and yelled at him that he was behaving like a child, and that I was leaving. Norberto grabbed my hand to make me stay and explained that he had not yet told me the worst part.",CO181CL10

Then we could go together; we were close friends, his parents would surely not refuse this favor to our youthful friendship. Despite the many tears that she would shed to lose her son, his mother gave in more quickly than we had imagined.",CO181CL10
11844,27,"His father, however, would not agree. No amount of pleading and persuading could change his mind; I had managed to get the baron involved in our plan, too, but even he could not get his old friend to allow his son to go with him, not even with the promise that he would take him into his own house and watch over him. Norberto’s father proved utterly immovable.",CO181CL10
11845,28,"You can imagine my friend’s despair. I spent Friday night at his house with his family, and stayed until eleven o’clock. On the pretext of spending my last night in Rio together, he came back to my boardinghouse, and the tears he wept were so many and so bitter that I could neither doubt his passion nor presume to console him, it being the first passion he had experienced. Up until then, we had both known only the small change of love; and, alas for him, the first really valuable coin he had found was made not of gold or silver, but of iron, hard iron, like that of old Lycurgus, forged in the fire, then cooled in the same vinegar bath.",CO181CL10
11846,29,"We did not sleep at all. Norberto wept and moaned, calling for death to come, making absurd and terrifying plans. As I was packing my bags, I kept trying to console him, but this only made matters worse; it was like inviting a gimpy leg to a dance. I managed to get him to smoke a cigar, then another, and he ended up smoking dozens of them, but never finishing one. At around three o’clock in the morning, he was talking about running away from Rio de Janeiro, not immediately, but in a few days’ time, on the first steamship that would take him. I managed to dissuade him from this, purely in his own interests.",CO181CL10

11853,36,"Norberto was thrilled with this plan. It was, at least, a hope. He made me swear that I would keep my word, that I would fearlessly observe her, and he, for his part, swore that he would not waver for an instant. He urged me not to miss a thing, saying that sometimes the smallest gesture could be worth its weight in gold, that a single word could be a whole book; and he asked me, please, if I could, to tell her of the despairing state in which I had left him.",CO181CL10
11854,37,"To further shore up my determination, he said that disappointment would kill him, because his love, being eternal, would find rest only in death and eternity.

My uncle came on board, and, despite his attempt to maintain a stern demeanor, I could tell that he had a good heart and that he saw in me his late sister’s only child, and saw, too, that I was prepared to be obedient. My first impressions could not have been better. Ah, divine youth! These new things were more than enough to compensate for the old things I had left behind.",CO181CL10

The Baroness—or Iaiá Lindinha, the name by which everyone still knew her—received me with such good grace, and her husband was so kind and hospitable, that I felt ashamed of my mission. That shame was short-lived, though, for I could feel my friend’s despair, and the need either to console or to undeceive him was more important than anything else.",CO181CL10
11860,43,"Oddly enough, now that they were separated, I confess that I began to hope that she did actually like him, which was precisely what I had always refused to believe earlier. Perhaps it was a desire to see him happy, or perhaps merely the promptings of vanity, that made me hope I would prove victorious and save the poor unfortunate.",CO181CL10
11861,44,"Inevitably, we talked about Rio de Janeiro. I told her the things I missed most, we spoke of familiar sights, the streets that were almost part of my very being, the faces I saw every day, the houses, the friendships. Ah, yes, friendships were what bound one most closely to a place. I had friends, Norberto’s parents, for example—",CO181CL10

You might think me somewhat biased because he’s my friend, but the truth is, he is the person who binds me closest to Rio de Janeiro. Poor Norberto!

11868,51,"Only when I finished this speech did I realize how ridiculous it was. Iaiá Lindinha either didn’t think it ridiculous or pretended not to; she said only that I clearly valued my friend greatly, but that while he had seemed a very nice person, he was not exactly cheerful company or else appeared to suffer from frequent bouts of melancholia.

The scandal that ensues! People will—quite rightly—say that the author is a cynic, unworthy of the men who put their trust in him and of the women who loved him. A perfectly sincere and legitimate outcry, because public life imposes many barriers; the politeness and respect one owes to the women one has loved both demand silence . . .",CO181CL10

Nevertheless, the letters I sent to my poor friend somehow managed to convey neither hope nor despair. Some were actually more hopeful than despairing. The affection I felt for him and for my own pride combined forces to arouse in her at least some curiosity and intrigue about that remote, possible mystery.",CO181CL10

When three whole nights passed without my going to their house, I would be filled with torment and unrest, and when I rushed to see them on the fourth night, she would be waiting for me at the door, calling me all kinds of ugly things, ungrateful, idle, indifferent. This name-calling eventually ceased, but the person would still be there waiting, her sometimes tremulous hand ready to squeeze mine, or was it my hand that trembled? I’m not sure.

11877,60,"And I would explain either that I had to study or that I had promised to help my uncle. While she never tried to dissuade me, she was clearly disappointed. My letters to Norberto became less frequent and, when I did write, I hardly mentioned Iaiá Lindinha, as if I rarely went to her house. I used various different formulas: “Yesterday, near the palace, I bumped into the baron, who told me that his wife is well.” Or: “Do you know who I saw at the theater the other night? The baroness.”",CO181CL10
11878,61,"To avoid coming face-to-face with my own hypocrisy, I never reread my letters. For his part, Norberto also wrote less often, and then only briefly.

11879,62,"We skirted around the abyss, both of us insisting that it was merely a reflection of the celestial dome—a contradiction in terms for those who are not in love. Death finally solved the problem by carrying off the baron with an attack of apoplexy, on the twenty-third of March, 1861, at six o’clock in the evening.

She imposed one condition, that I must first finish my studies and qualify as a doctor. And she said this with lips that seemed to be the one book of the world, the universal book, the best of academies, the school of schools. I argued my case, but she heard me unmoved. The reason she gave was that my uncle might think that, once married, I would interrupt my studies.",CO181CL10

11882,65,"We both kept that promise. For a while, she went traveling in Europe with one of her sisters-in-law and the latter’s husband; and I missed her so much that those feelings became my hardest taskmasters. I studied patiently and abandoned all my former idle occupations. I graduated on the eve of our wedding, and I can say, without a hint of hypocrisy, that I found the priest’s Latin far superior to the graduation address.",CO181CL10
11883,66,"Some weeks later, Iaiá Lindinha asked if we could visit Rio de Janeiro. I agreed to her request, but confess that I felt distinctly uncomfortable. We would be sure to run into my friend Norberto, always assuming he still lived there. We had not written to each other for three years, and our last letters had been brief and rather dull. Would he know about our marriage? Or about what led up to it? We went to Rio, and I said nothing to my wife of these anxieties.",CO181CL10

When we arrived in Rio, I wondered whether I should wait for him to visit me or if I should be the one to seek him out; I chose the second option, in order to explain the situation to him. I dreamed up certain special, curious circumstances engineered by Providence itself, the threads of whose web are always hidden from mankind.

She was five months old, he said, but if I came back in fifteen years’ time, I’d find a big, strong, healthy girl. What arms! What fat fingers!

11900,83,"“Don’t be embarrassed, Carmela,” he said. “Do you know who this gentleman is? He’s Simeão Barros, the medical student I’ve often spoken to you about. By the way, Simeão, why did you never respond to our wedding invitation?”",CO181CL10

I slowed my pace, and stood looking at the waves rising and falling.

11919,3,"First of all, let’s agree that he could hardly be less like Romeo. He was forty-five, when I first met him; I’ll not say when, because everything in this story will be mysterious and elliptical. Forty-five, then, and with a lot of black hair; for the ones that weren’t that colour, he used a chemical process so effective you couldn’t tell which were black and which weren’t – except when he got out of bed; but when he got out of bed there was no one to see him.",CO147CL04

11921,5,"Morally, he was what he was. No one can change their character, and Benedito’s was good – or, to put it another way, easy-going. Intellectually, however, he was less original. We might compare him to an inn with plenty of guests, where ideas of all kinds from all over the place resorted; they sat down at table with the innkeeper’s family. Sometimes two enemies, or just people who didn’t much like one another, met up; no one quarrelled, and mine host imposed a mutual forbearance.",CO147CL04

He played the organ, and was very fond of music, speaking about it enthusiastically, quoting from the operas, all the best passages, and informed me that when he was a child he’d begun to learn the flute; he soon abandoned it – which was a pity, he concluded, for it is a truly poignant instrument.",CO147CL04
11944,28,"He showed me other rooms; we went into the garden, which was splendid, for art assisted nature, just as nature crowned art. Roses, for example – there’s no denying that the rose is the queen of flowers, he said – he had roses of all kinds and from every region.",CO147CL04

He savoured them so much that I don’t know if he’d have accepted true liberty without these verbal trappings; I think not. I even think that, if he’d had to choose between the two, he’d have opted for these short phrases, so convenient, some beautiful, some sonorous, all of them axiomatically true, which don’t force one to think; they fill any gaps, and leave one at peace with God and our fellow men.",CO147CL04

12057,31,"All of this was ingenious, but here’s the more ingenious thing. He didn’t invite them to learn. One night, looking at the sky, he said that the stars were shining a lot - and what were the stars? By any chance did they know what the stars were?",CO148CL07
12058,32,"“No, sir.”",CO148CL07

That was what happened.",CO148CL07
12063,37,"After three weeks, they seem to have been raised together. That alone was enough to change Caetaninha’s life. But Raimundo brought her more. Within ten minutes of watching her look longingly at the cavalcades of men and ladies who passed by on the street, Raimundo ended her longing, teaching her to ride despite the reluctance of the old man, who feared disaster. But he gave in and hired two horses.",CO148CL07

Soon thereafter it was a pleasure to see them both, gallant and intrepid, up and down the mountain.",CO148CL07
12065,39,"At home they played freely, played checkers and cards, took care of birds and plants. Often they bickered, but, according to the slave women, they were make-believe fights, only for them to make up afterward, a passing peevishness. Sometimes Raimundo went into the city, sent by his uncle. Caetaninha waited for him at the gate, watching anxiously. When he arrived, they argued because she wanted to take the largest packages from him under the pretext that he was tired, and he wanted to give her smallest ones, alleging she was a weakling.",CO148CL07
12066,40,"At the end of four months, life was completely different. It could even be said that only then did Caetaninha begin to wear roses in her hair. Beforehand she often showed up for lunch with her hair unbrushed. Now, not only was her hair brushed early, but even, as I said, she brought roses, one or two. Either she picked them herself the evening before and kept them in water, or he picked them that same morning to bring to her at her window.",CO148CL07
12067,41,"The window was high, but Raimundo, standing on tip-toe and raising his arm, managed to hand the roses to her. It was around that time that he picked up the habit of smoothing his filmy whiskers with his finger. Caetaninha took to smacking his fingers to get him out of that bad habit.",CO148CL07
12068,42,"Meanwhile, the lessons continued regularly. By then they had a general idea of the universe, and a definition of life, which neither of them understood. Thus they came to the fifth month. On the sixth began the proof of the existence of man. Caetaninha couldn’t suppress a laugh when her godfather, expounding on the topic, asked them if they knew that they existed and why, but she quickly got serious and answered no.",CO148CL07

It had rained a lot the previous days, but the sun now flooded all with light, and the country place seemed like a beautiful widow who changes her mourning veil for that of a bride. Raimundo, as if he wanted to emulate the sun (the great tend to copy each other), sent out a vast and faraway look from his pupils. Caetaninha took it in, throbbing like the country home - a fusion, transfusion, diffusion, confusion and profusion of beings and things.",CO148CL07
12072,46,"While the old man talked - straightforward, logical, stalwart, enjoying the formulas, his eyes fixed on nothing - the two students made thirty thousand efforts to listen, but thirty thousand events distracted them. At first it was a pair of butterflies who played in the air. Do me the favor of telling me what could be extraordinary about a couple of butterflies? I agree that they were yellow, but the circumstances aren’t enough to explain the distraction. The fact that they flew one after the other, now to the right, now to the left, now down, now up, does not explain the detour, seeing that butterflies never fly in a straight line like simple soldiers.",CO148CL07

12074,48,"Raimundo looked at Caetaninha and found her looking at him. They both seemed confused and shy. She was the first to lower her eyes to her lap. Then she raised them to look somewhere else, somewhere far off, the wall around the grounds, but as they went there, since Raimundo’s were still there, she looked off as quickly as she could. Fortunately, the wall presented a spectacle that filled her with wonder. A couple of swallows (it was a day of couples) hopped around on the wall with the grace of people with wings.",CO148CL07
12075,49,"They peeped as they hopped, saying things to each other, whatever it was, maybe this - that it was quite nice that there was no philosophy on the walls of country homes. But when one of them flew - probably the lady - the other, naturally, the boy, did not let himself fall behind. He spread his wings and went the same way. Caetaninha lowered her eyes to the grass on the ground.",CO148CL07

Caetaninha withdrew to her room, stayed shut in there for three-quarters of an hour, sitting, then to the window, back and forth, looking for things she had in her hand, and reaching the paroxysm of seeing herself on horseback, the road ahead of her, Raimundo to her side. Suddenly she saw the boy on the wall outside, but she focused better and saw it was a couple of bugs humming in the air. And one said to the other:",CO148CL07

12092,66,"In that way the two bugs spoke. She heard them ruminating. As soon as they disappeared, she went into the house, saw the time and left the bedroom. Raimundo was out. She went to await him at the gate, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty minutes. When he got back, they spoke little. They came together and separated two or three times. The last time it was she who brought him to the veranda to show him an ornament she thought she had lost and had just found.",CO148CL07
12093,67,"It does them justice to believe that it was pure lie. Meanwhile, Fulgêncio moved the lesson up, gave it the next day, between lunch and dinner. Never had the word left him so lucidly and simply. And that’s the way it should be. He talked about the existence of man, a deeply metaphysical chapter, in which it was necessary to consider everything from all sides.",CO148CL07

12095,69,“Perfectly.”,CO148CL07
12096,70,"And the lesson went on to an end. At the end, the same thing happened as on the day before. Caetaninha, as if afraid of being alone, asked him to go on or to take a walk, and he refused both, patted her paternally on the cheek, and shut himself in his study.",CO148CL07

At one point, she saw the young man standing by the garden wall, but, on closer inspection she realized it was a pair of beetles buzzing through the air.

The last time it was she who took him to the veranda, to show him a trinket she thought she’d lost and had just found.",CO148CL12
12167,67,"Readers, please do her the justice of believing that this was a blatant lie. Meanwhile, Fulgêncio brought the next lesson forward and gave it on the following day between lunch and dinner.

12179,5,"Caetaninha took the book from his hands. Her godfather turned on his heel and went into his study, where there was no shortage of books. He shut the door behind him and carried on reading. It was his vice; he read to excess—morning, noon, and night, at lunch and dinner, in bed, after his bath, while walking or standing up, in the house and in the garden; he read before reading and he read after reading. He read every sort of book, but especially law (for he was a law graduate), mathematics, and philosophy; recently, he had also taken up the natural sciences.",CO148CL10
12180,6,"Worse than going blind, he went mad. It was toward the end of 1873, up in Tijuca, that he began to show signs of mental derangement.

12184,10,"And, once more burying his nose in the book, he carried on with his reading. Caetaninha discussed the matter with the house-slaves, who told her they had suspected for some time that he wasn’t well. You can imagine the young lady’s fears, but her fear soon passed, leaving only pity, which merely made her feel still fonder of him. Also, his mania was harmless enough, for it extended only to books. Fulgêncio lived for the written word, the printed word, the doctrinal and the abstract, for principles and formulas.",CO148CL10
12185,11,"Over time, he reached the point of theoretical hallucination, although not yet superstition. One of his maxims was that freedom would not die as long as there remained one piece of paper on which to declare it. One day, waking up with the idea of improving the condition of the Turks, he drafted a constitution and sent it to the British envoy in Petrópolis, as a gift. On another occasion, he applied himself to studying the anatomy of the eyes, to see if they really could see, and concluded that they could.",CO148CL10
12186,12,"Tell me how, under such conditions, Caetaninha’s life could possibly be happy? It’s true that she wanted for nothing, because her godfather was a rich man. It was he himself who had brought her up from the age of seven, when he lost his wife; he taught her reading and writing, then French, a little history and geography (which is tantamount to saying almost nothing), and charged one of the house-slaves with teaching her embroidery, lace-making, and sewing. So much is true.",CO148CL10
12187,13,"But Caetaninha was now fourteen, and, if toys and slaves had once been enough to amuse her, she was reaching the age when toys lose their appeal and slaves their interest, and when no amount of reading and writing can make a paradise of a secluded house up in Tijuca.",CO148CL10
12188,14,"She sometimes went down to the city, but these were rare occasions, and always very rushed; she didn’t visit the theater or go to dances, and she neither made nor received visits.

12191,17,“May I speak with him?”,CO148CL10
12192,18,"Caetaninha replied that she would go and see; she entered the house and went to the study, where she found her godfather ruminating over a chapter of Hegel with the most devoutly voluptuous expression on his face. “A young man? What young man?” Caetaninha told him that it was a young man dressed in mourning.",CO148CL10
12193,19,"“In mourning?” repeated the old man, snapping the book shut; it must be him.",CO148CL10
12194,20,"I forgot to say (but there is time for everything) that a brother of Fulgêncio’s had passed away three months earlier, up north, leaving an illegitimate son. Since the brother, a few days before dying, had written to Fulgêncio asking him to take care of the soon-to-be orphan, Fulgêncio sent for the boy to come to Rio de Janeiro. Upon hearing that a young man in mourning had arrived, he concluded that he must be his nephew, and concluded correctly. It was indeed him.",CO148CL10

12197,23,"However, the house was large and well appointed, and, an hour later, the young man was comfortably lodged in a beautiful room overlooking the kitchen garden, the old well, the laundry, copious lush greenery, and an immense blue sky.",CO148CL10
12198,24,"I don’t believe I have yet revealed the new guest’s age. He is fifteen years old, with just a hint of fuzz on his upper lip; in fact, he’s almost a child. So if Caetaninha quickly became flustered, and the slave-women began rushing hither and thither, peering around doors and talking about “the ole master’s nephew come from far away,” it’s because nothing much happened in that house, not because he was a grown man.

Caetaninha retired to her room and stayed there for three-quarters of an hour, with the door closed, either seated or standing at the window or pacing back and forth, or else looking for something she was already holding in her hand, and even going so far as to imagine herself riding up the road alongside Raimundo. At one point, she saw the young man standing by the garden wall, but, on closer inspection she realized it was a pair of beetles buzzing through the air.

Someone knew of a farmstead where it could be found, when the tree produced it; but for now it wasn’t producing anything.

He explained to them the idea that came to his mind when he heard Friar Simão’s words, in the tone with which they were said, and accompanied by the stare which fulminated him.

12351,44,"By the end of two months of frustrated waiting and active correspondence, Helena’s aunt caught a letter from Simão. I believe it was the twentieth. There was a great storm in the house. The uncle rushed from his office and came to know the facts. As a result, he banished ink and paper from his house and instituted rigorous vigilance over the unhappy girl.",CO002CL09
12352,45,"The letters directed to the poor exiled young man began to decrease. The young man inquired the reasons for such thing in long, emotional letters; but as the rigorous control in Simão’s house acquired extraordinary proportions, all the letters written by the young man ended in the hands of the old man, who, after appreciating his son’s loving style, burned the passionate epistles.",CO002CL09
12353,46,"Days and months went by, and no letter from Helena was received. The correspondent exhausted his creative vein, and he didn’t know how to hold the young man anymore. Simão receives a letter. It was his father’s handwriting. The only difference was that this letter was longer, much longer than the others.",CO002CL09
12354,47,"The young man opened the letter and, trembling and pale, read it. In this letter, the honored tradesman told his son that Helena, the good girl he’d intended to make his own daughter by marrying her to Simão, the good Helena had died. The old man copied some of the latest obituaries he saw in the newspapers and added some home consolations. The last consolation told Simão to embark for home to be with him.",CO002CL09
12355,48,The last sentence of the letter said the following:,CO002CL09
12356,49,"Anyway, my business hasn’t worked out; I couldn’t marry you to Helena, as God took her. But come back, my son; you could console yourself marrying another girl, the daughter of counselor ***. She is a grown up woman and a good catch. Don’t be sad; remember me.",CO002CL09
12357,50,"Simão’s father didn’t know the extension of his son’s love, and he wasn’t a big genius at assessing him even though he knew him. Such pains cannot be consoled with a letter or with marriage to a counselor’s daughter. It was better to call him over and prepare him to receive the news, because to put down coldly in a letter was to expose the young man to certain death.",CO002CL09
12358,51,"Simão’s death was contrary, not certain. His body was alive, but he was morally dead, so dead that he got the idea to go look for a grave. This would be a good place to show some of the papers Simão had written about his suffering after receiving the letter; but there are many flaws, and I don’t want to cripple the friar’s naive and miserable position.",CO002CL09
12359,52,"The grave chosen by Simão was a friary. He answered his father that he appreciated the counselor’s daughter, saying that, from that moment on, he belonged to God’s service.",CO002CL09
12360,53,"His father was impressed. He never suspected that his son could make such resolution. He hurriedly wrote to him to see if he could make the young man change his mind, but it was impossible.",CO002CL09

The reason was simple. Being used to the lively pictures of Pedro Botelho’s cauldrons and other golden tidbits used by the majority of preachers, the people couldn’t pleasurably listen to the simple, soft and persuasive language used in the sermons of the man who was the base of our church.",CO002CL09

12378,71,It was Helena.,CO002CL09

Thanks to the care he received, he was able to recover, and it seemed to everybody that he was cured, except for the doctor, who wanted to continue the healing. But the friar said positively that he was retiring to the cloister, and there were no human forces that could make him change his mind.",CO002CL09

12392,4,"Brother Simão was a suspicious, taciturn man. He would spend whole days in his cell, from which he only emerged at mealtimes and for divine service. He had not a single friend in the whole monastery, because he made it impossible for anyone even to attempt the necessary preliminary stages that both begin and consolidate any friendship.",CO002CL10
12393,5,"In a monastery, where the deep communion of souls should be taken for granted, Brother Simão appeared to be the exception to the rule. One of the novices nicknamed him the Bear, and the name stuck, although only among the other novices. And yet, even though Brother Simão’s solitary nature was displeasing to the ordained friars, they nevertheless felt a degree of respect, even veneration, for him.",CO002CL10

12395,7,"During that time, his fellow friars crowded into Brother Simão’s cell. He spoke not a word until, when the final moment was approaching, he sat up in bed, beckoned the abbot over to his bedside, and whispered in a strange, muffled voice:",CO002CL10
12396,8,“I die filled with a loathing for humanity!”,CO002CL10
12397,9,"The abbot recoiled when he heard these words and the manner in which they were spoken. As for Brother Simão, he fell back on his pillow and passed into eternity.",CO002CL10
12398,10,"When all the usual honors had been paid to their dead brother, the other friars asked the abbot what Brother Simão had said that had so frightened him. The abbot told them, crossing himself as he did so. The friars, however, saw in those words only some past secret, which, though grave, was certainly not dreadful enough to instill terror into the abbot’s heart. Then the abbot told them what he had thought on hearing those vengeful words and seeing the terrible piercing look that accompanied them. He had felt sure then that Brother Simão was mad, indeed, that he had been mad when he first entered the order.",CO002CL10
12399,11,"The other friars said that while Brother Simão’s silent, solitary habits might well have been symptoms of some mental illness, albeit of a very mild and gentle sort, it seemed impossible that, during the eight years he had spent there, Brother Simão should have shown no further signs of madness. The abbot, however, was unconvinced.",CO002CL10

12401,13,"These papers were a great find for the community, who were all curious to know more. They would finally be able to peer behind the mysterious veil obscuring Brother Simão’s past life, and thus perhaps confirm the abbot’s suspicions. To this end the papers were duly read by everyone.",CO002CL10

12406,18,"At the time, a cousin of his lived with them; her mother and father had both died, leaving her to be cared for, brought up, and maintained by her aunt and uncle, Simão’s parents, who, it would seem, had money enough to do so. Her father had been a rich man, but, having lost everything to gambling and unfortunate business dealings, had ended up in absolute poverty.",CO002CL10
12407,19,"This orphaned cousin was called Helena; she was beautiful, affectionate, and extremely kindhearted. Simão, who had been brought up with her and lived with her under the same roof, could not resist his cousin’s fine qualities or her beauty. They fell in love. And in their dreams for the future, they both assumed they would marry, which is, after all, the most natural of ambitions for two loving hearts.",CO002CL10
12408,20,"It did not take long for Simão’s parents to find out about their love. Now, even though this is not stated in the friar’s notes, it must be said that his parents were uncommonly selfish.

As long as land was in sight Simão did not leave the deck, and it was only when, to use Ribeyrolles’s picturesque phrase, the walls of that moving prison finally closed about him, that Simão, filled with sadness and a sense of dread, went down to his cabin. A kind of presentiment was telling him that he would never see his cousin again. He felt as if he were being sent into exile.",CO002CL10

The pretext for the journey is my need to finish off some business I have with you, and that is what you should tell the lad, always assuring him that this will take little or no time at all. I recall that, in your youth, you harbored the rather sad ambition to be a novelist, well, now is your chance to invent as many unforeseen circumstances and occurrences as you wish, with the aim of keeping the boy there until you hear further from me.

12434,46,"Days and months passed without a single letter from Helena. By then, Amaral’s inventive vein had dried up, and he had run out of excuses for keeping Simão there. Then Simão received a letter written in his father’s hand. The only thing that distinguished it from other missives he had received from his father was its much greater length.",CO002CL10
12435,47,"When Simão opened the letter and read it, he trembled and turned pale. For in the letter, the honest businessman told him that Helena, the lovely girl whom he had thought to make his daughter when she married Simão, had died.

Before 1863 it wouldn’t have been this way because until then he was self-absorbed, reserved, living on the road to the Botanical Garden, where he went by omnibus or mule. He had a wife and son living, an unmarried daughter of thirteen. It was in that year that he began to occupy himself with other things besides his family, revealing a universal and generous spirit.

12540,7,"He marveled to think that thousands of other people would be reading the article at the same time as him, and he imagined them commenting, querying, and confirming what they had read; indeed, thanks to a phenomenon of hallucination that science will someday explain, and which is not that uncommon, he really did hear, quite distinctly, several of those readers’ voices. He heard them describe him as a good man, a worthy gentleman, a loyal friend, hardworking and honest: all the qualifications he had seen employed to describe others, and which in his quiet, reclusive life he had never presumed would be applied—typographically—to him.",CO149CL10
12541,8,"“The printing press is a great invention,” he said to his wife.",CO149CL10
12542,9,"It was Dona Maria Antônia who unmasked the author; the article was indeed by Xavier. He declared that he was only admitting this out of consideration for the lady of the house, and added that the tribute had not been as fulsome as he had intended, because his plan had been for the article to be published in all the newspapers, but, in the end, he had only finished writing it at seven o’clock in the evening and there had been no time to make copies. Fulano Beltrão corrected this failing, if it could be called a failing, by having the article transcribed in the Diário do Rio and the Correio Mercantil.",CO149CL10
12543,10,"Even if this event does not explain the change in our friend’s life, the fact remains that, from that year onward, and, more precisely, from the month of March, Fulano began to appear more often in public. Until then, he had been a stick-in-the-mud who didn’t attend society gatherings, didn’t vote in political elections, and didn’t go to the theaters, or to anything at all. But already by the end of March, on the twenty-second or twenty-third, he had presented the Santa Casa de Misericórdia Hospital with a Spanish lottery ticket, and received a dignified letter from the chairman, thanking him on behalf of the poor.",CO149CL10
12544,11,"He consulted his wife and friends as to whether he should publish the letter or put it away, being somewhat concerned that not publishing it might be seen as a discourtesy. And so, on March 26, the letter was sent to all the papers, one of which added an extensive commentary on the pious devotion of the donor. Of those who read the piece, many naturally remembered Xavier’s article, and linked the two: “Why, it’s that very same Fulano Beltrão who . . .” etc. Such are the foundations upon which a man’s reputation is built.",CO149CL10
12545,12,"It’s getting late, and we have to go and hear the will, so I shan’t give all the details now, but will simply say that the iniquities of life found in him an active and eloquent avenger, and that misery, particularly the dramatic sort, begotten of fire or flood, found in my friend the instigator of the kind of charitable relief that, in such cases, must be both immediate and public.",CO149CL10
12546,13,"There was no one like him when it came to that sort of thing. It was the same with freeing slaves. Before the Law of September 28, 1871, came into force, it was very common for slave-children to turn up in the Praça do Comércio begging the merchants to help them purchase their freedom. Fulano Beltrão would sign up for three-quarters of the contributions necessary, and with such success that within a few minutes the full price was covered.",CO149CL10
12547,14,"The recognition he received further encouraged him, and even gave him ideas that might not otherwise have occurred to him. I won’t even mention the ball he gave to celebrate the Battle of Riachuelo, because it was a ball planned long before news of the victory reached Rio, and he did no more than invest it with a higher purpose than mere family entertainment, placing the portrait of Admiral Barroso among a display of flags and naval trophies in the hall of honor, opposite the Emperor’s portrait, and, during the supper, he offered several patriotic toasts, all as reported in the newspapers of 1865.",CO149CL10
12548,15,"But here, for example, we have a typical case of the influence that the just recognition of others can have on our own conduct. Fulano Beltrão was returning one day from the Treasury, where he had gone to sort out some taxes. As he was passing the Lampadosa Church, he remembered that he had been baptized there; and no man can recall such things without going back through all the years and events of his life, curling up once more in his mother’s lap, laughing and playing as he would never again laugh and play.",CO149CL10
12549,16,"Fulano Beltrão was no exception; he went up the steps and entered the church, so simple and modest, and yet to him so rich and beautiful. As he left, he made a resolution, which he put into action a few days later, to send the church a gift, a superb silver candlestick, engraved, along with the donor’s name, with two dates: the date of the donation and the date of his baptism. The gift was reported in all the papers, not least since they received the news twice, because the church authorities understood (and with good reason) that it was also incumbent on them to disclose the donation to all and sundry.",CO149CL10
12550,17,"Within three years or less, my friend had entered the public imagination; his name was remembered, even when no recent event suggested it, and not only remembered but endowed with adjectives. His absence was commented upon, his presence sought out. Thus, Dona Maria Antônia saw the biblical snake enter her Eden, not to tempt her, but to tempt Adam.",CO149CL10
12551,18,"Indeed, her husband had so many places to visit, so many things to take care of, as well as putting in frequent appearances outside Bernardo’s Emporium on Rua do Ouvidor, that their former domestic intimacy became positively strained. Dona Maria Antônia told him so. He agreed, but assured her that it could not be otherwise, and that, in any event, if his habits had changed, his sentiments had not. He had a moral obligation to society; no man is an island and so on, hence his recent neglect of domestic duties. The truth is that their lives had been too secluded; it was neither right nor decorous.",CO149CL10
12552,19,"It was certainly not appropriate; their daughter was reaching the age of matrimony, and a closed house carries a whiff of the convent about it. A carriage, for example. Why on earth didn’t they have a carriage? Dona Maria Antônia felt a brief frisson of excitement, but, after a moment’s reflection, she protested.",CO149CL10
12553,20,“No. Whatever for? Certainly not. We don’t need a carriage.”,CO149CL10
12554,21,"“I’ve already bought one,” lied her husband.",CO149CL10
12555,22,"But here we are at the probate office. No one else has arrived yet; let’s wait at the door. Are you in a hurry? It’ll only take twenty minutes at most. Anyway, it’s true, he bought a fine carriage, a victoria, no less; and, for someone who, purely out of modesty, had for so many years traveled on the back of a mule or squeezed into a public omnibus, it was not easy to get used to this new mode of transport. To this I attribute his jutting, forward-leaning posture during those first few weeks, his eyes darting to left and right like someone looking for some particular person or house. Eventually he became accustomed to it and began to lean back in his seat, although without that air of indifference or nonchalance which his wife and daughter had in abundance, perhaps because they were women.",CO149CL10
12556,23,"As a matter of fact, the two ladies did not like going out in the carriage, but he was so insistent, regardless of whether or not they had any particular place to go, that they had no alternative but to obey. And so they became a well-known sight around the city; as soon as anyone caught so much as a distant glimpse of two ladies’ dresses, along with a certain coachman on the driver’s seat, everyone would immediately say: “Here comes Fulano Beltrão’s family.” And this, without perhaps him realizing it, made him even better known.",CO149CL10
12557,24,"He entered politics in 1868. I remember the year because it coincided with the fall of the liberals and the return of the conservatives. It was only a month or two before this, in March or April 1868, that he announced he was joining the ruling party, not surreptitiously, but with a great fanfare. It was, perhaps, the lowest point in my friend’s life. He was utterly devoid of political ideas; at best, he had one of those temperaments that is a kind of substitute for ideas, and gives the impression that a man is thinking when he is merely sweating.",CO149CL10
12558,25,"He gave in, however, to a momentary hallucination. He saw himself making pithy remarks in the Chamber, or leaning against the balustrade in conversation with the prime minister, who smiled at him with a grave, governmental intimacy. And it was there that the gallery, in the theatrical sense of the word, would gaze down upon him. He did everything he could to enter the legislature, but when he was halfway there, the government collapsed. Recovering from this shock, he had the presence of mind to tell Viscount Itaboraí the exact opposite of what he had said to the outgoing Zacarias, or perhaps it was the same thing; but, in any event, he lost the election and bowed out of politics. He behaved more wisely when he got himself involved with the prelates over the issue of freemasonry.",CO149CL10
12559,26,"He had kept quiet, at first; on the one hand, he himself was a Mason; on the other, he wanted to respect his wife’s religious sentiments. But the dispute reached such proportions that he could no longer remain silent; he entered the debate with the same passion, enthusiasm, and publicity that he poured into everything; he held meetings at which he spoke at length about freedom of conscience and the Mason’s right to don his apron; he signed petitions, representations, and letters of congratulations, and opened wide both his heart and his pocketbook.",CO149CL10
12560,27,"His wife died in 1878. She had asked to be buried without pomp and ceremony, and he did precisely that, because he truly loved her and considered her final wishes a decree from heaven. He had already lost his son; and his daughter, by then married, had gone off to Europe. My friend shared his pain with the public at large, and, although he did bury his wife without any pomp and ceremony, he nevertheless sent to Italy to have a magnificent mausoleum made for her which the whole of Rio was able to admire for nearly a month, when it was displayed on Rua do Ouvidor. His daughter even came to attend the inauguration. I lost touch with them around four years ago.",CO149CL10
12561,28,"He fell ill recently and, just over two months later, that illness carried him off to a better place. Note that, until the final death throes set in, he never lost either his wits or his strength of mind. He would chat with his visitors, get them to tell him all the news, and was always sure to reveal the names of his previous visitors to the new arrivals, a pointless exercise, since a sympathetic newspaper always published the full list. He had the papers read to him even on the morning of the day he died, and in one of them a brief article about his illness seemed in some way to reinvigorate him. But as the day wore on, he weakened somewhat, and, in the evening, he died.",CO149CL10
12562,29,"I can see you’re getting bored. They really are taking their time. Wait, I think that’s them. Yes, it is. Let’s go in. Here’s our magistrate, and he’s starting to read the will. Are you listening? All this painstaking genealogy is hardly necessary, well beyond the usual notarial requirements; but I suppose the mere fact of listing the entire family since his great-great-great-grandfather is evidence of my friend’s patient and meticulous nature. He certainly hasn’t left anything out. The funeral ceremony he sets out is long and complicated, but beautiful. Now begins the list of legacies. They’re all charitable; some industrial. You see laid before you the soul of my friend. Thirty contos . . .",CO149CL10
12563,30,"Thirty contos for what? To open a public subscription for the purpose of erecting a statue of Captain Pedro Álvares Cabral. “We Brazilians must not forget Cabral,” says the will, “for he was the precursor to our Empire.”",CO149CL10
12564,31,"It recommends that the statue be made of bronze, with four medallions on the pedestal, viz., a portrait of Bishop Coutinho, president of the Constituent Assembly, one of Gonzaga, leader of the Minas Conspiracy, and portraits of two citizens of the present generation “noted for their patriotism and liberalism,” to be chosen by the commission, which he himself appointed to complete the undertaking.",CO149CL10
12565,32,"Whether or not it comes to anything, I can’t say; we, of course, lack the determination of the first subscriber. However, should the commission carry out its task properly, and this South American sun of ours ever see the statue of Cabral erected, it would be an honor to us all if the distinguished features of my late friend were to appear on one of the medallions.

12568,3,"THE DEATH OF Joaquim Fidélis caused indescribable consternation throughout the suburb of Engenho Velho, and particularly in the hearts of his dearest friends. It was so unexpected. He was in fine fettle, had an iron constitution, and, the very night before he passed away, had been attending a ball where he had been seen happily chatting away. He had even danced, at the request of a lady in her sixties, the widow of a friend of his, who took him by the arm and said:",CO150CL12
12569,4,"“Come on, then, let’s show these youngsters that their elders still know a thing or two!”",CO150CL12
12570,5,"Joaquim Fidélis protested with a smile, but did as he was told and danced. It was two o’clock in the morning when he left, wrapping his sixty years in a warm winter cape (for it was June 1879), covering his bald head with the hood, lighting a cigar, and hopping nimbly into his carriage.",CO150CL12
12571,6,"He may well have nodded off in the carriage, but, once home, despite the late hour and his heavy eyelids, he went to his desk, opened a drawer, took out one of many notebooks, and, in three or four minutes, wrote some ten or eleven lines. His last words were these: “Altogether a vile ball; some aging reveler forced me to dance a quadrille with her; at the door, a dark-skinned country bumpkin asked me for a present. Simply vile!” He put the notebook back in the drawer, undressed, got into bed, fell asleep, and died.",CO150CL12
12572,7,"Yes, indeed, the news dismayed the whole neighborhood. So beloved was he, with his fine manners and his ability to be able to talk to anyone; he could be educated with the educated, ignorant with the ignorant, boyish with the boys, even girlish with the girls. And then, most obligingly, he was always ready to write letters, speak to friends, patch up quarrels, or lend money. In the evenings, a handful of close acquaintances from Engenho Velho, and sometimes other parts of the city, would gather in his house to play ombre or whist and discuss politics. Joaquim Fidélis had been a member of the Chamber of Deputies until its dissolution by the Marquis of Olinda in 1863.",CO150CL12
12573,8,"Unable to get reelected, he abandoned public life. He was a conservative, a label he had difficulty in accepting because it sounded to him like a political Gallicism. He preferred to be called one of the “Saquarema Set.” But he gave it all up, and it seems that, in recent times, he detached himself first from the party, and, eventually, from the party’s politics. There are reasons to believe that, from a certain point onward, he was merely a profound skeptic.",CO150CL12
12574,9,"He was a wealthy and educated man. He had qualified as a lawyer in 1842. Now he did nothing, but read a great deal. There were no women in his house. Widowed after the first outbreak of yellow fever, he refused to countenance a second marriage, to the great sorrow of three or four ladies, who for some time had hopes in that regard. One of them perfidiously managed to make her beautiful 1845 ringlets last until well after her second grandchild was born; another younger woman, also a widow, thought she could hold on to him with concessions that were as generous as they were irretrievable.",CO150CL12
12575,10,"“My dear Leocádia,” he would say whenever she hinted at a marital solution, “why don’t we carry on just as we are? Mystery is what gives life its charm.” He lived with a nephew called Benjamin, the orphaned son of one of his sisters who had died when the child was still very young. Joaquim Fidélis brought him up and made him study hard, so much so that the boy graduated with a law degree in the year of 1877.",CO150CL12
12576,11,"Benjamin was utterly dumbfounded. He could not bring himself to believe that his uncle was dead. He rushed to his bedroom, found the corpse lying in bed, cold, eyes wide open, and a faintly ironic curl to the left-hand corner of his mouth. He wept profusely. He was losing not just a relative but a father, a tenderhearted, dedicated father, one of a kind. Finally, Benjamin wiped away his tears and, since it upset him to see the dead man’s eyes open and his lip curled, he rectified both defects. Thus death took on a more tragic but less original expression.",CO150CL12
12577,12,"“No! I don’t believe it!” cried Diogo Vilares, one of the neighbors, shortly after hearing the news.",CO150CL12
12578,13,"Diogo Vilares was one of Joaquim Fidélis’s five closest friends. He owed to him the job he had held since 1857. Diogo was followed by the four others in quick succession, all speechless and unable to believe what had happened. The first was Elias Xavier, who had obtained a knighthood, thanks, it was said, to the deceased’s timely intervention; then came João Brás, another deputy who, under the rather peculiar rules of the time, had been elected to the Chamber thanks to Joaquim Fidélis’s influence.",CO150CL12
12579,14,"Last of all came Fragoso and Galdino, who, in lieu of diplomas, knighthoods, or jobs, owed him other favors instead. Fidélis had advanced Galdino a small amount of capital, and had arranged a good marriage for Fragoso. And now he was dead! Gone forever! Standing around the bed, they gazed at his serene face and recalled their last get-together the previous Sunday, so intimate and yet so jolly! And, even more recently, the night before last, when their customary game of ombre had lasted until eleven o’clock.",CO150CL12
12580,15,"“Don’t come tomorrow,” Joaquim Fidélis had said to them. “I’m going to Carvalhinho’s ball.”",CO150CL12

12584,19,"Many persons of note came to the funeral: two senators, a former minister, a few noblemen, wealthy businessmen, lawyers, merchants, and doctors; but the coffin was carried by Benjamin and those five close friends. None of them would yield this honor to anyone, considering it their final and inalienable duty.",CO150CL12
12585,20,"The graveside eulogy was given by João Brás; it was a touching address, slightly too polished for such an unexpected event, but nonetheless excusable. When everyone had deposited their shovelful of earth on the coffin, the mourners slowly slipped away from the graveside, apart from those six, who stayed to oversee the gravediggers as they went indifferently about their work. They stayed there until the grave had been filled to the very top and the funeral wreaths laid out upon it.",CO150CL12

12588,23,"“I hope that Uncle Joaquim’s friends will also be my friends,” he said.",CO150CL12
12589,24,"They went in and, while they ate, they talked about the dead man, each one recounting some story, some witty remark; they were unanimous in their praise and fond regrets. Since each of them had asked for a little memento of the deceased, when they finished breakfast they all went through into his study and chose something: an old pen, a glasses case, a little pamphlet, or some other personal token. Benjamin felt greatly consoled.",CO150CL12
12590,25,"He informed them that he intended to keep the study exactly as it was. He hadn’t even opened the desk yet. He did so then, and, with the others, drew up a list of the contents of some of the drawers. There were letters, loose papers, concert programs, menus from grand dinners; all of it in an enormous muddle. Among other things they found some notebooks, numbered and dated.",CO150CL12
12591,26,“A diary!” exclaimed Benjamin.,CO150CL12
12592,27,"It was indeed a diary of the deceased’s thoughts and impressions, a sort of collection of secret memories and confidences that the man had shared only with himself. The friends were greatly moved and excited; reading them would be just like conversing with Joaquim again. Such an upright character! And the soul of discretion! Benjamin began reading, but his voice broke, and João Brás had to carry on.",CO150CL12
12593,28,"Their interest in what they heard soothed the pain of death. It was a book worthy of being published. It was filled with political and social observations, philosophical reflections, anecdotes about public men such as Feijó and Vasconcelos, others of a rather racier nature, the names of ladies, among them Leocádia’s; an entire repertoire of events and comments. They all admired the dead man’s talent, his graceful style, and the fascinating subject matter. Some were in favor of having it printed; Benjamin agreed, on condition that they excluded any elements that might be unsavory or excessively personal.",CO150CL12
12594,29,"And they continued reading, skipping whole sections and pages, until the clock struck noon. They all stood up. Diogo Vilares had been due at his office hours ago; João Brás and Elias also had to be elsewhere. Galdino went off to his shop. Fragoso had to change out of his black clothes and take his wife shopping on Rua do Ouvidor. They agreed to meet again and continue their reading. Some of the details had given them an itch for scandal, and itches need to be scratched, which is precisely what they intended to do, by reading.",CO150CL12

12596,31,"“Yes, until tomorrow.”",CO150CL12
12597,32,"Once he was alone, Benjamin carried on reading the manuscript. Among other things, he marveled at the portrayal of the Widow Leocádia, a masterpiece of painstaking observation, even though the date coincided with the time when they were still lovers. It was proof of a rare impartiality. The deceased, it turned out, was a master of portraits. The notebooks were full of them, stretching back to 1873 or 1874; some were sketches of the living, others of the dead, some were of public men like Paula Sousa, Aureliano, Olinda, etc. They were brief and to the point, sometimes only three or four lines, drawn with such confident fidelity and perfection that the image seemed almost like a photograph. Benjamin carried on reading. Suddenly he came across Diogo Vilares, about whom he read the following:",CO150CL12
12598,33,"DIOGO VILARES—I have referred to this friend many times and will do so yet again, provided he doesn’t kill me with boredom, a field in which I consider him a true professional. Many years ago, he asked me to get him a job and I did. He did not warn me of the currency in which he would repay me. Such singular gratitude! He went so far as to compose a sonnet and publish it. He wouldn’t stop talking about the favor I’d done him, paying me endless compliments; finally, though, he relented. Later on, we became more closely acquainted. I got to know him even better.",CO150CL12
12599,34,"C’est le genre ennuyeux. Not a bad partner at ombre, though. They tell me he owes nothing to anyone. A good family man. Stupid and credulous. Within the space of four days, I’ve heard him describe a government as both excellent and detestable, depending on who he is speaking to. He laughs a lot and usually inappropriately. When they meet him for the first time, everyone begins by assuming he is a serious fellow; by the second day, they snap their fingers at him. The reason is his face, or, more particularly, his cheeks, which lend him a certain air of superiority.",CO150CL12
12600,35,"Benjamin’s first reaction was that he’d had a lucky escape. What if Diogo Vilares had been there? He reread the description and could scarcely believe it. But there was no denying it: the name was definitely Diogo Vilares and it was written in his uncle’s own hand. And he wasn’t the only friend mentioned, either; he flicked through the manuscript and came across Elias:",CO150CL12
12601,36,"ELIAS XAVIER—This Elias is a subordinate fellow, destined to serve someone, and serve him smugly, like a coachman to a fashionable household. He vulgarly treats my personal visits with a certain arrogance and disdain: the policy of an ambitious lackey. From the first weeks I knew him, I realized that he wanted to make himself my intimate friend, and I also understood that on the day he really became one, he would throw all the others out in the street.",CO150CL12
12602,37,"There are times when he calls me to one side to talk to me secretly about the weather. His aim is clearly to instill in the others a suspicion that there are private matters between us, and he achieves precisely this, because all the others bow and scrape before him. He is intelligent, good-humored, and refined. He’s an excellent conversationalist. I don’t know anyone with a sharper intellect. He is neither cowardly nor slanderous. He only speaks ill of someone when his own interests are at stake; when such interests are absent, he holds his tongue, whereas true slander is gratuitous. He is dedicated and persuasive.",CO150CL12
12603,38,"He has no ideas, it’s true, but that’s the difference between him and Diogo Vilares: Diogo simply parrots the ideas he hears, whereas Elias knows how to make them his own and choose the opportune moment to introduce them into the conversation. An event in 1865 provides a good illustration of the man’s shrewdness. He was due to be granted a knighthood by the government for providing some freed slaves for the war in Paraguay. He had no need of me, but he came to see me on two or three occasions, with a dismayed and pleading air, to ask me to intercede on his behalf. I spoke to the minister, who told me: “Elias knows the document has already been drafted and only awaits the Emperor’s signature.” I understood then that this was simply a way of showing how deeply indebted he was to me. A good partner at whist; a touch quarrelsome, but he knows what he’s doing.",CO150CL12
12604,39,"“Well, really, Uncle Joaquim!” exclaimed Benjamin, getting to his feet. A few moments later, he thought to himself: “Here I am reading the unpublished book of his heart. I only knew the public edition, revised and expurgated. This is the original, internal text, exact and authentic. But who would have thought it of Uncle Joaquim!”",CO150CL12
12605,40,"He sat down again, slowly reread the portrait of Elias, pondering its features. While he lacked the necessary knowledge to evaluate the truth of the sketch, he thought that, in many aspects, at least, the portrait was a true likeness. He compared these iconographic notes, so crude and cold, with his uncle’s warm, elegant manners, and felt gripped by a certain fear and disquiet. What, for example, might his uncle have said about him?",CO150CL12
12606,41,"With this thought, he again leafed through the manuscript, skimming over various ladies and public men, and came upon Fragoso—an extremely brief sketch that came immediately after Galdino and four pages before João Brás. He remembered that the former had, only a short time before, taken a pen as a memento; perhaps the very pen with which the dead man had drawn his portrait. The sketch was only a few lines long, as follows:",CO150CL12
12607,42,"FRAGOSO—Honest, saccharine manners, and handsome. Wasn’t difficult to marry him off; he gets on very well with his wife. I know he adores me—almost as much as he adores himself. Polished, insipid, and commonplace conversation.",CO150CL12
12608,43,"GALDINO MADEIRA—The warmest heart in the world and a spotless character, but the qualities of his mind destroy all the others. I lent him some money for family reasons and because money is not something I lack. There is in his brain a hole of some sort, through which his mind slips and falls into a vacuum. He is incapable of three minutes’ consecutive thought. He subsists mainly on images and borrowed phrases. The “teeth of calumny” and other such expressions are his perennial delight—as worn out as the mattress in a cheap boardinghouse.",CO150CL12
12609,44,"He is easily vexed at cards, and, once vexed, makes a point of losing, making it clear that this was deliberate. He doesn’t dismiss any employees, however bad. If he didn’t have bookkeepers, it’s doubtful he could keep track of his earnings at all. A friend of mine, who is a civil servant, owed him some money for more than two years and used to say to me with a grin that, whenever Galdino saw him in the street, instead of asking for his money, he would ask him how things were going at the ministry.",CO150CL12

He reread what his uncle had written: it was rather scant and thin, but not slanderous.

Alone, however, he had to bear it with no contrasting light and shade.

He tried to banish this image from his mind, but it refused to budge. Unable to drive it away, Benjamin tried mentally to close the man’s eyes and straighten his mouth; but no sooner had he done so than the eyelids would lift once again, and the lips resume that ironic sneer.

12621,3,"THE DEATH OF Joaquim Fidélis caused indescribable consternation throughout the suburb of Engenho Velho, and particularly in the hearts of his dearest friends. It was so unexpected. He was in fine fettle, had an iron constitution, and, the very night before he passed away, had been attending a ball where he had been seen happily chatting away. He had even danced, at the request of a lady in her sixties, the widow of a friend of his, who took him by the arm and said:",CO150CL10

12623,5,"Joaquim Fidélis protested with a smile, but did as he was told and danced. It was two o’clock in the morning when he left, wrapping his sixty years in a warm winter cape (for it was June 1879), covering his bald head with the hood, lighting a cigar, and hopping nimbly into his carriage.",CO150CL10
12624,6,"He may well have nodded off in the carriage, but, once home, despite the late hour and his heavy eyelids, he went to his desk, opened a drawer, took out one of many notebooks, and, in three or four minutes, wrote some ten or eleven lines. His last words were these: “Altogether a vile ball; some aging reveler forced me to dance a quadrille with her; at the door, a dark-skinned country bumpkin asked me for a present. Simply vile!” He put the notebook back in the drawer, undressed, got into bed, fell asleep, and died.",CO150CL10
12625,7,"Yes, indeed, the news dismayed the whole neighborhood. So beloved was he, with his fine manners and his ability to be able to talk to anyone; he could be educated with the educated, ignorant with the ignorant, boyish with the boys, even girlish with the girls. And then, most obligingly, he was always ready to write letters, speak to friends, patch up quarrels, or lend money. In the evenings, a handful of close acquaintances from Engenho Velho, and sometimes other parts of the city, would gather in his house to play ombre or whist and discuss politics. Joaquim Fidélis had been a member of the Chamber of Deputies until its dissolution by the Marquis of Olinda in 1863.",CO150CL10
12626,8,"Unable to get reelected, he abandoned public life. He was a conservative, a label he had difficulty in accepting because it sounded to him like a political Gallicism. He preferred to be called one of the “Saquarema Set.” But he gave it all up, and it seems that, in recent times, he detached himself first from the party, and, eventually, from the party’s politics. There are reasons to believe that, from a certain point onward, he was merely a profound skeptic.",CO150CL10
12627,9,"He was a wealthy and educated man. He had qualified as a lawyer in 1842. Now he did nothing, but read a great deal. There were no women in his house. Widowed after the first outbreak of yellow fever, he refused to countenance a second marriage, to the great sorrow of three or four ladies, who for some time had hopes in that regard. One of them perfidiously managed to make her beautiful 1845 ringlets last until well after her second grandchild was born; another younger woman, also a widow, thought she could hold on to him with concessions that were as generous as they were irretrievable.",CO150CL10
12628,10,"“My dear Leocádia,” he would say whenever she hinted at a marital solution, “why don’t we carry on just as we are? Mystery is what gives life its charm.” He lived with a nephew called Benjamin, the orphaned son of one of his sisters who had died when the child was still very young. Joaquim Fidélis brought him up and made him study hard, so much so that the boy graduated with a law degree in the year of 1877.",CO150CL10
12629,11,"Benjamin was utterly dumbfounded. He could not bring himself to believe that his uncle was dead. He rushed to his bedroom, found the corpse lying in bed, cold, eyes wide open, and a faintly ironic curl to the left-hand corner of his mouth. He wept profusely. He was losing not just a relative but a father, a tenderhearted, dedicated father, one of a kind. Finally, Benjamin wiped away his tears and, since it upset him to see the dead man’s eyes open and his lip curled, he rectified both defects. Thus death took on a more tragic but less original expression.",CO150CL10
12630,12,"“No! I don’t believe it!” cried Diogo Vilares, one of the neighbors, shortly after hearing the news.",CO150CL10
12631,13,"Diogo Vilares was one of Joaquim Fidélis’s five closest friends. He owed to him the job he had held since 1857. Diogo was followed by the four others in quick succession, all speechless and unable to believe what had happened. The first was Elias Xavier, who had obtained a knighthood, thanks, it was said, to the deceased’s timely intervention; then came João Brás, another deputy who, under the rather peculiar rules of the time, had been elected to the Chamber thanks to Joaquim Fidélis’s influence.",CO150CL10
12632,14,"Last of all came Fragoso and Galdino, who, in lieu of diplomas, knighthoods, or jobs, owed him other favors instead. Fidélis had advanced Galdino a small amount of capital, and had arranged a good marriage for Fragoso. And now he was dead! Gone forever! Standing around the bed, they gazed at his serene face and recalled their last get-together the previous Sunday, so intimate and yet so jolly! And, even more recently, the night before last, when their customary game of ombre had lasted until eleven o’clock.",CO150CL10
12633,15,"“Don’t come tomorrow,” Joaquim Fidélis had said to them. “I’m going to Carvalhinho’s ball.”",CO150CL10

12637,19,"Many persons of note came to the funeral: two senators, a former minister, a few noblemen, wealthy businessmen, lawyers, merchants, and doctors; but the coffin was carried by Benjamin and those five close friends. None of them would yield this honor to anyone, considering it their final and inalienable duty.",CO150CL10
12638,20,"The graveside eulogy was given by João Brás; it was a touching address, slightly too polished for such an unexpected event, but nonetheless excusable. When everyone had deposited their shovelful of earth on the coffin, the mourners slowly slipped away from the graveside, apart from those six, who stayed to oversee the gravediggers as they went indifferently about their work. They stayed there until the grave had been filled to the very top and the funeral wreaths laid out upon it.",CO150CL10

12641,23,"“I hope that Uncle Joaquim’s friends will also be my friends,” he said.",CO150CL10
12642,24,"They went in and, while they ate, they talked about the dead man, each one recounting some story, some witty remark; they were unanimous in their praise and fond regrets. Since each of them had asked for a little memento of the deceased, when they finished breakfast they all went through into his study and chose something: an old pen, a glasses case, a little pamphlet, or some other personal token. Benjamin felt greatly consoled.",CO150CL10
12643,25,"He informed them that he intended to keep the study exactly as it was. He hadn’t even opened the desk yet. He did so then, and, with the others, drew up a list of the contents of some of the drawers. There were letters, loose papers, concert programs, menus from grand dinners; all of it in an enormous muddle. Among other things they found some notebooks, numbered and dated.",CO150CL10
12644,26,“A diary!” exclaimed Benjamin.,CO150CL10
12645,27,"It was indeed a diary of the deceased’s thoughts and impressions, a sort of collection of secret memories and confidences that the man had shared only with himself. The friends were greatly moved and excited; reading them would be just like conversing with Joaquim again. Such an upright character! And the soul of discretion! Benjamin began reading, but his voice broke, and João Brás had to carry on.",CO150CL10
12646,28,"Their interest in what they heard soothed the pain of death. It was a book worthy of being published. It was filled with political and social observations, philosophical reflections, anecdotes about public men such as Feijó and Vasconcelos, others of a rather racier nature, the names of ladies, among them Leocádia’s; an entire repertoire of events and comments. They all admired the dead man’s talent, his graceful style, and the fascinating subject matter. Some were in favor of having it printed; Benjamin agreed, on condition that they excluded any elements that might be unsavory or excessively personal.",CO150CL10
12647,29,"And they continued reading, skipping whole sections and pages, until the clock struck noon. They all stood up. Diogo Vilares had been due at his office hours ago; João Brás and Elias also had to be elsewhere. Galdino went off to his shop. Fragoso had to change out of his black clothes and take his wife shopping on Rua do Ouvidor. They agreed to meet again and continue their reading. Some of the details had given them an itch for scandal, and itches need to be scratched, which is precisely what they intended to do, by reading.",CO150CL10

12649,31,"“Yes, until tomorrow.”",CO150CL10
12650,32,"Once he was alone, Benjamin carried on reading the manuscript. Among other things, he marveled at the portrayal of the Widow Leocádia, a masterpiece of painstaking observation, even though the date coincided with the time when they were still lovers. It was proof of a rare impartiality. The deceased, it turned out, was a master of portraits. The notebooks were full of them, stretching back to 1873 or 1874; some were sketches of the living, others of the dead, some were of public men like Paula Sousa, Aureliano, Olinda, etc. They were brief and to the point, sometimes only three or four lines, drawn with such confident fidelity and perfection that the image seemed almost like a photograph. Benjamin carried on reading. Suddenly he came across Diogo Vilares, about whom he read the following:",CO150CL10
12651,33,"DIOGO VILARES—I have referred to this friend many times and will do so yet again, provided he doesn’t kill me with boredom, a field in which I consider him a true professional. Many years ago, he asked me to get him a job and I did. He did not warn me of the currency in which he would repay me. Such singular gratitude! He went so far as to compose a sonnet and publish it. He wouldn’t stop talking about the favor I’d done him, paying me endless compliments; finally, though, he relented. Later on, we became more closely acquainted. I got to know him even better.",CO150CL10
12652,34,"C’est le genre ennuyeux. Not a bad partner at ombre, though. They tell me he owes nothing to anyone. A good family man. Stupid and credulous. Within the space of four days, I’ve heard him describe a government as both excellent and detestable, depending on who he is speaking to. He laughs a lot and usually inappropriately. When they meet him for the first time, everyone begins by assuming he is a serious fellow; by the second day, they snap their fingers at him. The reason is his face, or, more particularly, his cheeks, which lend him a certain air of superiority.",CO150CL10
12653,35,"Benjamin’s first reaction was that he’d had a lucky escape. What if Diogo Vilares had been there? He reread the description and could scarcely believe it. But there was no denying it: the name was definitely Diogo Vilares and it was written in his uncle’s own hand. And he wasn’t the only friend mentioned, either; he flicked through the manuscript and came across Elias:",CO150CL10
12654,36,"ELIAS XAVIER—This Elias is a subordinate fellow, destined to serve someone, and serve him smugly, like a coachman to a fashionable household. He vulgarly treats my personal visits with a certain arrogance and disdain: the policy of an ambitious lackey. From the first weeks I knew him, I realized that he wanted to make himself my intimate friend, and I also understood that on the day he really became one, he would throw all the others out in the street.",CO150CL10
12655,37,"There are times when he calls me to one side to talk to me secretly about the weather. His aim is clearly to instill in the others a suspicion that there are private matters between us, and he achieves precisely this, because all the others bow and scrape before him. He is intelligent, good-humored, and refined. He’s an excellent conversationalist. I don’t know anyone with a sharper intellect. He is neither cowardly nor slanderous. He only speaks ill of someone when his own interests are at stake; when such interests are absent, he holds his tongue, whereas true slander is gratuitous. He is dedicated and persuasive.",CO150CL10
12656,38,"He has no ideas, it’s true, but that’s the difference between him and Diogo Vilares: Diogo simply parrots the ideas he hears, whereas Elias knows how to make them his own and choose the opportune moment to introduce them into the conversation. An event in 1865 provides a good illustration of the man’s shrewdness. He was due to be granted a knighthood by the government for providing some freed slaves for the war in Paraguay. He had no need of me, but he came to see me on two or three occasions, with a dismayed and pleading air, to ask me to intercede on his behalf. I spoke to the minister, who told me: “Elias knows the document has already been drafted and only awaits the Emperor’s signature.” I understood then that this was simply a way of showing how deeply indebted he was to me. A good partner at whist; a touch quarrelsome, but he knows what he’s doing.",CO150CL10
12657,39,"“Well, really, Uncle Joaquim!” exclaimed Benjamin, getting to his feet. A few moments later, he thought to himself: “Here I am reading the unpublished book of his heart. I only knew the public edition, revised and expurgated. This is the original, internal text, exact and authentic. But who would have thought it of Uncle Joaquim!”",CO150CL10
12658,40,"He sat down again, slowly reread the portrait of Elias, pondering its features. While he lacked the necessary knowledge to evaluate the truth of the sketch, he thought that, in many aspects, at least, the portrait was a true likeness. He compared these iconographic notes, so crude and cold, with his uncle’s warm, elegant manners, and felt gripped by a certain fear and disquiet. What, for example, might his uncle have said about him?",CO150CL10
12659,41,"With this thought, he again leafed through the manuscript, skimming over various ladies and public men, and came upon Fragoso—an extremely brief sketch that came immediately after Galdino and four pages before João Brás. He remembered that the former had, only a short time before, taken a pen as a memento; perhaps the very pen with which the dead man had drawn his portrait. The sketch was only a few lines long, as follows:",CO150CL10
12660,42,"FRAGOSO—Honest, saccharine manners, and handsome. Wasn’t difficult to marry him off; he gets on very well with his wife. I know he adores me—almost as much as he adores himself. Polished, insipid, and commonplace conversation.",CO150CL10
12661,43,"GALDINO MADEIRA—The warmest heart in the world and a spotless character, but the qualities of his mind destroy all the others. I lent him some money for family reasons and because money is not something I lack. There is in his brain a hole of some sort, through which his mind slips and falls into a vacuum. He is incapable of three minutes’ consecutive thought. He subsists mainly on images and borrowed phrases. The “teeth of calumny” and other such expressions are his perennial delight—as worn out as the mattress in a cheap boardinghouse.",CO150CL10
12662,44,"He is easily vexed at cards, and, once vexed, makes a point of losing, making it clear that this was deliberate. He doesn’t dismiss any employees, however bad. If he didn’t have bookkeepers, it’s doubtful he could keep track of his earnings at all. A friend of mine, who is a civil servant, owed him some money for more than two years and used to say to me with a grin that, whenever Galdino saw him in the street, instead of asking for his money, he would ask him how things were going at the ministry.",CO150CL10

12674,3,"I was walking down a street at the beginning of last month—he said—when a cab came careering past and almost knocked me over. I escaped by jumping into the doorway of a junk shop. Neither the clatter of horse and cab nor my sudden irruption into his shop roused the owner, who was in the back, dozing in a folding chair. He was a ruin of a man, with a grubby, straw-colored beard and, on his head, a tattered cap that had doubtless failed to find a buyer. He appeared to be a man without a past, unlike some of the objects he was selling, and yet he did not exude the air of austere, embittered sadness you might expect of a man who did once have a life.",CO199CL12
12675,4,"The shop was dark and crammed with the bent, broken, grimy, rusty objects one usually finds in such places, and all in the state of semi-disorder one would expect. However banal, though, this motley collection of detritus was not without interest.",CO199CL12
12676,5,"Filling the area around the shop door were pots without lids, lids without pots, buttons, shoes, locks, a black skirt, straw hats and fur hats, picture frames, a pair of binoculars, tailcoats, a fencing foil, a stuffed dog, slippers, gloves, various nondescript vases, some epaulets, a velvet bag, two coat racks, a catapult, a thermometer, some chairs, a lithograph of a portrait by Sisson, a backgammon set, two wire masks for some future carnival, as well as other things I either didn’t even see or have forgotten, all leaning or hanging or on display in equally ancient glass cases. Farther in there was still more shabby merchandise, mostly larger pieces of furniture, dressers and chairs and beds piled one on top of the other, lost in the gloom.",CO199CL12
12677,6,"I was just about to leave when I spotted a cage hanging in the doorway. Like everything else, it was very old, and, in keeping with the general desolation, it should really have been empty, but it wasn’t. A canary was hopping about inside. The little creature’s color, animation, and grace lent a touch of life and youth to the surrounding junk. He was the last surviving passenger from a shipwreck, washed up on that shore, happy and unscathed.",CO199CL12
12678,7,"As soon as I saw him, he began to jump from perch to perch, as if to say that in the midst of that cemetery there was at least one ray of sunlight. I do not attribute that image to the canary, and I use it only because I am speaking now to rhetorically minded people; as he told me later on, he knew nothing of either cemeteries or sunlight.

Neither the clatter of horse and cab nor my sudden irruption into his shop roused the owner, who was in the back, dozing in a folding chair. He was a ruin of a man, with a grubby, straw-colored beard and, on his head, a tattered cap that had doubtless failed to find a buyer. He appeared to be a man without a past, unlike some of the objects he was selling, and yet he did not exude the air of austere, embittered sadness you might expect of a man who did once have a life.",CO199CL10

Like everything else, it was very old, and, in keeping with the general desolation, it should really have been empty, but it wasn’t. A canary was hopping about inside.

12916,53,"“The same mad man? Do you think he’s right, ma’am?”",CO013CL11
12917,54,"“I think, if I don’t offend you…”",CO013CL11
12918,55,"“What offense! If I even feel honored with it; I’m a harmless mad man, that’s true. But the truth is that you’re happy like a few. How many months have you been married?”",CO013CL11
12919,56,"“Three months this Sunday,” replied Adelaide.",CO013CL11
12920,57,"“I said minutes ago it seemed like three minutes,” Azevedo added.",CO013CL11
12921,58,Tito looked at both of them and said with a smile:,CO013CL11
12922,59,"“Three months, three minutes! This is the whole truth of life. If they were placed on a grate, like St. Lawrence, five minutes were five months. And we still talk about time! Is there time! Time is in our impressions. There are months for the unfortunate and minutes for the fortunate ones!”",CO013CL11
12923,60,“What a fortune!” exclaims Azevedo.,CO013CL11
12924,61,"“Not complete? Imagination! Husband of a seraph, in the graces and in the heart, I didn’t notice that it was here… but there’s no need to blush!… Of this you’ll hear me twenty times a day; what I think, I say. How our friends will envy you!”",CO013CL11
12925,62,“That I don’t know.”,CO013CL11
12926,63,"“Why! Tucked in this attic of the world, you can know nothing. And you do well. This thing of being happy in the eyes of all is to share happiness. Well, to respect the principle, I must go right now…”",CO013CL11
12927,64,"Saying this, Tito stood up.",CO013CL11
12928,65,“Don’t be like that: stay with us.”,CO013CL11
12929,66,"“True friends are also happiness,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL11
12930,67,“Ah!”,CO013CL11
12931,68,"“It’s good that you learn at our school the science of marriage,” Azevedo added.",CO013CL11
12932,69,"“For what?” asked Tito, wagging his little whip.",CO013CL11
12933,70,“For you to get married.”,CO013CL11
12934,71,“Humph!…” Tito went.,CO013CL11
12935,72,“You don’t intend?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL11
12936,73,“Are you still the same as in other times?”,CO013CL11
12937,74,"“The same,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
12938,75,Adelaide made a gesture of curiosity and asked:,CO013CL11
12939,76,“Are you horrified by marriage?”,CO013CL11
12940,77,"“I have no vocation,” replied Tito. “It’s purely a case of vocation. Whoever doesn’t have it, don’t get involved in this, which is to waste time and peace. For a long time I have been convinced of this.”",CO013CL11
12941,78,“The time hasn’t come for you.”,CO013CL11
12942,79,"“And it’s not here,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
12943,80,"“But if I remember correctly,” said Azevedo, offering him a cigar, “there was a day when you ran away from the usual theories: you were then in love…”",CO013CL11
12944,81,"“In love, it’s a mistake. There was a day when Providence brought a confirmation to my solitary instincts. I started to have interests in a lady…”",CO013CL11
12945,82,"“It’s true, it was a funny affair.”",CO013CL11
12946,83,“How was the affair?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL11
12947,84,"“Tito saw a young lady at a ball. The next day he shows up at her house and, without further ado, asks her for her hand. She answered… what did she answer to you?”",CO013CL11
12948,85,"“She replied in writing that I was a fool and I should leave it alone. She didn’t say positively foolish, but it was all the same. It must be confessed that such an answer was not proper. I took it back and never loved again.”",CO013CL11
12949,86,“But did you love then?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL11
12950,87,"“I don’t know if it was love,” said Tito, “it was a thing… But look, this was a good five years ago. Since then no one else made my heart beat.”",CO013CL11
12951,88,“Worse for you.”,CO013CL11
12952,89,"“I know!” Tito said with a shrug. “If I don’t have the intimate joys of love, I have neither the displeasures nor the disappointments. And that’s already a great fortune!”",CO013CL11
12953,90,"“In true love there is none of that,” Azevedo’s wife said sententiously.",CO013CL11
12954,91,"“There isn’t? Let’s leave the matter; I could give a speech on that purpose, but I’d rather…”",CO013CL11
12955,92,"“You’re staying with us,” Azevedo cut him off. “That’s settled.”",CO013CL11
12956,93,“I don’t intend to.”,CO013CL11
12957,94,“But I do. You’re staying.”,CO013CL11
12958,95,“But if I have already sent the servant to take lodging in the hotel of Bragança…”,CO013CL11
12959,96,"“Well, send a counter-order. You’re staying with me.”",CO013CL11
12960,97,“I insist on not disturbing your peace.”,CO013CL11
12961,98,“Forget about it.”,CO013CL11
12962,99,“Stay!” said Adelaide.,CO013CL11
12963,100,“I’ll stay.”,CO013CL11
12964,101,"“And tomorrow,” continued Adelaide, “after you have rested, you must tell us the secret of the exemption you so much boast about.”",CO013CL11
12965,102,"“There’s no secret,” said Tito. “This is what it is: between a love that offers itself and… a game of voltarete, I don’t hesitate, I throw myself to the voltarete. By the way, Ernesto, do you know that I met a famous voltarete partner in Chile? He made the most reckless casca I’ve ever seen… you know what a casca is, ma’am?”",CO013CL11
12966,103,"“No,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL11
12967,104,"“Well, I’ll explain.”",CO013CL11
12968,105,Azevedo looked outside and said:,CO013CL11
12969,106,“Here comes Mrs. Emília.”,CO013CL11
12970,107,"In fact, at the garden gate stood a lady arm-in-arm with an old man in his fifties.",CO013CL11
12971,108,Mrs. Emília was a young lady who could be called a beautiful woman; she was tall in height and haughty in character. The love she could infuse would be by imposition. In her manners and her graces she inspired a certain notion of a queen that would make you want to take her to a throne.,CO013CL11
12972,109,"She wore elegance and simplicity. She had this natural elegance which is another elegance, different from the elegance of the embellishments, about which I have already had occasion to write this maxim: “That there are elegant people, and adorned people.”",CO013CL11
12973,110,"Black and slanted eyes, full of light and grandeur, abundant brown hair, straight Sapphic nose,10 thin red lips, satin face, lap and arms like those of the statues, such were the features of Emília’s beauty.",CO013CL11
12974,111,"As for the old man who gave her his arm, he was, as I said, a man in his fifties. He was what is crudely called in Portuguese – an old dandy. Made-up, corseted, one saw in him something like a ruin of the past rebuilt by modern hands, so as to have this cross-bred aspect which is neither the austerity of old age nor the freshness of youth. There was no doubt that the old man must have been a handsome young man in his day; but presently, if he had made any achievements, he could be only content with the memory of them.",CO013CL11
12975,112,When Emília entered the garden everyone had already stood. The newcomer shook hands with Azevedo and went to kiss Adelaide. She was going to sit in the chair Azevedo had offered her when she noticed Tito standing beside him.,CO013CL11
12976,113,"The two greeted each other, but with a different air. Tito looked calm and coolly polite; but Emília, after greeting him, kept her eyes fixed on him, as if she were evoking a memory from the past.",CO013CL11
12977,114,"When the necessary presentations were made, and to Diogo Franco (the name of the strong-armed man), they all took seats.",CO013CL11
12978,115,The first one that spoke was Emília:,CO013CL11
12979,116,“I wouldn’t have come today if it were not for Mr. Diogo’s obsequiousness.”,CO013CL11
12980,117,Adelaide looked at the old man and said:,CO013CL11
12981,118,“Mr. Diogo is a marvel.”,CO013CL11
12982,119,Diogo straightened up and murmured with a certain tone of modesty:,CO013CL11
12983,120,"“Not so much, not so much.”",CO013CL11
12984,121,"“Yes, yes,” Emília said. “He’s perhaps not one, but two marvels. Ah! You know he’s going to present me a gift?”",CO013CL11
12985,122,“A gift!” exclaimed Azevedo.,CO013CL11
12986,123,"“It’s true,” continued Emília, “a gift sent from Europe and beyond; memories of his adolescent travel…”",CO013CL11
12987,124,Diogo was beaming.,CO013CL11
12988,125,"“It’s insignificant,” he said, looking at Emília.",CO013CL11
12989,126,“But what is it?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL11
12990,127,“Yeah… guess what? It’s a white bear!”,CO013CL11
12991,128,“A white bear!”,CO013CL11
12992,129,“Really?”,CO013CL11
12993,130,"“It’s about to arrive, but it was only yesterday that I heard from him. What a lovely present!”",CO013CL11
12994,131,“A bear!” Azevedo exclaimed again.,CO013CL11
12995,132,"Tito bent to his friend’s ear, and said quietly:",CO013CL11
12996,133,“With him they’ll be two.”,CO013CL11
12997,134,"Diogo, rejoiced at the effect that the news of the present caused, but, deluded in the character of this effect, said:",CO013CL11
12998,135,“It’s worth nothing. It’s a bear I’ve ordered; it’s true that I asked for the most beautiful one. They don’t know what a white bear is. Imagine that it’s all white.”,CO013CL11
12999,136,“Ah!” said Tito.,CO013CL11
13000,137,“It’s an admirable animal!” said Diogo.,CO013CL11
13001,138,"“I think so,” said Tito. “Now imagine what won’t be a white bear that is all white. What does this guy do?” he immediately asked Azevedo.",CO013CL11
13002,139,“He’s dating Emília; he has fifty contos.11,CO013CL11
13003,140,“And her?”,CO013CL11
13004,141,“Doesn’t care about him.”,CO013CL11
13005,142,“She says?”,CO013CL11
13006,143,“And it’s true.”,CO013CL11
13007,144,"As they exchanged these words, Diogo toyed with the signets of his watch and the two ladies talked. After the last words between Azevedo and Tito, Emília turned to Adelaide’s husband and asked:",CO013CL11
13008,145,"“What’s this, Mr. Azevedo? So you celebrate a birthday in this house and you don’t invite me?”",CO013CL11
13009,146,“But what about the rain?” said Adelaide.,CO013CL11
13010,147,“Ingrate! You know there is no rain in such cases.”,CO013CL11
13011,148,"“Besides,” added Azevedo, “the party was organized so modestly.”",CO013CL11
13012,149,"“One way or the other, I’m family.”",CO013CL11
13013,150,"“The honeymoon is still going on even after five months,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
13014,151,"“Here you come with your epigrams,” said Azevedo.",CO013CL11
13015,152,"“Ah! This is bad, Mr. Tito!”",CO013CL11
13016,153,“Tito?” Emília asked Adelaide in a low voice.,CO013CL11
13017,154,“Yes.”,CO013CL11
13018,155,"“Mrs. Emília doesn’t know yet who our friend Tito is,” said Azevedo. “I’m even afraid of telling you.”",CO013CL11
13019,156,"“So, is it so bad what you have to tell?”",CO013CL11
13020,157,"“Perhaps,” Tito said indifferently.",CO013CL11
13021,158,“Very ugly!” exclaimed Adelaide.,CO013CL11
13022,159,“What is it then?” asked Emília.,CO013CL11
13023,160,"“He’s a man who cannot love,” Adelaide continued. “There can be no greater indifference to love… In short, what do you prefer to a love… what? a voltarete.”",CO013CL11
13024,161,“He told you that?” asked Emília.,CO013CL11
13025,162,"“And I repeat,” said Tito. “But notice, it’s not for them, it’s for me. I believe that all women are believers in my worship; but it’s I who am made in such a way that I can give them nothing more than disinterested esteem.”",CO013CL11
13026,163,Emília looked at the young man and said:,CO013CL11
13027,164,"“If it’s not vanity, it’s a disease.”",CO013CL11
13028,165,"“You will forgive me, but I believe it’s neither disease nor vanity; it’s nature: some loathe oranges, others loathe love; now if the loathing comes because of the peels, I don’t know; what is certain is that it’s so.",CO013CL11
13029,166,"“It’s feral!” said Emília, looking at Adelaide.",CO013CL11
13030,167,"“Feral, I?” said Tito, standing up. “I am silky, a lady, a miracle of gentleness… It really hurts me that I cannot be in the line of other men and I’m not, like everyone else, prone to receive the amorous impressions, but what do you want? It’s not my fault.”",CO013CL11
13031,168,"“Come on,” said Azevedo, “time will change you.”",CO013CL11
13032,169,“But when? I’m already twenty-nine years old.”,CO013CL11
13033,170,“Already twenty-nine?” asked Emília.,CO013CL11
13034,171,“Last Easter.”,CO013CL11
13035,172,“It doesn’t show.”,CO013CL11
13036,173,“It’s your good eyes.”,CO013CL11
13037,174,"The conversation went on this way, until dinner was announced. Emília and Diogo had dined, and only stayed to keep company to the Azevedos and Tito, who had declared from the beginning to be starving.",CO013CL11
13038,175,The conversation over dinner dealt with indifferent things.,CO013CL11
13039,176,"When coffee was being served, a servant of the hotel where Diogo lived was at the door; bringing him a letter, with an indication on the envelope that it was urgent. Diogo received the letter, read it, and seemed to change color. Yet he continued to take part in the general conversation. That circumstance, however, gave rise to Adelaide asking Emília:",CO013CL11
13040,177,“When will this eternal boyfriend leave you?”,CO013CL11
13041,178,"“And do I know!” replied Emília. “But after all, he’s not a bad man! He has this craze to tell me at the end of every week how he nurtures an ardent passion for me.”",CO013CL11
13042,179,"“Well, if it’s nothing more than a weekly statement.”",CO013CL11
13043,180,"“It’s not. He has the advantage of being an infallible strong-arm for the street and a less repetitious bore in the house. He already told me some fifty times about the love battles in which he entered. All he desires is to accompany me on a trip around the globe. When he tells me this, if it’s evening, and it’s almost always at night, I order tea, an excellent means of appeasing his amorous ardor. He enjoys tea like mad. He likes it as much as he likes me! But the thing with the white bear? And if he really sent for a bear?”",CO013CL11
13044,181,“Accept it.”,CO013CL11
13045,182,“But I’ll have to provide for a bear? That’s all I needed!”,CO013CL11
13046,183,Adelaide smiled and said:,CO013CL11
13047,184,“It seems to me that you end up falling in love…”,CO013CL11
13048,185,“With whom? With the bear?”,CO013CL11
13049,186,"“No, with Diogo.”",CO013CL11
13050,187,"At this moment they were both near a window. Tito was talking on the couch with Azevedo. Diogo reflected deeply, stretched out in an armchair.",CO013CL11
13051,188,"Emília had her eyes on Tito. After a silence, she said to Adelaide:",CO013CL11
13052,189,“What do you think of this friend of your husband? He seems to be presumptuous. Never fell in love! Is it believable?”,CO013CL11
13053,190,“Maybe it’s true.”,CO013CL11
13054,191,“I don’t believe it. You’re like a child! He says that as lip service…”,CO013CL11
13055,192,“It’s true that I don’t know him well…”,CO013CL11
13056,193,"“As for me, it seemed to me that that face was not strange… but I don’t remember!”",CO013CL11
13057,194,“He seems to be sincere… but to say that is already audacious.”,CO013CL11
13058,195,“That’s clear…”,CO013CL11
13059,196,“What are you laughing at?,CO013CL11
13060,197,"“It reminds me of one of his same types,” said Emília. “It was a long time ago. He always bragged about his exemption. He said that all women were for him vases from China: he admired them and nothing else. Poor thing! Fell in less than a month. Adelaide, I saw him kiss the tip of my shoes… after which I despised him.”",CO013CL11
13061,198,“What have you done?”,CO013CL11
13062,199,“Ah! I don’t know what I did. Saint Cunning was the one who pulled off the miracle. I avenged the sex and took down a proud man.”,CO013CL11
13063,200,“Well done!”,CO013CL11
13064,201,“It was no less than this one. But let’s talk about serious things… I got the French fashion magazines…”,CO013CL11
13065,202,“What’s new?”,CO013CL11
13066,203,“A lot of things. I’ll send them to you tomorrow. Notice a new cut of sleeves. It’s beautiful. I’ve already sent orders to the Court. There are plenty of travel articles in it and they are the best.”,CO013CL11
13067,204,“It’s almost useless to send them to me.”,CO013CL11
13068,205,“Why?”,CO013CL11
13069,206,“I almost never leave the house.”,CO013CL11
13070,207,“You’re not even going to have dinner with me on New Year’s Eve!”,CO013CL11
13071,208,“Oh! Surely!”,CO013CL11
13072,209,"“So, you’re going… Ah! Is the man going? Mr. Tito?”",CO013CL11
13073,210,“If he’s here… and if you want…”,CO013CL11
13074,211,"“Well, let him go, it won’t hurt… I will know how to hold him back… I don’t think he’ll ever be so… uncivil. I don’t know how you can keep this cold-blood! It disagrees with my nerves!”",CO013CL11
13075,212,“He’s indifferent to me.”,CO013CL11
13076,213,“But the insult to our sex… doesn’t it upset you?”,CO013CL11
13077,214,“Little.”,CO013CL11
13078,215,“You’re lucky.”,CO013CL11
13079,216,“What do you want me to do to a man who says that? If I weren’t married it was possible I’d be more offended. If I was free I was likely to do what you did to the other. But I cannot take care of these things…”,CO013CL11
13080,217,"“Not even listening to the preference to voltarete? To put us under the queen of hearts! And the air with which he says it! How calm, how indifferent!”",CO013CL11
13081,218,“It’s bad! It’s bad!”,CO013CL11
13082,219,“He deserves punishment…”,CO013CL11
13083,220,“He deserves it. Do you want to punish him?”,CO013CL11
13084,221,Emília made a gesture of disdain and said:,CO013CL11
13085,222,“It’s not worth it.”,CO013CL11
13086,223,“But you punished the other one.”,CO013CL11
13087,224,“Yes… but it’s not worth it.”,CO013CL11
13088,225,“Slyer!”,CO013CL11
13089,226,“Why are you saying that?”,CO013CL11
13090,227,“Because I already see you being tempted to a new revenge…”,CO013CL11
13091,228,“Me? Come on!”,CO013CL11
13092,229,“So what? It’s not a crime…”,CO013CL11
13093,230,"“It’s not, for sure; but… we’ll see.”",CO013CL11
13094,231,“Ah! Will you be capable?”,CO013CL11
13095,232,“Capable?” Emília said with a gesture of offended pride.,CO013CL11
13096,233,“Will he kiss the tip of your shoe?”,CO013CL11
13097,234,"Emília was silent for a few moments; then, pointing with the hand fan to the boot that shoed her foot, she said:",CO013CL11
13098,235,“And it will be these.”,CO013CL11
13099,236,"Emília and Adelaide went to the side where the men were. Tito, who seemed to converse intimately with Azevedo, interrupted the conversation to give his attention to the ladies. Diogo was still immersed in his meditation.",CO013CL11
13100,237,"“So what is it, Mr. Diogo?” asked Tito. “Are you meditating?”",CO013CL11
13101,238,"“Ah! Sorry, I was distracted!”",CO013CL11
13102,239,“Poor thing!” said Tito in undertone to Azevedo.,CO013CL11
13103,240,Then turning to the ladies:,CO013CL11
13104,241,“Doesn’t the cigar bother you?”,CO013CL11
13105,242,"“No, sir,” said Emília.",CO013CL11
13106,243,“So can I continue to smoke?”,CO013CL11
13107,244,"“Yes,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL11
13108,245,"“It’s a bad habit, but it’s my only vice. When I smoke it seems that I aspire to eternity. I’m enraptured and change my being. Divine invention!”",CO013CL11
13109,246,"“They say it’s great for heartbreak,” Emília said with intent.",CO013CL11
13110,247,"“I don’t know about that. But that’s not all. After the invention of smoke there is no loneliness possible. It’s the best company in the world. Moreover, the cigar is a true Memento homo: gradually becoming ashes, it reminds man of the real and infallible end of all things: it’s the philosophical warning; it’s the funeral sentence that accompanies us everywhere. It’s already great progress…",CO013CL11
13111,248,"But I am annoying you with such heavy a dissertation. You have to forgive me… that was careless. Now, to speak the truth, I am already distrustful; Your Excellency looks with such singular eyes…”",CO013CL11
13112,249,"Emília, to whom the word was addressed, answered:",CO013CL11
13113,250,"“I don’t know if they are singular, but they are mine.”",CO013CL11
13114,251,"“I don’t think they’re the usual ones. Is Your Excellency perhaps saying to herself that I am strange, singular, a…”",CO013CL11

13119,256,“Ah! I don’t answer that.”,CO013CL11
13120,257,“Because you don’t want?”,CO013CL11
13121,258,"“Because… I don’t know. It’s something one feels but cannot find out. One can breathe his vanity in everything: in look, in word, in gesture… but one isn’t aware of the true origin of such a disease.”",CO013CL11
13122,259,"“It’s too bad. I would have had great pleasure hearing from your mouth the diagnosis of my illness. On the other hand, you can hear my diagnosis of yours… Your illness is… Should I say?”",CO013CL11
13123,260,“You can say it.”,CO013CL11
13124,261,“It’s a little contempt.”,CO013CL11
13125,262,“Really?”,CO013CL11
13126,263,"“Let’s see that,” said Azevedo, laughing.",CO013CL11
13127,264,Tito continued:,CO013CL11
13128,265,“Contempt for what I said earlier.”,CO013CL11
13129,266,"“Pure deceit!” said Emília, laughing.",CO013CL11
13130,267,“That’s for sure. But it’s all gratuitous. I’m not to blame for anything. Nature is what made me so.”,CO013CL11
13131,268,“Just nature?”,CO013CL11
13132,269,“And a bit of study. Now I will tell you my reasons. See if I can love or have intentions: first I’m not handsome…”,CO013CL11
13133,270,“Oh!” said Emília.,CO013CL11
13134,271,"“Thank you for the protest, but I still share the same opinion: I am not handsome, I am not…”",CO013CL11
13135,272,“Oh!” said Adelaide.,CO013CL11
13136,273,"“Secondly, I’m not curious, and love, if we reduce it to its true proportions, is only a curiosity. Third: I’m not patient, and in amorous conquest, patience is the main virtue. Fourth, finally: I’m not an idiot, because, if I tried to love with all these flaws, I’d show the greatest lack of reason. Here is what I am by nature and by industry.”",CO013CL11
13137,274,"“Emília, he seems sincere.”",CO013CL11
13138,275,“Do you believe it?”,CO013CL11
13139,276,"“Sincere as the truth,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
13140,277,"“In the last case, whether you are sincere or not, what have I to do with it?”",CO013CL11
13141,278,"“Nothing, I believe,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
13142,279,II,CO013CL11
13143,280,"On the day after the scenes described in the previous chapter passed, the sky understood that it should water with its tears the soil of the beautiful Petrópolis.",CO013CL11
13144,281,"Tito, who was destined to see the whole city that day, was obliged to keep himself at home. He was a friend who didn’t mind because when he was too much, he was wise to escape discreetly, and when he wasn’t, he became the most delightful of companions.",CO013CL11
13145,282,"Tito knew how to combine much joviality with much nicety; he knew how to make one laugh without lacking appropriateness. To add to that, returning from a long and picturesque journey, he carried pockets of memory (let the phrase pass) full of vivid recollections. He had made a trip as a poet, not a petty coxcomb. He knew how to see and knew how to tell. These two qualities, indispensable to the traveler, unfortunately are the rarest. Most people who travel neither know how to see nor can tell.",CO013CL11
13146,283,"Tito had gone through all the republics of the Pacific Ocean, had lived in Mexico and in some American states. He had then gone to Europe on the liner from New York. He saw London and Paris. He went to Spain, where he lived the life of Almaviva, giving serenades at the windows of today’s Rosinas. He brought some hand fans and mantillas from there. He then went to Italy and raised his spirit living up to the memories of the classical art.",CO013CL11
13147,284,"He saw Dante’s shadow in the streets of Florence; saw the souls of the doges hovering over the widowed waters of the Adriatic Sea. The land of Raphael, Virgil and Michelangelo was for him a living source of memories of the past and of impressions for the future. He went to Greece, where he knew how to evoke the spirit of the extinct generations that gave the genius of art and poetry a glow which crossed the shadows of the centuries.",CO013CL11
13148,285,"Our hero traveled even farther, and he saw everything with the eyes of those who know how to see, and told everything the soul of one who knows how to tell. Azevedo and Adelaide spent forgotten hours.",CO013CL11
13149,286,"“Of love,” he said, “I only know that it’s a four-letter word, somewhat euphonic, but harbinger of struggles and misfortunes. Good loves are full of happiness, because they have the virtue of not looking up to the stars of the sky; they’re satisfied with suppers at midnight and some jaunts on horseback or at sea.”",CO013CL11
13150,287,"This was Tito’s constant language. Did it express the truth, or was it a language of convention? Everyone believed that the truth was in the first hypothesis, especially since this was in accordance to Tito’s jovial and playful spirit.",CO013CL11
13151,288,"On the first day of Tito’s residence in Petrópolis, the rain, as I said above, prevented the various characters in this story from meeting. Each one stayed in his own house.",CO013CL11
13152,289,"But the next day was more benign; Tito took advantage of the good weather to go see the smiling city of the mountains. Azevedo and Adelaide wanted to accompany him; they sent three jennets, appropriate for the short ride.",CO013CL11
13153,290,"On the way back they went to see Emília. The visit lasted only a few minutes. The beautiful widow received them with the grace and courtesy of a princess. It was the first time Tito was there; and for this, or for another circumstance, it was he who deserved the main attentions of the mistress of the house.",CO013CL11
13154,291,"Diogo, who was making his hundredth declaration of love to Emília, and to whom Emília had just offered a cup of tea, wasn’t in favor of the attention the traveler deserved from the lady of his thoughts. This, and perhaps other circumstances, made the old Adonis watch the conversation with a frown.",CO013CL11
13155,292,"At the farewell Emília offered the house to Tito, with the declaration that she would have the same satisfaction in receiving him many times. Tito graciously accepted the offer. Then, everyone left.",CO013CL11
13156,293,"Five days after this visit Emília went to Adelaide’s house. Tito wasn’t present; he had gone for a walk. Azevedo had gone out on business, but came back in a few minutes. When, after an hour of conversation, Emília was getting ready to go home, Tito entered.",CO013CL11
13157,294,"“I was about to leave when you came in,” Emília said. “We seem to be opposing on everything.”",CO013CL11
13158,295,"“That’s not by my will,” answered Tito; “on the contrary, my desire isn’t to oppose anyone, and therefore not to oppose Your Excellency.”",CO013CL11
13159,296,“It doesn’t seem so.”,CO013CL11
13160,297,“Why?”,CO013CL11
13161,298,Emília smiled and said with an inflection of reproach:,CO013CL11
13162,299,“You know I’d be happy if you used the offer for my house; still you haven’t. Was it forgetfulness?”,CO013CL11
13163,300,“It was.”,CO013CL11
13164,301,“You’re very kind…”,CO013CL11
13165,302,“I’m very frank. I know that Your Excellency preferred a delicate lie; but I know nothing more delicate than the truth.”,CO013CL11
13166,303,Emília smiled.,CO013CL11
13167,304,At that moment Diogo entered.,CO013CL11
13168,305,"“Were you going out, Mrs. Emília?” he asked.",CO013CL11
13169,306,“I was waiting for your arm.”,CO013CL11
13170,307,“Here you have it.”,CO013CL11
13171,308,"Emília bid farewell to Azevedo and Adelaide. As for Tito, when he bowed respectfully, Emília said to him with the greatest calm of the soul:",CO013CL11
13172,309,“There’s someone as delicate as the truth: it’s Mr. Diogo. I hope to say the same…”,CO013CL11
13173,310,“Of me?” interrupted Tito. “Tomorrow.”,CO013CL11
13174,311,Emília left holding Diogo’s arm.,CO013CL11
13175,312,"The next day Tito went to Emília’s house. She was waiting with some impatience. Since she didn’t know the time when he should be there, the beautiful widow had been waiting for him every moment since morning. It wasn’t until evening that Tito deigned to show up.",CO013CL11
13176,313,"Emília lived with an old aunt. She was a good lady, friend of her niece, and a complete slave to her will. This means that there was no fear in Emília that the good aunt didn’t approve it in advance.",CO013CL11
13177,314,"There was no one in the room where Tito was received. Therefore he had plenty of time to examine it at will. It was a small room, but furnished and adorned with taste. Light, elegant, and rich furniture; four of the finest statuettes, copied from Pradier; a piano by Erard; all disposed and arranged with life.",CO013CL11
13178,315,"Tito spent the first quarter of an hour examining the room and the objects which filled it. This examination was to have a great influence on his study of the young lady’s spirit. Tell me how you live, I’ll tell you who you are.",CO013CL11
13179,316,"But the first quarter of an hour passed without a soul appearing, nor was there any rumor of any kind. Tito began to grow impatient. We already know how rough-hewn he was, despite the supreme politeness that everyone recognized.",CO013CL11
13180,317,"It seems, however, that his coarseness, almost always exercised against Emília, was studied rather than natural. What is certain is that at the end of half an hour, annoyed by the delay, Tito muttered to himself:",CO013CL11
13181,318,“You want to take revenge!”,CO013CL11
13182,319,"And taking the hat he had put on a chair, he was heading for the door when he heard a rustling of silks. He turned his head; Emília was coming in.",CO013CL11
13183,320,“Were you fleeing?”,CO013CL11
13184,321,“It’s true.”,CO013CL11
13185,322,“Forgive me the delay.”,CO013CL11
13186,323,"“There is nothing to forgive; you couldn’t come, naturally it was for some serious reason. As for me, I don’t have to ask for forgiveness. I waited, I was tired, I’d come back another time. All this is natural.”",CO013CL11
13187,324,Emília offered Tito a chair and sat down on a couch.,CO013CL11
13188,325,"“Actually,” she said, seating her balloon skirt, “Mr. Tito is an original man.”",CO013CL11
13189,326,"“It’s my glory. You cannot imagine how I hate copies. To do what many people do, what merit is there in this? I was not born for these works of imitation.”",CO013CL11
13190,327,“You’ve done something like a lot of people do.”,CO013CL11
13191,328,“What was that?”,CO013CL11
13192,329,“You promised me this visit yesterday and you came to keep the promise.”,CO013CL11
13193,330,"“Ah! My lady, don’t put this on the account of my virtues. He could have not come; I came, it wasn’t will, it was… chance.”",CO013CL11
13194,331,"“Anyway, thank you.”",CO013CL11
13195,332,“It’s the way to close your door to me.”,CO013CL11
13196,333,“Why?,CO013CL11
13197,334,"“Because I don’t get along with thankfulness nor believe that it can add anything to my admiration for Your Excellency’s person. Many times I went to visit the statues of the museums of Europe, but if they remembered to thank me one day, I give you my word that I wouldn’t go back there.”",CO013CL11
13198,335,To these words followed a silence of a few seconds.,CO013CL11
13199,336,Emília spoke first.,CO013CL11
13200,337,“Have you known Adelaide’s husband a long time?”,CO013CL11
13201,338,"“Since a child,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
13202,339,“Ah! You were a child?”,CO013CL11
13203,340,“I still am today.”,CO013CL11
13204,341,“It’s exactly the time of my relations with Adelaide. I’ve never regretted it.”,CO013CL11
13205,342,“Me neither.”,CO013CL11
13206,343,"“There was a time,” Emília went on, “that we were separated; but this didn’t bring any change to our relations. It was at the time of my first marriage.”",CO013CL11
13207,344,“Ah! Were you married twice?”,CO013CL11
13208,345,“In two years.”,CO013CL11
13209,346,“And why did you become widowed the first time?”,CO013CL11
13210,347,"“Because my husband died,” Emília said, laughing.",CO013CL11
13211,348,"“But I’ll ask you something else. Why did you become a widow, even after the death of your first husband? I think you might still be married.”",CO013CL11
13212,349,“How?” Emília asked in amazement.,CO013CL11
13213,350,"“Becoming the deceased’s wife. If love ends up in the grave, I don’t think it’s worth looking for in this world.”",CO013CL11
13214,351,“Mr. Tito really is a spirit out of the ordinary.”,CO013CL11
13215,352,“A little.”,CO013CL11
13216,353,"“One must be so that one ignores that our life doesn’t admit these demands of eternal fidelity. And besides, one can keep the memory of those who die without renouncing the conditions of our existence. Now I ask why you look at me with such singular eyes?”",CO013CL11
13217,354,"“I don’t know if they are singular, but they are mine.",CO013CL11
13218,355,So you think I committed bigamy?”,CO013CL11
13219,356,"“I don’t think anything. Now, let me tell you the last reason for my inability to love.”",CO013CL11
13220,357,“I’m all ears.”,CO013CL11
13221,358,“I don’t believe in fidelity.”,CO013CL11
13222,359,“Not at all?”,CO013CL11
13223,360,“Not at all.”,CO013CL11
13224,361,“Thank you.”,CO013CL11
13225,362,"“Ah! I know this is not polite; but in the first place, I have the courage of my opinions, and secondly it was Your Excellency who provoked me. It’s unfortunately true, I don’t believe in loyal and eternal loves.",CO013CL11
13226,363,"I want to make you my confidante.  There was a day that I tried to love; I concentrated all the living forces of my heart; I set about gathering my pride and my illusion at the head of the beloved object. What a master lesson! The beloved object, after giving me hope, married another who was neither handsome nor more loving.”",CO013CL11
13227,364,“What does that prove?” asked the widow.,CO013CL11
13228,365,“It proves that what has happened to me can and happens to others on a daily basis.”,CO013CL11
13229,366,“Now…”,CO013CL11
13230,367,"“You will forgive me, but I believe it’s something already in the blood.”",CO013CL11
13231,368,"“Don’t say that. Admittedly, such cases may occur; but are they all like this? Don’t you admit an exception? Dig deeper into the hearts of others if you want to find the truth… and you will find it.”",CO013CL11
13232,369,"“What!” said Tito, bowing his head and tapping his cane on the tip of his foot.",CO013CL11
13233,370,"“I can assert it,” Emília said.",CO013CL11
13234,371,“I doubt it.”,CO013CL11
13235,372,"“I pity such a creature,” continued the widow. “Not knowing love is not knowing life! Is there anything like the union of two souls who worship each other? Since love enters the heart, everything transforms, everything changes, night seems day, pain resembles pleasure… If you don’t know any of this, you can die, because you’re the most unfortunate of men.”",CO013CL11
13236,373,"“I’ve read this in the books, but I’m still not convinced…”",CO013CL11
13237,374,“Have you already noticed my living room?”,CO013CL11
13238,375,“I’ve seen something.”,CO013CL11
13239,376,“Have you noticed that picture?”,CO013CL11
13240,377,Tito looked at the picture the widow was telling him about.,CO013CL11
13241,378,"“If I’m not mistaken,” he said, “that is love taming the beasts.”",CO013CL11
13242,379,“Look and be convinced.”,CO013CL11
13243,380,"“With the designer’s opinion?” asked Tito. “It’s not possible. I have seen the paintings live. I have been the target of many arrows; they riddle me all over, but I have the fortress of San Sebastian; I confront, I don’t bow down.",CO013CL11
13244,381,“Such pride!”,CO013CL11
13245,382,"“What can bend such haughtiness? The beauty? Not even Cleopatra. Chastity? Not even Susana. Summarize, if you will, all the qualities in one creature, and I will not change… It’s this and nothing else.”",CO013CL11
13246,383,Emília got up and went to the piano.,CO013CL11
13247,384,"“Doesn’t music bother you?” she asked, opening the piano.",CO013CL11
13248,385,"“I adore it,” replied the young man without moving; “now as for the performers I only like the good ones. The wicked ones give me the urge to hang them.”",CO013CL11
13249,386,Emília performed at the piano the preludes of a symphony. Tito listened to her with the most profound attention. The beautiful widow really played divinely.,CO013CL11
13250,387,"“So,” she said, getting up, “should I be hanged?”",CO013CL11
13251,388,“You must be crowned. You play perfectly.”,CO013CL11
13252,389,“Another point where you’re not original. Everybody tells me that.”,CO013CL11
13253,390,“Ah! I don’t deny the sunshine either.”,CO013CL11
13254,391,"At that moment Emília’s aunt entered the room. She introduced him to Tito. The conversation then took a personal and reserved tone; it didn’t last long, because Tito, suddenly grabbing his hat, declared that he had something to do.",CO013CL11
13255,392,“Until when?”,CO013CL11
13256,393,“Until forever.”,CO013CL11
13257,394,He said goodbye and left.,CO013CL11
13258,395,"Emília still followed him with her eyes for some time, from the window of the house. But Tito, as if he didn’t care, went without looking back.",CO013CL11
13259,396,"But just as Emília was coming back inside, Tito met old Diogo. Diogo was heading for the widow’s house. He looked pensive. He was so distracted that he almost bumped into Tito.",CO013CL11
13260,397,“Where are you going so distracted?” asked Tito.,CO013CL11
13261,398,"“Ah! It’s you, sir? Are you coming from Mrs. Emília’s house?”",CO013CL11
13262,399,“I am.”,CO013CL11
13263,400,“I’m going there. Poor thing! She must be very impatient with my delay…”,CO013CL11
13264,401,"“She is not, no sir,” said Tito with the greatest cold-bloodedness.",CO013CL11
13265,402,Diogo gave him a look of spite.,CO013CL11
13266,403,"This was followed by a silence of a few minutes, during which Diogo played with the chain of his watch, and Tito threw clouds of smoke from an exquisite Havana into the air. One of those clouds unfolded in Diogo’s face. The old man coughed and said to Tito:",CO013CL11
13267,404,"“Come on, Mr. Tito! It’s too much!”",CO013CL11
13268,405,"“What, my dear sir?” asked the young man.",CO013CL11
13269,406,“Even your smoke!”,CO013CL11
13270,407,“I didn’t notice. But I don’t understand your words…”,CO013CL11
13271,408,"“I’ll explain myself,” the old man said, smiling. “Give me your arm…”",CO013CL11
13272,409,“Certainly!”,CO013CL11
13273,410,And they went on talking like two old friends.,CO013CL11
13274,411,“I’m ready to listen to your explanation.”,CO013CL11
13275,412,"“There you go. Do you know what I want? That you be frank. You don’t ignore that I sigh at the widow’s feet. I beg you not to discuss the fact, simply admit it. So far everything was going well then you arrived in Petrópolis.”",CO013CL11
13276,413,“But…”,CO013CL11
13277,414,"“Listen to me silently. Sir, you arrive in Petrópolis, and without any harm done to you, you understood to yourself that you’d take me out of the way. Since then the courting began…”",CO013CL11
13278,415,"“My dear Mr. Diogo, this is all fantasy. I’m not courting Mrs. Emília, nor do I intend to do so. Do you see me frequenting her house?”",CO013CL11
13279,416,“”You’ve just come out of there.”,CO013CL11
13280,417,“This is the first time I’ve visited her.”,CO013CL11
13281,418,“Who knows?”,CO013CL11
13282,419,"“Besides, just yesterday didn’t you hear at Azevedo’s house the expressions with which she said goodbye to me? They’re not from a woman who…”",CO013CL11
13283,420,"“Ah! It doesn’t prove anything. Women, and especially that one, don’t always say what they feel…”",CO013CL11
13284,421,“So you think that she feels something for me?”,CO013CL11
13285,422,"“If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t talk to you.”",CO013CL11
13286,423,“Ah! Now there is something new.”,CO013CL11
13287,424,"“I only suspect. She only talks to me about you; she asks me twenty times a day of your person, your habits, your past and your opinions… I, as you will believe, reply that I don’t know to everything, but I’m starting to hate you, for which you cannot ever incriminate me.”",CO013CL11
13288,425,"“Is it my fault if she likes me? Well, rest assured, Mr. Diogo. Neither does she like me, nor do I like her. Work unfazed and be happy.”",CO013CL11
13289,426,"“Happy! If I could be! But no… I don’t believe it; happiness wasn’t made for me. Look, Mr. Tito, I love that woman as one can love life. A look from her is worth more to me than a year of glory and happiness. It’s for her that I have left my business adrift. Don’t you know that the other day a letter came to me, the reading of which made me sad? I lost a cause. Why? Because of her!”",CO013CL11
13290,427,“But doesn’t she give you hope?”,CO013CL11
13291,428,"“I know what that young lady is like! Sometimes she treats me so that I go to seventh heaven; sometimes such is her indifference that she throws me into hell. Today a smile, tomorrow a gesture of disdain. It annoys me not to visit her; I’m going to visit her, she cares as much for me as for Ganymede. Ganymede is the name of a fluffy dog that I gave her. She cares about me as much as for the dog… It’s on purpose. She’s an enigma that young lady.”",CO013CL11
13292,429,"“Well, I won’t be the one to decipher her, Mr. Diogo. I wish you much happiness. Goodbye.”",CO013CL11
13293,430,"And the two went their own ways. Diogo went to Emília’s house, Tito to Azevedo’s house.",CO013CL11
13294,431,"Tito had just learned that the widow thought about him; but that had not given him the slightest shock. Why? This is what we will know later. What must be said right now is that Azevedo’s wife had had the same suspicions that were aroused in the Diogo’s spirit. Emília’s intimacy gave way to a frank questioning and a frank confession. Adelaide, the day after the scene that I mentioned above, told Emília what she thought.",CO013CL11
13295,432,The widow’s answer was a laugh.,CO013CL11
13296,433,"“I don’t understand you,” said Azevedo’s wife.",CO013CL11
13297,434,"“It’s simple,” said the widow. “Do you think I can fall in love with your husband’s friend? You’re mistaken. No, I don’t love him. It’s just that, as I told you the day I saw him here for the first time, I strive to have him at my feet. If I remember correctly you were the one who gave me the advice. I accepted it. I will avenge our sex. It’s a little of my vanity, though; but I believe that I will do what no other woman has done.”",CO013CL11
13298,435,“Ah! Cruel young lady! Is that it?”,CO013CL11
13299,436,"“Nothing more, nothing less.”",CO013CL11
13300,437,“Do you think it’s possible?”,CO013CL11
13301,438,“Why not?”,CO013CL11
13302,439,“Consider that the defeat will be double…”,CO013CL11
13303,440,"“It will, but it might not be.”",CO013CL11
13304,441,"This conversation was interrupted by Azevedo. A sign from Emília quieted Adelaide. It was agreed that even Azevedo would know nothing of it. And, indeed, Adelaide communicated nothing to her husband.",CO013CL11
13305,442,III,CO013CL11
13306,443,It had been eight days since what I’ve just told you.,CO013CL11
13307,444,"Tito, as we have seen so far, was on the first day of the plot. He would walk, read, talk, and seem entirely oblivious to the plans that were crawling around him. During this time he went only twice to Emília’s house, once with Azevedo’s family, the other time with Diogo.",CO013CL11
13308,445,"These visits were always the same: cold, indifferent, impassive. There was no looks, however seductive and significant, that shook him; nor was the idea that he was in the widow’s mind able to encourage him.",CO013CL11
13309,446,"“Why don’t you at least, if you cannot love, try to entertain one of those lounge dates, which flatter the vanity of men so much?”",CO013CL11
13310,447,"This question was asked by Emília to herself, under the impression of the strangeness of the boy’s indifference. She didn’t understand that Tito could keep himself on ice before her charms. But unfortunately it was so.",CO013CL11
13311,448,"Tired of working in vain, the widow was determined to make a more decisive blow. She led the conversation toward the sweetness of marriage and lamented the state of her widowhood. The Azevedos were to her the perfect type of marital bliss. She presented it to Tito’s eyes as an incentive for those who wanted to be fortunate on earth. Nothing, neither the thesis, nor the hypothesis, nothing changed Tito’s coldness.",CO013CL11
13312,449,"Emília was playing a dangerous game. It was necessary to decide between her desires to avenge her sex and the conveniences of her position; but she was of an imperious character; she very much respected the principles of her severe morality, but she didn’t likewise accept the conveniences of which society surrounded this morality. Vanity was in her spirit with a prodigious force. So that the beautiful widow was using all means that were lawful to employ to make Tito fall in love.",CO013CL11
13313,450,"But, when he was in love, what would she do? The question is idle; as long as she had him at her feet, she would try to keep him there in tandem with old Diogo. It was the best trophy a haughty beauty can covet.",CO013CL11
13314,451,"One morning, eight days after the scenes mentioned in the previous episode, Diogo showed up at Azevedo’s house. They had just finished lunch; Azevedo had gone upstairs to the office, to dispatch some correspondence to the Court; Adelaide was in the room on the ground floor.",CO013CL11
13315,452,"Diogo entered with a sad face, as never seen before. Adelaide ran to him.",CO013CL11
13316,453,“What is it?” she asked.,CO013CL11
13317,454,“Ah! My lady… I am the most unhappy of men!”,CO013CL11
13318,455,“Why? Come and sit…”,CO013CL11
13319,456,"Diogo sat down, or rather fell into the chair Adelaide offered him. She took place at his feet, encouraging him to tell her about his sorrows.",CO013CL11
13320,457,"“So, what is it?”",CO013CL11
13321,458,"“Two misfortunes,” he replied. “The first in the form of a sentence. I lost another lawsuit. It’s a disgrace, but this is nothing…”",CO013CL11
13322,459,"“Why, is there more?…”",CO013CL11
13323,460,“There is. The second disgrace was in the form of a letter.”,CO013CL11
13324,461,“A letter?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL11
13325,462,“A letter. Look at this.”,CO013CL11
13326,463,"Diogo took out a rose-colored card from his wallet, which smelled of magnolia.",CO013CL11
13327,464,Adelaide read the letter to herself.,CO013CL11
13328,465,"When she had finished, the old man asked her:",CO013CL11
13329,466,“What do you say to this?”,CO013CL11
13330,467,"“I don’t understand,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL11
13331,468,“This is her letter.”,CO013CL11
13332,469,"“Yes, and then?”",CO013CL11
13333,470,“It’s for him.”,CO013CL11
13334,471,“He who?”,CO013CL11
13335,472,“He! The devil! My rival! Tito!”,CO013CL11
13336,473,“Ah!”,CO013CL11
13337,474,"“Telling you what I felt when I picked up this letter is impossible. I never shivered in my life! But when I read this, I don’t know what vertigo has seized me. I’m dizzy! With each step I feel faint… Ah!”",CO013CL11
13338,475,“Courage!” said Adelaide.,CO013CL11
13339,476,"“That’s what I came for… some consolation, some encouragement. I knew you were here and I thought I’d find you alone… Ah! How much I grieve that your estimable husband is alive… because the best consolation would be for Your Excellency to accept such a misunderstood heart.",CO013CL11
13340,477,“Fortunately he’s alive.”,CO013CL11
13341,478,Diogo let out a sigh and said.,CO013CL11
13342,479,“Fortunately!”,CO013CL11
13343,480,And after a silence he continued:,CO013CL11
13344,481,“I had two ideas: one was contempt; but to feel contempt for them is to put them in greater freedom and to shred myself with pain and shame; the second was the duel… it’s better… I kill… or…”,CO013CL11
13345,482,“Leave it alone.”,CO013CL11
13346,483,“It’s indispensable that one of us be scratched out from the book of the living.”,CO013CL11
13347,484,“It could be a mistake…”,CO013CL11
13348,485,"“But it’s not a mistake, it’s a certainty.”",CO013CL11
13349,486,“Certainty of what?”,CO013CL11
13350,487,Diogo opened the note and said:,CO013CL11
13351,488,"“Now, listen: ‘If you still don’t understand me, you’re very short in penetration. Take off the mask and I’ll explain myself. I have tea alone tonight. The annoying Diogo won’t bother me with his foolishness. Give me the happiness of seeing you and admiring you. – Emília.’”",CO013CL11
13352,489,“But what is this?”,CO013CL11
13353,490,"“What is this? Ah! If it was more than this I was already dead! I was able to plunder the letter, and that interview didn’t happen…”",CO013CL11
13354,491,“When was the letter written?”,CO013CL11
13355,492,“Yesterday.”,CO013CL11
13356,493,“Calm down. Can you keep a secret? What I’m going to tell you is serious. But only your affliction makes me speak. I can assure you that this letter is a pure joke. It’s avenging our outraged sex; it’s about getting Tito to fall in love… nothing else.”,CO013CL11
13357,494,Diogo shuddered with joy.,CO013CL11
13358,495,“True?” he asked.,CO013CL11
13359,496,"“It’s the pure truth. But look, this is a secret. If I gave it away it was because I saw you distressed. Don’t implicate us.”",CO013CL11
13360,497,“Is this serious?” insisted Diogo.,CO013CL11
13361,498,“What do you want me to say?”,CO013CL11
13362,499,"“Ah! What weight you took off me? You can be sure that the secret fell into a pit. Oh! I will laugh a lot. I shall laugh very much… What a good inspiration I had in coming to speak to you! Tell me, can I tell Mrs. Emília that I know everything?”",CO013CL11
13363,500,“No!”,CO013CL11
13364,501,“Then it’s best to pretend ignorance…”,CO013CL11
13365,502,“Yes.”,CO013CL11
13366,503,“Very well!”,CO013CL11
13367,504,"Old Diogo said these words, rubbing his hands and blinking his eyes. He was radiant. What! To see the supposed rival being a victim of the widow’s trap! What glory! What happiness!",CO013CL11
13368,505,He was at this when Tito showed up at the door. He had just gotten out of bed.,CO013CL11
13369,506,"“Good morning, Mrs. Adelaide,” he said, turning to Azevedo’s wife.
Then sitting up and turning to face Diogo:",CO013CL11
13370,507,"“Good morning,” he said. You are happy today… Did you strike it rich?”",CO013CL11
13371,508,“Strike it rich?” asked Diogo. “I did… I did…”,CO013CL11
13372,509,“Did you sleep well?” Adelaide asked Tito.,CO013CL11
13373,510,“As the fair man I am. I had rosy dreams: I dreamed of Mr. Diogo.”,CO013CL11
13374,511,“Ah! You dreamed of me?” the old boyfriend muttered between his teeth. “Poor thing! I’m sorry for him!”,CO013CL11
13375,512,“But where is Azevedo?” asked Tito to Adelaide.,CO013CL11
13376,513,“He went for a walk.”,CO013CL11
13377,514,“Already?”,CO013CL11
13378,515,"“Well, it’s eleven o’clock.”",CO013CL11
13379,516,"“Eleven o’clock! It’s true, I woke up very late. I had two visits to make: one to Mrs. Emília…”",CO013CL11
13380,517,“Ah!” said Diogo.,CO013CL11
13381,518,"“What are you scared of, my dear?”",CO013CL11
13382,519,“Nothing! Nothing!”,CO013CL11
13383,520,"“Good; I’ll have your lunch served,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL11
13384,521,"The two men were alone. Tito lit a corn husk cigarette; Diogo showed great distraction, but he was glancing at the young man. This one, just let out two puffs, turned to the old man and said:",CO013CL11
13385,522,“How is your love?”,CO013CL11
13386,523,“What love?”,CO013CL11
13387,524,"“Yours, Emília… Have you made her understand all the immensity of the passion that devours you?”",CO013CL11
13388,525,“What… I need some lessons… if you wanted to give me?”,CO013CL11
13389,526,“Me? You’re dreaming!”,CO013CL11
13390,527,"“Ah! I know you are strong… You are modest, but you are strong… and even very strong! Why, I’m really an apprentice… I just had the idea of challenging you.”",CO013CL11
13391,528,“Challenge me?”,CO013CL11
13392,529,"“It’s true, but it was madness that I’ve regretted.”",CO013CL11
13393,530,“Besides that is not a custom in our country…”,CO013CL11
13394,531,“Everywhere is a custom to avenge honor.”,CO013CL11
13395,532,"“Bravo, Don Quixote!”",CO013CL11
13396,533,"“Well, I thought I was offended in my honor.”",CO013CL11
13397,534,“By me?”,CO013CL11
13398,535,"“But I mended my ways; I noticed that I was the one who offended, intending to fight with a master, me, a simple apprentice…”",CO013CL11
13399,536,“Master of what?”,CO013CL11
13400,537,“Of love! Oh! I know you’re a master…”,CO013CL11
13401,538,"“Come out of that… I’m nothing… Mr. Diogo, yes; you’re a bear, you’re worth two. How could I… Why, I bet you were jealous?”",CO013CL11
13402,539,“Exactly.”,CO013CL11
13403,540,“But you must not know me. Don’t you know my ideas?”,CO013CL11
13404,541,"“Man, sometimes it’s worse.”",CO013CL11
13405,542,"“Worse, how?”",CO013CL11
13406,543,“Women don’t leave an affront without punishment… Their ideas are outrageous… What will be the punishment? I stop here… I stop here…”,CO013CL11
13407,544,“Where are you going?”,CO013CL11
13408,545,“I’m going out. Goodbye. Don’t think about my disastrous idea of the duel anymore…”,CO013CL11
13409,546,“That it’s finished… Ah! You have freed yourself!”,CO013CL11
13410,547,“Of what?”,CO013CL11
13411,548,"“Of dying. I’d stick my sword through your abdomen… with pleasure… with a pleasure only comparable to the pleasure I’d have of hugging you, safe and sound!”",CO013CL11
13412,549,Diogo gave a half-hearted laugh.,CO013CL11
13413,550,“Thank you. Thank you. See you later!”,CO013CL11
13414,551,"“Come here, where are you going? Aren’t you saying goodbye to Mrs. Adelaide?”",CO013CL11
13415,552,"“I’ll be right back,” Diogo said, snapping his hat and hurrying out.",CO013CL11
13416,553,Tito still followed him with his eyes.,CO013CL11
13417,554,"“This fellow,” said the young man when he was alone, “he is nothing original. That opinion about women is not his… Better… he’s already conspiring; that’s what suits me. You will come! You will come!”",CO013CL11
13418,555,A German servant came and told Tito that lunch was ready. Tito was coming in when Azevedo’s figure showed up at the door.,CO013CL11
13419,556,"“Oh, thank God! My friend doesn’t get up with the sun. You have the eyes of those who have just slept.”",CO013CL11
13420,557,"“That’s true, and I’m going to have lunch.”",CO013CL11
13421,558,"They both went inside, where the table was waiting for Tito.",CO013CL11

13423,560,“No.”,CO013CL11
13424,561,“Then you’ll see how it is to eat.”,CO013CL11
13425,562,Tito sat at the table; Azevedo stretched out on a sofa.,CO013CL11
13426,563,“Where did you go?” asked Tito.,CO013CL11
13427,564,"“I went for a walk… I understood that it’s necessary to see and admire what is indifferent, to appreciate and to see better that which makes the happiness of the heart.”",CO013CL11
13428,565,“Ah! Yes? You see that even happiness is equally fatiguing! After all there’s always reason on my side.”,CO013CL11
13429,566,"“Perhaps. Despite all opposition, it seems to me that you’re already trying to get into the family of the married.”",CO013CL11

13434,571,“Which truth!”,CO013CL11
13435,572,"“What I know is that one of those afternoons when you fell asleep reading, I don’t know which book, I heard you pronouncing, with the greatest tenderness, Emília’s name in dreams.”",CO013CL11
13436,573,“Really?” asked Tito chewing.,CO013CL11
13437,574,"“That’s right. I concluded that if you dreamed of her it’s because you had her in your thoughts, and if you had it in your thoughts it’s because you loved her.”",CO013CL11
13438,575,“You worked it out wrong.”,CO013CL11
13439,576,“Wrong?”,CO013CL11
13440,577,“You worked it out as a five-month-old husband. What does a dream prove?”,CO013CL11
13441,578,“It proves a lot!”,CO013CL11
13442,579,“It doesn’t prove anything! You are like a superstitious old woman…”,CO013CL11
13443,580,"“But anyway, there’s hint of something… Will you be able to tell me what it is?”",CO013CL11
13444,581,"“Man, I could tell you something if you were not married…”",CO013CL11
13445,582,“What about me being married?”,CO013CL11
13446,583,"“Everything. It would be involuntarily and even unknowingly indiscreet. At night, between a kiss and a yawn, husband and wife open the bag of confidences to each other. Without thinking, you can throw everything away.”",CO013CL11
13447,584,“Don’t say that. Come on. Is there news?”,CO013CL11
13448,585,“There is nothing.”,CO013CL11

13450,587,"“I don’t hate her, that’s true.”",CO013CL11
13451,588,"“You like her. And she deserves it. She is a good lady, of no vulgar beauty, possessing the best qualities. Maybe you would rather prefer she wasn’t a widow?”",CO013CL11
13452,589,“Yes; it’s natural that she wrap herself ten times a day in the memory of the two husbands who she has already exported to the other world… waiting to export the third…”,CO013CL11
13453,590,“She’s not like that…”,CO013CL11
13454,591,“Do you guarantee?”,CO013CL11
13455,592,“I can almost guarantee.”,CO013CL11
13456,593,"“Ah! My friend,” said Tito rising from the table and going to light a cigar, “take the advice of a fool: never guarantee anything, especially in such matters. Between discreet prudence, and whose confidence it’s not lawful to doubt, the choice is decided in the very terms of the first. What can you say about Emília?",CO013CL11
13457,594,"You don’t know her better than I do. We have known each other for fifteen days, and I already read her inner side; I’m far from attributing bad feelings to her, but I’m sure that she doesn’t possess the very rare qualities which are necessary for the exception. What do you know?”",CO013CL11
13458,595,“I really don’t know anything.”,CO013CL11
13459,596,“You know nothing!” Tito said to himself.,CO013CL11
13460,597,“I speak from my impressions. It seemed to me that a marriage between the two of you wasn’t unreasonable.”,CO013CL11
13461,598,"“If you tell me about marriage again, I’ll leave.”",CO013CL11
13462,599,"“Why, just the word?”",CO013CL11
13463,600,"“The word, the idea, everything.”",CO013CL11
13464,601,"“In the meantime, you admire and applaud my marriage…”",CO013CL11
13465,602,“Ah! I applaud the many other things I’m not able use. It depends on the vocation…”,CO013CL11
13466,603,Adelaide appeared at the door of the dining room. The conversation between the two young men ended.,CO013CL11
13467,604,“I bring you some news.”,CO013CL11
13468,605,“What news?” they asked her.,CO013CL11
13469,606,"“I got a note from Emília… Asking us to go there tomorrow, because…”",CO013CL11
13470,607,“Because?” asked Azevedo.,CO013CL11
13471,608,“Maybe in eight days she’ll go off to the city.”,CO013CL11
13472,609,“Ah!” said Tito with the greatest indifference of this world.,CO013CL11
13473,610,"“Get your bags ready,” said Azevedo to Tito.",CO013CL11

13478,615,Adelaide smiled at these words.,CO013CL11
13479,616,"After half an hour Tito went up to the office where Azevedo had the books. “I was going,” he said, “to read the Confessions of St. Augustine.”",CO013CL11
13480,617,“What sudden trip is this?” Azevedo asked his wife.,CO013CL11
13481,618,“Do you really endeavor to know?”,CO013CL11
13482,619,“I do.”,CO013CL11
13483,620,"“All right. Look, it’s a secret. I don’t know for sure, but I think it’s a strategy.”",CO013CL11

13485,622,“I tell you. It’s about catching Tito.”,CO013CL11
13486,623,“Catching?”,CO013CL11
13487,624,“You’re such a dunce today! Catching in the bonds of love…”,CO013CL11
13488,625,“Ah!”,CO013CL11
13489,626,"“Emília thought she should do it. It’s just for fun. The day he declares himself defeated, she is avenged for what he said against our sex.”",CO013CL11
13490,627,“That’s not bad… And you got into this strategy…”,CO013CL11
13491,628,“As a counselor.”,CO013CL11

13494,631,Azevedo laughed his head off. Deep down he thought poor Tito’s premeditated punishment was funny.,CO013CL11
13495,632,The visit that Tito said he had to make to the widow that day didn’t come true.,CO013CL11
13496,633,"Diogo, who had just left Azevedo’s house, aware of the intentions of the widow, went to her house to wait for the young man. He was there during the day in vain, and in vain he ate dinner. He bored both Emília and her aunt all night in vain; Tito didn’t show up.",CO013CL11
13497,634,"But, at night, at the time when Diogo, already so much vexed by such a delay in the young lady’s house, was trying to leave, Tito’s arrival was announced.",CO013CL11
13498,635,Emília trembled; but this movement escaped Diogo.,CO013CL11
13499,636,"Tito entered the room where Emília, the aunt, and Diogo were.",CO013CL11
13500,637,"“I didn’t expect your visit,” said the widow.",CO013CL11
13501,638,“I’m like this; I show up when you don’t expect me. I’m like death and great fortune.”,CO013CL11
13502,639,"“Now it’s great fortune,” said Emília.",CO013CL11
13503,640,"“What number is your ticket, madam?”",CO013CL11
13504,641,"“Number twelve, that is, twelve hours I have had the pleasure of having Mr. Diogo here today…”",CO013CL11
13505,642,"“Twelve hours!” exclaimed Tito, turning to the old man.",CO013CL11
13506,643,“Without our good friend telling us a single story yet…”,CO013CL11
13507,644,“Twelve hours!” repeated Tito.,CO013CL11
13508,645,"“What are you wondering, my dear sir?” asked Diogo.",CO013CL11
13509,646,“I find it a bit stretched…”,CO013CL11
13510,647,“The hours are counted when they are boring… I beg my leave…”,CO013CL11
13511,648,"And saying this, Diogo grabbed his hat to leave, looking with spite and jealousy at the widow.",CO013CL11
13512,649,“What’s this?” she asked. “Where are you going?”,CO013CL11
13513,650,"“I give wings to the hours,” answered Diogo in Emília’s ear; “they’ll run fast now.”",CO013CL11
13514,651,“I forgive you and I ask you to sit down.”,CO013CL11
13515,652,Diogo sat down.,CO013CL11
13516,653,Emília’s aunt asked to leave for a few minutes. The three of them remained.,CO013CL11
13517,654,"“But then,” said Tito, “you didn’t even tell one story?”",CO013CL11
13518,655,“None.”,CO013CL11
13519,656,"Emília glanced at Diogo as if to reassure him. This one, calmer then, remembered what Adelaide had said to him, and recovered.",CO013CL11
13520,657,"“After all,” he said to himself, “it’s him being mocked. I’m just the means to catch him… Let’s get him to bow down.”",CO013CL11
13521,658,"“No story,” Emília continued.",CO013CL11
13522,659,"“Well, I know many,” Diogo said intently.",CO013CL11
13523,660,"“Tell one of the many you know,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
13524,661,"“No! Why don’t you tell, sir?”",CO013CL11
13525,662,“If you insist…”,CO013CL11
13526,663,"“Very… very much,” said Diogo, blinking his eyes. “Tell us, for example, the story of the swindled, the story of the impostures of love, the story of the armored travelers; Go on, go on.”",CO013CL11
13527,664,"“No, I’m going to tell you the story of a man and a monkey.”",CO013CL11

13531,668,“Yes.”,CO013CL11
13532,669,"Soon the tea was served to the three of them. When it was finished, Tito took the floor and began the story:",CO013CL11
13533,670,THE STORY OF A MAN AND A MONKEY,CO013CL11
13534,671,"Not far from the village of ***, in the countryside of Brazil, a thirty-five year old man lived, whose mysterious life was the object of conversations of the nearby towns, and the object of terror experienced by the travelers who went through the road two steps from the house.",CO013CL11
13535,672,"The house itself was already a cause of apprehensions to the less timorous spirit. Viewed from a distance, it didn’t look like a house, it was so small. But whoever approached it would know that singular construction. Half the building was at ground level and half below ground. It was, however, a solidly built house. There were no doors or windows. There was a square span that served as both window and door. It was through that the mysterious dweller came in and out.",CO013CL11
13536,673,"Few people would see him leave, not only because he seldom did it, but also because he did it at improper times. It was during the times of the full moon that the solitary man left the residence to go around the surroundings. He always carried with him a big monkey, which went by the name of Caligula.",CO013CL11
13537,674,"The monkey and the man, the man and the monkey, were two inseparable friends, in and out of the house, on the new moon.",CO013CL11
13538,675,A thousand ideas ran about this mysterious loner.,CO013CL11
13539,676,The most common was that he was a sorcerer. There was one that had him as crazy; another as simply suffering from misanthropy.,CO013CL11
13540,677,"This last version had two circumstances on its own: the first was that there was positively nothing that made the habits of a sorcerer or a lunatic recognizable in the man; the second was the friendship that he seemed to devote to the monkey and the horror with which he avoided the eyes of men. When we get bored of men, we always take the affection of the animals, which have the advantage of neither discourse nor slander.",CO013CL11
13541,678,The mysterious… You have to give him a name: let’s call him Daniel. Daniel preferred the monkey and didn’t speak to any other man. Sometimes travelers passing by on the road could hear the monkey and the man shout from within the house; it was the man caressing the monkey.,CO013CL11
13542,679,"How did those two creatures feed? Someone saw one day in the morning the door opening, the monkey getting out and returning shortly after with a package in its mouth. The muleteer who witnessed this scene wanted to find out where the monkey was going to get that package that undoubtedly carried the food of the two loners.",CO013CL11
13543,680,"The next morning he went into the bush; the monkey arrived at its usual time, and went to a tree trunk; there was a large branch on the trunk, which the animal threw to the ground. Then, putting his hands inside the old trunk, he took out a package just like the previous day’s, and left.",CO013CL11
13544,681,"The muleteer made the sign of the cross, and he was so apprehensive with the scene he had just witnessed that he didn’t tell anyone about it.",CO013CL11
13545,682,This existence had lasted for three years.,CO013CL11
13546,683,"During this time the man had not aged. He was the same as on the first day. Long red beard and long hair falling back. He wore a large baize coat, both in winter and summer. He wore boots and wore no hat.",CO013CL11
13547,684,"It was impossible for the passengers and residents of the neighborhood to enter the house of the loner. It won’t be for us, my beautiful lady, and my dear friend.",CO013CL11
13548,685,"The house is divided into two rooms and a bedroom. One room is for dinner; the other is… for visitors. The bedroom is occupied by two residents, Daniel and Caligula.",CO013CL11
13549,686,"The two rooms are of equal size; the bedroom is half the size of the living room. The furniture in the first room consists of two dirty benches against the wall, a low table in the center. The floor is parquet. Two portraits hang from the walls: one of a young lady, the other of an old man.",CO013CL11
13550,687,"The young lady is an angelic and delightful figure. The old man inspired respect and admiration. From the other two walls an ivory handle hangs on one side, a dried, yellow corpse hand on the other.",CO013CL11
13551,688,The dining room has only one table and two benches.,CO013CL11
13552,689,"The bedroom furniture is summed up as a pallet on which Daniel sleeps. Caligula stretches out on the floor, near the head of the owner.",CO013CL11
13553,690,Such is the furniture of the house.,CO013CL11
13554,691,"The house, which from the outside doesn’t seem to have enough space to contain a standing man, is nevertheless sufficient, since it is, as I said, deep-rooted in the ground.",CO013CL11
13555,692,"What life might have they spent inside, the monkey and the man, in the space of three years? I cannot say.",CO013CL11
13556,693,"When Caligula brings the package in the morning, Daniel divides the food into two portions, one for lunch and one for dinner. Then man and monkey sit facing each other in the dining room and eat the two meals brotherly.",CO013CL11
13557,694,"When the full moon arrives, the two lonely ones leave, as I have said, every night, until the time when the moon is waning. They leave at ten o’clock, or so, and return at about two o’clock in the morning. When they go inside, Daniel takes the hand of the corpse which hangs from the wall and gives it two slaps on himself. When he has done this, he goes to bed; Caligula accompanies him.",CO013CL11
13558,695,"One night, it was the month of June, in the full moon period, Daniel prepared to leave. Caligula jumped and leaped onto the road. Daniel closed the door, and off he went with the monkey up the road.",CO013CL11
13559,696,"The moon, completely full, cast its pale, melancholy reflections in the vast forest that covered nearby hills, and brightened the whole wide meadow that surrounded the house.",CO013CL11
13560,697,"There was only the murmur of a waterfall in the distance, and the sound of a few owls, and the chirping of a multitude of crickets scattered on the plain.",CO013CL11
13561,698,"Daniel walked slowly, carrying a stick under his arm and accompanied by the monkey, who jumped from the ground to Daniel’s shoulders and from Daniel’s shoulders to the ground.",CO013CL11
13562,699,"Even without the lugubrious shape of that place because of the loner’s residence, anyone who came across Daniel and the monkey at that time would get scared to death. Daniel, extremely thin and tall, had a dreary mien to him. The hair of his beard and head, grown in abundance, made his head even larger than it was. Hatless it was a truly satanic head.",CO013CL11
13563,700,"Caligula, who on other days was an ordinary monkey, took, in those hours of nocturnal walk, a mien as gloomy and mysterious as Daniel’s.",CO013CL11
13564,701,"It had been an hour since the two loners had left the house. The house was a little far away. Nothing more natural than the police arriving on this occasion, take the entrance to the house, and solve the mystery. But the police, despite the means at their disposal, didn’t dare to investigate the mystery which the people regarded as diabolical.",CO013CL11
13565,702,"The police are also human, and nothing that is human is unknown to them. It had been an hour, I said, that the two walkers had left the house. Then they started to climb a little hill…",CO013CL11
13566,703,Tito was interrupted by a yawn from old Diogo.,CO013CL11
13567,704,“Do you want to sleep?” asked the young man.,CO013CL11
13568,705,“That’s what I’m going to do.”,CO013CL11
13569,706,“But the story?”,CO013CL11
13570,707,"“The story is so much fun. So far we have seen only two things, a man and a monkey; forgive me… we have two more, a monkey and a man. It’s so much fun! But for a change, the man will leave and the monkey stays.”",CO013CL11
13571,708,"Saying these words with a comic rage, Diogo took up his hat and left.",CO013CL11
13572,709,Tito laughed out loud.,CO013CL11
13573,710,“But let’s get to the end of the story…”,CO013CL11
13574,711,"“What end, my lady? I was already in trouble for not knowing how to continue… It was a way to be at your service. I see he’s a boring old man…”",CO013CL11
13575,712,"“He’s not, you’re wrong.”",CO013CL11
13576,713,“Ah! No?”,CO013CL11
13577,714,"“I have fun with him. Which doesn’t prevent your presence from giving me infinite pleasure, sir…”",CO013CL11
13578,715,“Your Excellency has now pronounced a falsehood.”,CO013CL11
13579,716,“What was it?”,CO013CL11
13580,717,"“You said that my conversation was agreeable to you. Now, this is as false as all that is false…”",CO013CL11
13581,718,“Do you want a compliment?”,CO013CL11
13582,719,"“No, I say it frankly. I don’t know how Your Excellency tolerates me; blunt, dull, jocular, with no faith in anything, I am a very unworthy conversationalist. It takes a great amount of kindness to have such benevolent expressions… so friendly…”",CO013CL11
13583,720,"“Leave that mocking mode, and…”",CO013CL11
13584,721,"“Mocking, my lady?”",CO013CL11
13585,722,“Yesterday my aunt and I had tea alone! Alone!...”,CO013CL11
13586,723,“Ah!”,CO013CL11
13587,724,“I was hoping you’d bore yourself for an hour with us…”,CO013CL11
13588,725,“What a bore… I tell you: Ernesto was the culprit.”,CO013CL11
13589,726,“Ah! Was it him?”,CO013CL11
13590,727,"“It’s true; he found me at home with some friends, there were four of us, we talked about voltarete and we ended up starting a game of cards. Ah! But it was a full night! What happened to me always happened to me: I won!”",CO013CL11
13591,728,“That’s good.”,CO013CL11
13592,729,"“Well, look, still I wasn’t playing with amateurs; they were masters of prime strength: one mainly; until eleven o’clock fortune seemed to disfavor me, but from there onwards it turned the wheel against them and I began to terrify… you may be sure that I terrified them. Ah! It’s just that I have a degree… but what is this, are you crying?”",CO013CL11
13593,730,"Emília had indeed the handkerchief in her eyes. Was she crying? Admittedly, when he took the handkerchief from her eyes, it was moistened. She turned against the light and said to the young man:",CO013CL11
13594,731,“What… you can go on.”,CO013CL11
13595,732,"“There’s nothing else. That was all,” Tito said.",CO013CL11
13596,733,“I hope the night made you happy…”,CO013CL11
13597,734,“Something…”,CO013CL11
13598,735,"“But to a letter, one answers. Why didn’t you answer mine?” said the widow.",CO013CL11

13600,737,“The letter I wrote to you asking to come and have tea with us?”,CO013CL11

13605,742,“Won’t you invite me over for tea anymore?”,CO013CL11
13606,743,"“No, you can risk missing better distractions.”",CO013CL11
13607,744,"“I don’t say that: you treat us well, and the hours are well spent in your house… That is said frankly. But then, did you have tea alone? What about Diogo?”",CO013CL11
13608,745,“I got rid of him. Do you think he’s fun?”,CO013CL11
13609,746,"“He seems to be… He’s a delicate man; a bit given to passions, it’s true, but this being a common fault, I think that in him it’s not very worthy of censure.”",CO013CL11

13616,753,“Not at all.”,CO013CL11

13619,756,"“I speak my soul,” said the widow.",CO013CL11

13682,819,"“Goodbye, see you tomorrow. Have rosy dreams, and excuse my bad moods. See you tomorrow.”",CO013CL11

13685,822,"The next day, at noon, Diogo visited Tito, and after talking about different things, he took from his pocket a little letter, which he had pretended to have forgotten until then, and to which he didn’t show much appreciation.",CO013CL11
13686,823,"“What a bomb!” he said to himself, at the time Tito tore the envelope.",CO013CL11
13687,824,This is what the letter said:,CO013CL11
13688,825,“I gave you my heart. You didn’t want to accept it; you actually scorned it. Your boot has hurt it too much for it to throb anymore. It’s dead. I don’t blame you; one should not speak of light to the blind; I was the one to blame. I supposed I could give you happiness by getting it back. I was wrong.,CO013CL11
13689,826,"“You have the glory of retreating with all the honors of war. I’m the loser. Well, what can I do! You can make fun of me; I don’t dispute your right to do so.",CO013CL11
13690,827,"“However, I must tell you that I knew you well; I never told you, but I knew you; from the day I first saw you at Adelaide’s house, I recognized in you the same man who once came to throw himself at my feet… It was a mockery then, as it is today. I should have known you by now. I paid dearly for my mistake. Goodbye, goodbye forever.”",CO013CL11
13691,828,"Reading this letter, Tito looked at Diogo again and again. How had the old man lent himself to that? Was such a letter authentic or apocryphal? Besides not being signed, it had a disguised handwriting. Was it a weapon the old man had used to dispose of the young man? But, if that were so, he would have to know what had happened the day before.",CO013CL11
13692,829,"Tito read the letter over many times; and saying goodbye to the old man, he told him that the answer would come later.",CO013CL11
13693,830,"Diogo withdrew, happily rubbing his hands together.",CO013CL11
13694,831,"It’s that the letter whose readers read along with our hero wasn’t the one Emília had read to Diogo. In the draft presented to the old man, the widow declared simply that she was retiring to the Court, and added that among the memories she carried from Petrópolis was Tito, for the character he had played before her. But this draft, by a purely feminine dexterity, wasn’t the one Emília sent to Tito, as the readers saw.",CO013CL11
13695,832,To Emília’s letter Tito answered in the following terms:,CO013CL11
13696,833,"“My lady,",CO013CL11
13697,834,"“I read and reread your letter; and I won’t conceal the feeling of sorrow which it inspired in me. Really, my lady, is that the state of your heart? Are you so lost for me?",CO013CL11
13698,835,"“Your Excellency says that with my boot I have injured your heart. The fact penalizes me, however I cannot confirm it. I don’t recall that to this day I had done any damage of this nature. But, finally, Your Excellency says so, and I must believe it.",CO013CL11
13699,836,"“Reading this letter, Your Excellency will tell herself that I’m the most daring gentleman who has ever trod the land of Santa Cruz. It will be a mistake of observation. This in me isn’t audacity, it’s frankness. I’m sorry things got to this point, but I cannot tell you anything but the truth.",CO013CL11
13700,837,"“I must confess that I don’t know if the letter to which I’m answering comes from Your Excellency. Your handwriting, of which I have already seen a sample on Mrs. Adelaide’s album, doesn’t resemble the one in the letter; is evidently disguised; it’s from any hand. Moreover, there’s no signature.",CO013CL11
13701,838,"“I say this because the first doubt that was born in my spirit came from the chosen carrier. Why! Your Excellency didn’t find any other than Diogo himself? I confess that from everything I’ve seen in my life, this is what makes me laugh the most.",CO013CL11
13702,839,"“But I must not laugh, ma’am. Your Excellency has opened your heart to me in a way that inspires compassion instead. This compassion isn’t inelegant toward you, because it doesn’t come from an ironic sense. It’s pure and sincere. I feel I cannot give you this happiness you ask from me; but that’s the way it is.",CO013CL11
13703,840,"“I must not extend myself, and yet it’s difficult for me to pluck the pen from the paper. It’s that few will have the position that I occupy now, the position of the requested. But I must end and end here, sending you my condolences and praying to God that you find a heart less cold than mine.",CO013CL11
13704,841,"“The letter goes disguised as yours, and; as in your letter, I leave the signature blank.”",CO013CL11
13705,842,This letter was delivered to the widow the same afternoon. At night Azevedo and Adelaide went to visit her. They could not dissuade her from the idea of the trip to the Court.,CO013CL11
13706,843,"Emília even used a certain reserve toward Adelaide, who couldn’t uncover the reasons for such a procedure, and withdrew somewhat sadly.",CO013CL11
13707,844,"The next day, Emília and her aunt got ready to go back to the Court.",CO013CL11
13708,845,"Diogo still stayed in Petrópolis, taking care of packing his bags… He didn’t want, he said, that the public, watching him go with the two ladies, should assume shameful things of the widow.",CO013CL11
13709,846,"All these steps amazed Adelaide, who, as I said, saw in Emília’s insistence and reserved manners a secret she didn’t understand.",CO013CL11
13710,847,"Did she want to attract Tito with that trip? In that case it was a wrong calculation; since the young man, on that day like the others, woke up late and happily had lunch.",CO013CL11
13711,848,"“You know,” said Adelaide, “that our friend Emília must have left for the city by this hour?”",CO013CL11
13712,849,“I had already heard of it.”,CO013CL11
13713,850,“I wonder why?”,CO013CL11

13715,852,"At the end of lunch Tito, as usual, retired to read for two hours.",CO013CL11
13716,853,"Adelaide was about to give some orders when she saw with amazement the widow, accompanied by a servant, come into her house.",CO013CL11
13717,854,“Ah! Didn’t you leave?” said Adelaide running to hug her.,CO013CL11
13718,855,“Can you not see me here?”,CO013CL11
13719,856,The servant went out at a sign from Emília.,CO013CL11
13720,857,"“But what is it?” asked Azevedo’s wife, seeing the widow’s strange manners.",CO013CL11
13721,858,“What is it?” the other said. “There’s what we didn’t anticipate… You’re almost my sister… I can speak frankly. Can anyone hear us?”,CO013CL11
13722,859,“Ernesto is out and Tito is upstairs. But what look is this?”,CO013CL11
13723,860,"“Adelaide!” said Emília, her eyes wet with tears, “I love him!”",CO013CL11
13724,861,“What are you telling me?”,CO013CL11
13725,862,"“That’s right. I love him madly, hopelessly, completely. I have tried so far to overcome this passion, but I couldn’t; and when, for vain prejudice, I tried to hide the state of my heart, I couldn’t, the words left my lips insensibly…”",CO013CL11
13726,863,“But how did this happen?”,CO013CL11
13727,864,"“I know! It seems that it was a punishment; I wanted to make a fire and I burned myself in the same flames. Ah! It’s not from today that I feel like this. Ever since his disdain didn’t give way, I began to feel I don’t know what; at first spite, then a desire to triumph, then an ambition to give everything up, as long as I won everything; I wasn’t my own master after all. It was I who felt madly in love and expressed it, by gestures, by words, by everything; and the more indifference grew in him, the more love grew in me.”",CO013CL11
13728,865,“But are you serious?”,CO013CL11
13729,866,“Look at me first.”,CO013CL11
13730,867,“Who would have thought?”,CO013CL11
13731,868,“It seems impossible to me; but it’s more than true…”,CO013CL11
13732,869,“And him?…”,CO013CL11
13733,870,"“He told me four indifferent words, I don’t know what they were, and he left.”",CO013CL11
13734,871,“Will you resist?”,CO013CL11
13735,872,“I don’t know.”,CO013CL11
13736,873,"“If I had guessed this, I wouldn’t have insinuated you into that ill-fated idea.”",CO013CL11
13737,874,"“You didn’t understand me. Do you think I deplore what is happening? Oh! No! I feel happy, I feel proud… It’s one of these loves that sprout on its own to fill your soul with satisfaction: I must first bless you…”",CO013CL11
13738,875,“It’s a real passion… But do you believe it’s impossible to convert him?”,CO013CL11
13739,876,"“I don’t know; but whether or not it’s impossible, it’s not the conversion that I ask for;",CO013CL11
13740,877,it’s enough for me that he’s less indifferent and more compassionate.”,CO013CL11
13741,878,"“But what are you going to do?” asked Adelaide, feeling tears also coming up in her eyes.",CO013CL11
13742,879,There was a moment of silence.,CO013CL11
13743,880,"“But what you don’t know,” continued Emília, “is that he isn’t a simple stranger to me. I knew him before I was married. It was he who asked me for marriage before Rafael…”",CO013CL11
13744,881,“Ah!”,CO013CL11
13745,882,“Did you know?”,CO013CL11
13746,883,"“He had already told me the story, but he had not named the saint. Was that you?”",CO013CL11
13747,884,“It was me. We both knew each other without saying anything to each other…”,CO013CL11
13748,885,“Why?”,CO013CL11
13749,886,"The answer to this question was given by Tito himself, who had come to the door from outside. Having seen from one of the windows the widow coming in, Tito came downstairs to hear her conversation with Adelaide. The strangeness of Emília’s unexpected return could excuse the young man’s indiscretion.",CO013CL11
13750,887,“Why?” he repeated. “That’s what I’m going to tell you.”,CO013CL11
13751,888,"“But first of all,” said Adelaide, “I don’t know if you know that such indifference, as whole as yours, can be fatal to the least indifferent?”",CO013CL11
13752,889,“You mean your friend?” asked Tito. “I cut everything with one word.”,CO013CL11
13753,890,"And turning to Emília, he said, holding out his hand:",CO013CL11
13754,891,“Do you accept my hand as husband?”,CO013CL11
13755,892,"A cry of supreme joy came from Emília’s chest; but I don’t know whether a remnant of pride or any other sentiment has converted this manifestation into a simple word, which in fact was pronounced with tears in her voice:",CO013CL11
13756,893,“Yes!” she said.,CO013CL11
13757,894,Tito kissed the widow’s hand lovingly. Then he added:,CO013CL11
13758,895,“But all my generosity must be measured; I should say: I accept your hand. Should I or shouldn’t I? I’m a bit original and I like to invert it all.”,CO013CL11
13759,896,"“Yes, yes; but one way or the other I am happy. Yet remorse comes into my consciousness. Do I give you happiness as complete as I get?”",CO013CL11
13760,897,"“Remorse? If you’re subject to remorse you must have one, but for a different reason. You are facing the music at this moment. I’ve made you suffer, haven’t I? Hearing what I’m about to say will agree that I have suffered before, and more.”",CO013CL11
13761,898,“Do we have a novel?” Adelaide asked Tito.,CO013CL11
13762,899,"“Reality, my lady,” replied Tito, “and reality in prose. One day, some years ago, I had the happiness of seeing a lady, and I loving her. Love was all the more indomitable for having been born in me suddenly. It was then more ardent than today, it didn’t know the manners of the world very much. I decided to declare my passion and ask her to marry me. I had this note in response…”",CO013CL11
13763,900,"“I know,” said Emília. “This lady was me. I am humiliated; forgive me!”",CO013CL11
13764,901,“My love forgives you; I never stopped loving you. I was sure to meet you one day and proceeded to make myself the desired one.”,CO013CL11
13765,902,"“Write this down and say it’s a novel,” Adelaide said cheerfully.",CO013CL11
13766,903,"“Life is nothing else,” added Tito.",CO013CL11
13767,904,"A half hour later, Azevedo entered. Astonished with Emília’s presence when she was supposed to be riding on the train; and even more astonished at the cordial manner in which Tito and Emília were concerned, Adelaide’s husband inquired as to the reason.",CO013CL11
13768,905,"“The reason is simple,” replied Adelaide; “Emília has returned because she’s going to marry Tito.”",CO013CL11
13769,906,Azevedo wasn’t satisfied; they explained everything to him.,CO013CL11
13770,907,"“I see,” he said. “Tito having reached nothing by walking in a straight line, tried to see if he got somewhere walking along a curved line. Sometimes it’s the shortest way.”",CO013CL11
13771,908,"“Like now,” added Tito.",CO013CL11
13772,909,Emília ate at Adelaide’s. In the afternoon old Diogo appeared there; he was going to say goodbye because he was to leave for the Court the following day in the morning. Great was his admiration when he saw the widow.,CO013CL11
13773,910,“You came back?”,CO013CL11
13774,911,"“That’s true,” said Emília, laughing.",CO013CL11
13775,912,"“I was leaving, but I’m not leaving anymore. Ah! I received a letter from Europe: it was the captain of the galley Macedonia that brought it! The bear has arrived!”",CO013CL11
13776,913,"“Go and keep him company,” said Tito.",CO013CL11
13777,914,"Diogo winced. Then, as he wished to know the reason for the widow’s sudden return, she explained that she was going to marry Tito.",CO013CL11
13778,915,Diogo didn’t believe it.,CO013CL11
13779,916,"“It’s still a bond, isn’t it?” he said, blinking his eyes.",CO013CL11

A few readers may even know some of the characters who will appear in this brief portrait. It wouldn’t be so very odd if, tomorrow, on meeting, say, Azevedo, one of my readers might exclaim:",CO013CL10

13788,5,"He’s a happy man, Azevedo! At the moment when this story begins, he is a happy husband, entirely happy. Just married, possessed of a wife who was the most beautiful woman in Petrópolis society, and possessed, too, of the kindest heart to be found beneath the sun of the Americas, the owner of a couple of well-situated and eminently rentable properties, respected, loved, and untroubled, that is our Azevedo, who, to complete his great good fortune, is a handsome, healthy twenty-six-year-old.",CO013CL10
13789,6,"Fortune has also given him a very easy job—doing nothing. He has a degree in law, but has never made any use of it; it’s still in the classic tin box in which he brought it from the University of São Paulo. He would occasionally revisit his degree certificate, but only very rarely, and then not again until another long period of time had elapsed. It’s not so much a certificate as a relic.",CO013CL10

13791,8,"He arrived in Rio with the firm intention of taking a berth on the first steamer available, but not everything depends on the will of man. Before embarking, Azevedo went to a dance, and awaiting him there was the net in which he would be caught. And what a net! Twenty years old, a slim, frail, delicate figure, one of those insubstantial creatures who seems to dissolve in the first light of day. Azevedo could not help himself; he fell passionately in love; a month later, he was married, and a week after that, the couple left for Petrópolis.",CO013CL10
13792,9,"What house would be home to that handsome, loving, happy couple? The house they chose could not have been more appropriate; it was a light, slender, elegant affair, more of a holiday home than a permanent dwelling; a real little love nest for those two fugitive doves.",CO013CL10
13793,10,"Our story begins exactly three months after their departure to Petrópolis. Azevedo and his wife were still as deeply in love as they had been on the first day. Then love took on a new and far greater importance, for—dare I say it, O couples who have only been married for three months—their first child had already appeared on the horizon. And both heaven and earth rejoice when the first ray of sun appears on the horizon. I am not using this image for purely stylistic reasons, it is simply a logical deduction.

I tried to find out where you were living and was told that you were in Petrópolis temporarily. I rested a little, then, today, I took the boat from Prainha and here I am. I suspected that a poetic soul like you would want to hide your happiness away in some secret corner of the world. And this really is a little piece of paradise. A garden, pergolas, a light, elegant house, a book. Love poetry too. Bravo! Perfect! Tityre, tu patulae recubans . . . I have stumbled upon an idyll.

13840,57,"“I was just saying to Adelaide that it seems to me more like three minutes,” added Azevedo.",CO013CL10
13841,58,"Tito looked at them, smiling, and said:",CO013CL10
13842,59,"“Three months or three minutes! There you have the whole truth about life. If you were laid upon a gridiron, like Saint Lawrence, five minutes would seem like five months. And yet still we talk of time. What is time, after all? It’s a matter of how we experience it. Months for the unhappy and minutes for the happy!”",CO013CL10
13843,60,"“And what happiness, eh?” cried Azevedo.",CO013CL10
13844,61,"“Complete and utter bliss, I imagine. Husband to a seraph, in mind and heart, ah, I’m sorry, I forgot you were there, Adelaide . . . but don’t blush. You’ll hear me say the same thing twenty times a day. I always say what I think. You must be the envy of all our friends.”",CO013CL10
13845,62,“I have no idea.”,CO013CL10
13846,63,"“Of course not. How could you, secluded as you are in this little hideaway of yours? And you’re quite right. Being happy in full view of everyone else would mean sharing your happiness, and out of respect for that principle, I really should leave . . .”",CO013CL10
13847,64,"And, saying this, Tito stood up.",CO013CL10
13848,65,“Stop talking and stay with us.”,CO013CL10
13849,66,"“True friends are also true happiness,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10
13850,67,“Ah!”,CO013CL10
13851,68,"“It might be good for you to spend a little time at our school and learn the science of marriage,” said Azevedo.",CO013CL10
13852,69,"“Whatever for?” asked Tito, brandishing his whip.",CO013CL10
13853,70,“In order to get married.”,CO013CL10
13854,71,"“Hm,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
13855,72,“Don’t you want to?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL10
13856,73,"“So you haven’t changed your mind, then?”",CO013CL10
13857,74,"“No,” answered Tito.",CO013CL10
13858,75,Adelaide looked curious and asked:,CO013CL10
13859,76,“Do you have a horror of marriage?”,CO013CL10
13860,77,"“I simply have no vocation for it,” said Tito. “And it is purely a matter of vocation. If you don’t have it, don’t do it, it’s a complete waste of time and fatal for one’s peace of mind. That has been my belief for a long time now.”",CO013CL10
13861,78,“Your time has perhaps not yet come.”,CO013CL10
13862,79,"“And it never will,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
13863,80,"“I seem to remember,” said Azevedo, offering his friend a cigar, “that there was a day when you tossed aside your usual theories and fell deeply in love.”",CO013CL10
13864,81,“I would hardly describe it as ‘deeply in love.’ Providence did one day provide me with confirmation of my solitary instincts. I began courting a young lady . . .”,CO013CL10
13865,82,"“Oh, yes, it was a funny business.”",CO013CL10
13866,83,“What happened?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL10
13867,84,"“Tito went to a dance and saw a young woman. The next day, he went to her house and, just like that, asked for her hand in marriage. She said . . . what was it she said, now?”",CO013CL10
13868,85,"“She wrote me a note saying that I was a fool and should leave her alone. She didn’t actually use the word ‘fool,’ but it came to the same thing. Needless to say, that wasn’t the response I was hoping for. Anyway, I turned tail and have never been in love since.”",CO013CL10
13869,86,“But were you in love on that occasion?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL10
13870,87,"“I don’t know if it was love,” answered Tito, “it was something . . . But that was a good five years ago. Since then I haven’t met anyone who made my heart beat faster.”",CO013CL10
13871,88,“So much the worse for you.”,CO013CL10
13872,89,"“I know,” said Tito with a shrug. “But then, while I may not have enjoyed the private pleasures of love, I at least haven’t endured the miseries or the disappointments. And that is a great good fortune.”",CO013CL10
13873,90,"“True love knows nothing of such things,” said Adelaide sententiously.",CO013CL10
13874,91,"“Really? Look, let’s change the subject, shall we? I could deliver a speech on the matter, but I prefer—”",CO013CL10
13875,92,"“You must stay here with us,” Azevedo broke in. “That’s decided.”",CO013CL10
13876,93,"“No, I can’t . . .”",CO013CL10
13877,94,“You can and must stay.”,CO013CL10
13878,95,“But I’ve already told my manservant to get me a room at the Hotel de Bragança . . .”,CO013CL10
13879,96,"“Well, tell him otherwise, and stay here.”",CO013CL10
13880,97,“I don’t want to disturb your peace.”,CO013CL10
13881,98,“But you won’t.”,CO013CL10
13882,99,“Stay!” said Adelaide.,CO013CL10
13883,100,"“All right, I’ll stay.”",CO013CL10
13884,101,"“And tomorrow,” said Adelaide, “once you’ve rested, you must tell us the secret of this independence of mind you’re so proud of.”",CO013CL10
13885,102,"“It’s no secret,” said Tito. “It’s this: given the choice between love and a game of ombre, I don’t think twice, I always choose ombre. By the way, Ernesto, I met an amazing player of ombre in Chile. He played the boldest gascarola I’ve ever seen . . . Do you know what a gascarola is, senhora?”",CO013CL10
13886,103,"“No,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10
13887,104,"“Well, I’ll explain.”",CO013CL10
13888,105,Azevedo glanced to one side and said:,CO013CL10
13889,106,"“Ah, here’s Emília.”",CO013CL10
13890,107,There at the garden gate was a lady arm in arm with an older man of about fifty.,CO013CL10
13891,108,"Dona Emília was what one might call a beautiful woman; she was lofty in stature and lofty in nature too. She was the kind of woman who would impose from on high any feelings of love she might inspire. Her manners and her graces gave her a rather queenly air, which made one feel like leading her to a throne.",CO013CL10
13892,109,"She dressed simply but elegantly, a natural elegance that was quite different from being overdressed; indeed, I once came up with this maxim: “There are the elegantly dressed and there are the overdressed.”",CO013CL10
13893,110,"Her main points of beauty were her beautiful dark eyes, large and bright, her thick brown hair, her nose as straight as Sappho’s, her small red mouth, satin cheeks, and the neck and arms of a statue.",CO013CL10
13894,111,"As for the older man on her arm, he was, as I said, about fifty years old. He was what we call in Portuguese chão—vulgar and coarse, an old rake. Painted and corseted, he was like an ancient ruin rebuilt by modern hands, which gave him that in-between appearance, lacking both the austerity of old age and the freshness of youth. He had clearly been a handsome fellow in his day, but any conquests he may have made in the past would now be but faded memories.",CO013CL10
13895,112,"When Emília came into the garden, everyone was already on their feet. She shook Azevedo’s hand and went to kiss Adelaide on the cheek. She was just about to sit down in the chair Azevedo offered her, when she noticed Tito, who was standing slightly apart.",CO013CL10
13896,113,"They greeted each other rather stiffly. Tito seemed calm and coolly polite, and, afterward, Emília kept her eyes fixed on him, as if summoning up some past memory.",CO013CL10
13897,114,"Once the necessary introductions had been made, including Diogo Franco (the name of the old man on Emília’s arm), they all sat down.",CO013CL10
13898,115,The first to speak was Emília:,CO013CL10
13899,116,“I wouldn’t have come today if it hadn’t been for Senhor Diogo’s kindness.”,CO013CL10
13900,117,Adelaide looked at Diogo and said:,CO013CL10
13901,118,"“You’re a marvel, Senhor Diogo.”",CO013CL10
13902,119,Diogo drew himself up and murmured rather modestly:,CO013CL10
13903,120,"“No, really, it was nothing.”",CO013CL10
13904,121,"“Just wait until you hear. He’s not only one marvel, he’s two. Did you know, he’s going to give me a present?”",CO013CL10
13905,122,“A present!” said Azevedo.,CO013CL10
13906,123,"“Yes,” Emília went on, “a present he has ordered to be sent from the farthest-flung corners of Europe, a souvenir of his travels there as an adolescent . . .”",CO013CL10
13907,124,Diogo was positively radiant.,CO013CL10
13908,125,"“No, really, it’s a mere trifle,” he said, gazing tenderly at Emília.",CO013CL10
13909,126,“Whatever is it?” asked Adelaide.,CO013CL10
13910,127,“It is . . . can you guess? A white bear!”,CO013CL10
13911,128,“A white bear?”,CO013CL10
13912,129,“Really?”,CO013CL10
13913,130,"“It’s about to arrive, apparently, but he only told me about it yesterday. Isn’t that sweet?”",CO013CL10
13914,131,“A bear!” Azevedo said.,CO013CL10
13915,132,Tito leaned toward his friend and whispered in his ear:,CO013CL10
13916,133,“That will make two of them.”,CO013CL10
13917,134,"Overjoyed at this response to the news of his present, but quite wrong about the nature of that response, Diogo said:",CO013CL10
13918,135,"“No, really, it’s nothing. It’s just a bear, although I did ask for a truly beautiful one to be sent. You probably can’t imagine what a white bear looks like. It’s completely white, you know.”",CO013CL10
13919,136,“You don’t say!” said Tito.,CO013CL10
13920,137,“It’s a wonderful beast!” said Diogo.,CO013CL10
13921,138,"“I’m sure it is,” said Tito. “Just imagine that, a white bear that’s completely white.” Then, sotto voce, he asked Azevedo: “Who is this man?”",CO013CL10
13922,139,“He’s courting Emília; he’s fifty years old.”,CO013CL10
13923,140,“And what does she do about that?”,CO013CL10
13924,141,"“Oh, she just ignores him.”",CO013CL10
13925,142,“Is that what she says?”,CO013CL10
13926,143,"“Yes, and it’s true.”",CO013CL10
13927,144,"While they were talking, Diogo was playing with the fob-chain on his watch, and the two ladies were chatting. After that last exchange between Azevedo and Tito, Emília turned to Azevedo and asked:",CO013CL10
13928,145,"“Is it true, Senhor Azevedo, that you celebrate birthdays in this house and don’t invite me?”",CO013CL10
13929,146,"“But it was pouring with rain,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10
13930,147,“Ungrateful girl. You know perfectly well that rain doesn’t count as an excuse.”,CO013CL10
13931,148,"“Besides,” said Azevedo, “it was a very modest affair.”",CO013CL10
13932,149,"“Even so, I’m practically family!”",CO013CL10
13933,150,"“The thing is, they’re still on their honeymoon despite being married for five whole months,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
13934,151,"“And we’ll have none of your sarcasm, thank you,” said Azevedo.",CO013CL10
13935,152,"“That’s very naughty of you, Senhor Tito!”",CO013CL10
13936,153,“Tito?” Emília asked Adelaide quietly.,CO013CL10
13937,154,“Yes.”,CO013CL10
13938,155,"“Ah, Dona Emília doesn’t yet know about our friend Tito,” said Azevedo. “I’m almost afraid to tell her.”",CO013CL10
13939,156,“Is it so very bad?”,CO013CL10
13940,157,"“It might be,” said Tito casually.",CO013CL10
13941,158,“Very bad!” exclaimed Adelaide.,CO013CL10
13942,159,"“What is it, then?” asked Emília.",CO013CL10
13943,160,"“He is a man incapable of love,” Adelaide went on. “Indeed, he couldn’t be more indifferent to love. In short, he prefers, what was it, now? Oh, yes, he prefers a game of ombre to love.”",CO013CL10
13944,161,“Is that what he told you?” asked Emília.,CO013CL10
13945,162,"“And I would say it again,” said Tito. “But be assured, I say this not because of women, but because of myself. I believe that all women deserve my adoration, but I am so fashioned that all I can offer them is my disinterested esteem.”",CO013CL10
13946,163,Emília looked at him and said:,CO013CL10
13947,164,"“If that isn’t vanity, then it’s a disease.”",CO013CL10
13948,165,"“You’ll forgive me when I say that I believe it to be neither a disease nor vanity. It’s simply my nature: some people hate oranges, others hate love affairs; now, whether it’s the tough skin that’s the problem, I really don’t know, but that’s the way it is.”",CO013CL10
13949,166,"“He’s very hard, isn’t he?” said Emília, looking at Adelaide.",CO013CL10
13950,167,"“Me? Hard?” said Tito, getting up. “I’m as delicate as silk, a mere baby, a miracle of gentleness . . . It hurts me deeply to be so unlike other men and so impervious to amorous influences, but what can I do? It’s not my fault.”",CO013CL10
13951,168,"“Just you wait,” said Azevedo. “Time will change you.”",CO013CL10
13952,169,“But when? I’m already twenty-nine.”,CO013CL10
13953,170,“Twenty-nine?” said Emília.,CO013CL10
13954,171,"“Yes, I turned twenty-nine at Easter.”",CO013CL10
13955,172,“You don’t look it.”,CO013CL10
13956,173,“You’re most kind.”,CO013CL10
13957,174,"The conversation continued in this vein until dinner was announced. Emília and Diogo had already dined and only stayed in order to keep the Azevedos and Tito company, Tito declaring himself to be absolutely starving.",CO013CL10
13958,175,The conversation over dinner touched only on banal topics.,CO013CL10
13959,176,"When coffee was served, a servant arrived from the hotel where Diogo was staying; he brought with him a letter for Diogo, with a note on the envelope announcing that it was urgent. Diogo took the letter, read it, and seemed to turn pale, but he, nevertheless, continued to take part in the general conversation. This incident, though, prompted Adelaide to ask Emília:",CO013CL10
13960,177,"“When will your eternal inamorato ever set you free, do you think?”",CO013CL10
13961,178,"“I have no idea!” said Emília. “He’s not a bad man, but he’s got into the habit of telling me every week that he feels a burning passion for me.”",CO013CL10
13962,179,"“Well, if it’s only a weekly declaration . . .”",CO013CL10
13963,180,"“Yes, that’s all it is, and he does have the advantage of being an infallible companion whenever I go out and about and he’s a reliable hurdy-gurdy when at home, always churning out the same stories. He’s already described to me about fifty times the amorous battles he’s fought. His one wish is to travel around the world with me. If the subject comes up in the evening, as it usually does, I order some tea, which is an excellent way of cooling his ardor. He’s mad about tea, as mad as he is about me! But what do you make of that white bear? What if he really has sent for a bear?”",CO013CL10
13964,181,“You must accept it.”,CO013CL10
13965,182,“How I am going to feed a bear? As if I didn’t have enough to do!”,CO013CL10
13966,183,Adelaide smiled and said:,CO013CL10
13967,184,“It sounds to me as if you’ll end up falling in love . . .”,CO013CL10
13968,185,“Who with? The bear?”,CO013CL10
13969,186,"“No, with Diogo.”",CO013CL10
13970,187,"At this point, they were standing next to a window. Tito was sitting on the sofa, talking to Azevedo. Diogo was sunk in an armchair, deep in thought.",CO013CL10
13971,188,"Emília kept looking at Tito. After a pause, she said to Adelaide:",CO013CL10
13972,189,“What do you make of your husband’s friend? He seems dreadfully vain. He says he’s never been in love. Is that credible?”,CO013CL10
13973,190,“It might be true.”,CO013CL10
13974,191,“I don’t believe it for a moment. How can you be so naïve? He’s obviously pretending.”,CO013CL10
13975,192,“It’s true that I don’t know much about him.”,CO013CL10
13976,193,"“As for me, I seem to recognize that face . . . but I can’t remember where I know him from.”",CO013CL10
13977,194,"“He appears genuine enough, but to say what he said really is a bit much.”",CO013CL10
13978,195,“Of course . . .”,CO013CL10
13979,196,“What are you smiling at?”,CO013CL10
13980,197,"“He reminds me of another such man,” said Emília. “It was years ago now. He was always boasting about how he was immune to love. He used to say that, for him, women were like Chinese vases: he admired them, but nothing more. Poor man. He succumbed in less than a month. I saw him kiss the tips of my shoes, Adelaide . . . after which, I sent him packing.”",CO013CL10
13981,198,“What did you do?”,CO013CL10
13982,199,"“Oh, I can’t remember now. Our Lady of Cunning performed the miracle. I avenged our sex and laid low a proud man.”",CO013CL10
13983,200,“Well done.”,CO013CL10
13984,201,“He was not dissimilar to this gentleman. But let’s talk about more important matters. I’ve just received the latest fashion plates from France . . .”,CO013CL10
13985,202,“And what’s new?”,CO013CL10
13986,203,"“Oh, lots of things. I’ll send them to you tomorrow. There’s a really lovely new style of sleeve you must see. I’ve already ordered a few things to be made up for me in Rio. And there are loads of gorgeous traveling outfits.”",CO013CL10
13987,204,“There doesn’t seem much point in me ordering anything.”,CO013CL10
13988,205,“Why?”,CO013CL10
13989,206,“I hardly leave the house.”,CO013CL10
13990,207,"“What, not even to dine with me on New Year’s Day?”",CO013CL10
13991,208,"“Oh, I wouldn’t miss that!”",CO013CL10
13992,209,"“Well, come, then, and what about this man, Senhor Tito?”",CO013CL10
13993,210,“If he’s still here and if you’d like him to come . . .”,CO013CL10
13994,211,"“Yes, let him come, why not? I’ll keep him on a very short rein. I don’t think he can always be so . . . uncivil. I don’t know how you put up with him. He sets my nerves on edge!”",CO013CL10
13995,212,"“Oh, I don’t much care what he says.”",CO013CL10
13996,213,"“But doesn’t it make you indignant, the insulting way he talks about women?”",CO013CL10
13997,214,“Not really.”,CO013CL10
13998,215,"“You’re lucky, then.”",CO013CL10
13999,216,"“What do you expect me to do with a man who says such things? If I weren’t married, I might feel more indignant. If I were free, I might well do to him what you did to that other man. But as it is, I don’t honestly care . . .”",CO013CL10
14000,217,"“Not even when he says he would always choose a game of cards over love? Putting us lower down the ranks than the queen of spades! And the way he said it too! Such coolness, such indifference!”",CO013CL10
14001,218,“He really is very naughty!”,CO013CL10
14002,219,“He deserves to be punished.”,CO013CL10
14003,220,“He does. Why don’t you punish him?”,CO013CL10
14004,221,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO013CL10
14005,222,"“No, it’s not worth it.”",CO013CL10
14006,223,“You punished that other man.”,CO013CL10
14007,224,"“Yes, but it’s really not worth it.”",CO013CL10
14008,225,“Liar!”,CO013CL10
14009,226,“Why do you say that?”,CO013CL10
14010,227,“Because I can already see that you’re half tempted to carry out another act of revenge . . .”,CO013CL10
14011,228,“Me? No!”,CO013CL10
14012,229,"“Yes, why not? It’s not a crime . . .”",CO013CL10

14014,231,“Could you?”,CO013CL10
14015,232,“Could I?” said Emília with a look of wounded pride.,CO013CL10
14016,233,“Will he kiss the tips of your shoes?”,CO013CL10
14017,234,"Emília remained silent for a few moments, then, pointing with her fan at the neat little boots she was wearing, she added:",CO013CL10
14018,235,"“Yes, he’ll kiss these very boots.”",CO013CL10
14019,236,"Emília and Adelaide went over to join the men. Tito, who appeared to be deep in conversation with Azevedo, broke off their conversation to address them and Diogo, who was still plunged in thought.",CO013CL10
14020,237,"“What’s this, Senhor Diogo?” Tito asked. “Are you meditating?”",CO013CL10
14021,238,"“Ah, I’m sorry. I was distracted!”",CO013CL10
14022,239,"“Poor man,” Tito murmured to Azevedo.",CO013CL10
14023,240,"Then, turning to the ladies, he asked:",CO013CL10
14024,241,“Does my cigar bother you?”,CO013CL10
14025,242,"“Not at all,” said Emília.",CO013CL10
14026,243,“So I may continue to smoke?”,CO013CL10
14027,244,"“You may,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10
14028,245,"“It’s a bad habit, but it’s my only vice. When I smoke, it’s as if I were breathing in eternity. It lifts me up and I’m a changed man. Such a divine invention!”",CO013CL10
14029,246,"“They say it’s an excellent remedy for those disappointed in love,” said Emília in an insinuating tone.",CO013CL10

14064,281,"Tito, who had intended to spend the day visiting the town, was forced to remain in the house. He was the perfect guest, because whenever he felt he was in the way, he would discreetly withdraw, and when he wasn’t in the way, he became the most delightful of companions.",CO013CL10
14065,282,"Tito combined great joviality with great delicacy; he could make people laugh without ever resorting to impropriety. What’s more, he had just returned from a long and picturesque journey with the pockets of his memory (if you’ll allow me that image) stuffed with lively anecdotes. He had made the journey in a poetic rather than a dandyish spirit. He was an excellent observer and storyteller, two qualities so indispensable to the traveler, but which are, alas, all too rare. Most people who travel don’t know how to look or how to describe what they see.",CO013CL10
14066,283,"Tito had traveled all the way up the Pacific coast and had lived in Mexico, as well as several American states. He had then taken the steamer from New York to Europe. He had seen London and Paris. He had been to Spain, where he lived a kind of Figaro life, serenading modern-day Rosinas at their windows, and, as trophies, had brought back several ladies’ fans and mantillas. He then moved on to Italy and raised his spirit up to the heights of classical art.",CO013CL10
14067,284,"He saw the shadow of Dante in the streets of Florence; he saw the souls of the doges hovering nostalgically over the widowed waters of the Adriatic Sea; the land of Raphael, Virgil, and Michelangelo was for him a vibrant source of memories of the past and ideas for the future. He went to Greece, where he evoked the spirit of the lost generations who had imbued art and poetry with a fire that still glowed brightly down the dark centuries.",CO013CL10
14068,285,"Our hero traveled farther still, and saw everything with the eyes of one who knows how to look and described everything with the soul of one who knows how to tell a tale. Azevedo and Adelaide spent many a rapt hour.",CO013CL10
14069,286,"“All I know of love,” he would say, “is that it’s a four-letter word, euphonious enough, it’s true, but portending struggles and misfortunes. The love of fortunate lovers is full of happiness, because it has the virtue of not looking up at the stars in the sky, but contents itself with a few midnight feasts and the occasional excursion on horseback or by boat.”",CO013CL10
14070,287,"This was how Tito always spoke. Was he telling the truth, or was this merely the language of convention? Everyone believed the first hypothesis, because this chimed with Tito’s jovial, playful nature.",CO013CL10

14072,289,"The following day, however, proved kinder, and Tito took advantage of the good weather to visit that cheerful mountain resort. Azevedo and Adelaide decided to join him and ordered three of their own horses to be saddled up for that brief outing.",CO013CL10
14073,290,"On the way back, they called in to see Emília. The visit lasted only a few minutes. The lovely widow received them as graciously and courteously as a princess.

14074,291,"Diogo, who was in the process of making his hundredth declaration of love to Emília, and for whom Emília had just poured a cup of tea, did not view kindly the attentions showered on the visitor by the lady of his thoughts. For that and possibly other reasons, the aging Adonis listened very glumly to the conversation.",CO013CL10

14094,311,"Emília left, arm in arm with Diogo.",CO013CL10
14095,312,"The next day, Tito did indeed go to Emília’s house. She waited for him with some impatience, and since she did not know at what hour he would visit, she spent the whole day, from the morning on, waiting. Tito only deigned to appear at dusk.",CO013CL10
14096,313,"Emília lived with an old aunt of hers. She was a kind lady, a good friend to her niece, and entirely submissive to her will, which meant that Emília could rest assured that her aunt would always fall in with her every wish.",CO013CL10
14097,314,"There was no one else in the room that Tito was shown into. He therefore had more than enough time to examine it at his leisure. It was a small room, but furnished and decorated with great taste. Light, elegant, expensive furniture; four exquisite statuettes—copies of works by James Pradier—an Érard piano, and all arranged in a most interesting and lively way.",CO013CL10
14098,315,"Tito spent the first quarter of an hour examining the room and the objects filling it. This examination must have had a great influence on any study he might have wished to make of the young woman’s mind. Tell me how you live, and I’ll tell you who you are.",CO013CL10
14099,316,"That first quarter of an hour passed, and still not a soul appeared and not a sound was heard. Tito began to grow impatient. As we know, he could be somewhat blunt, despite his great delicacy, to which anyone who knew him would attest.",CO013CL10
14100,317,"It seems, though, that his bluntness, which he almost always exercised on Emília, was perhaps assumed rather than natural. What is certain is that, after half an hour had passed, Tito, irritated by the delay, muttered to himself:",CO013CL10
14101,318,“She’s having her revenge!”,CO013CL10
14102,319,"And, picking up the hat he had placed on a chair, he was just walking over to the door when he heard a rustle of silk. Looking up, he saw Emília entering the room.",CO013CL10

14106,323,"“There’s nothing to forgive. I’m sure some serious reason must have prevented you from coming down earlier. As for me, I have no need to ask forgiveness, either. I waited, grew tired of waiting, and would have come back on another occasion. All of which is perfectly normal.”",CO013CL10
14107,324,"Emília offered Tito a chair, then sat down on a sofa, and, apparently accepting his rebuff, she said:",CO013CL10

14132,349,“How?” Emília asked with some amazement.,CO013CL10
14133,350,"“By continuing to be the wife of your dead husband. If love ends in the grave, there hardly seems any point in seeking it out.”",CO013CL10

14146,363,"I’ll let you into a secret. I did once try to love someone; I threw every fiber of my being into it; I prepared myself to heap all my pride and all my hopes onto the object of my love. What a lesson it taught me! Having encouraged my hopes, the object of my love married someone else, who was no more handsome and no more loving than me.”",CO013CL10
14147,364,“What does that prove?” asked Emília.,CO013CL10
14148,365,“It proves that what can and does happen on a daily basis to others happened to me.”,CO013CL10

14162,379,“Look and learn.”,CO013CL10
14163,380,"“What, from the engraver?” asked Tito. “That’s not possible. I’ve seen living engravings. I’ve been the target for many arrows. They can riddle me all over, but I am strong as any Saint Sebastian. I stand firm and do not flinch.”",CO013CL10
14164,381,“Such pride!”,CO013CL10

14168,385,"“No, I love music,” answered Tito, staying where he was. “Although, when it comes to the exponents of music, I only like the good ones. Hearing someone play badly makes me want to see them hanged.”",CO013CL10
14169,386,Emília played the prelude to a symphony. Tito listened with close attention. She really did play divinely.,CO013CL10

14174,391,"At this point, Emília’s aunt came into the room. Emília introduced her to Tito. The conversation took on a more personal, more reserved tone; however, it did not last long, because Tito, suddenly snatching up his hat, announced that he had things to do.",CO013CL10
14175,392,“When will we see you again?”,CO013CL10

14207,424,"“It’s only a suspicion, of course, but she talks of nothing else. She asks me twenty times a day about you and your habits, about your past life and your opinions. As you can imagine, I can only say, ‘I don’t know,’ but I’m beginning to hate you, and you can hardly blame me.”",CO013CL10
14208,425,"“Is it my fault that she likes me? But, really, Senhor Diogo, there’s no need to worry. She doesn’t like me, and I don’t like her. Carry on regardless and be happy.”",CO013CL10
14209,426,"“Happy! If only I could be! But I don’t believe I can, I’m not made for happiness. Look, Senhor Tito, I love that woman as dearly as life itself. One look from her is worth more to me than a whole year of success and happiness. It’s because of her that I’ve let my business affairs go to pot. Did you not notice the other day that I received a most upsetting letter? Well, I’d lost a lawsuit. And all for what? For her!”",CO013CL10
14210,427,“Does she give you any encouragement?”,CO013CL10
14211,428,"“Oh, I don’t understand the girl! One day, she’s so sweet to me that I’m in seventh heaven; the next, her indifference is enough to plunge me into hell. Today, a smile; tomorrow, a look of disdain. She tells me off for not visiting her, and then, when I do visit, she takes about as much notice of me as she does of Ganymede—Ganymede is the name of a little dog I gave her. Yes, she cares as much about me as she does for that dog. She does it on purpose. The girl is a complete enigma.”",CO013CL10
14212,429,"“Well, I won’t be the one to solve it, Senhor Diogo. I wish you much happiness. Goodbye.”",CO013CL10
14213,430,"And the two men parted. Diogo continued on to Emília’s house, and Tito to Azevedo’s.",CO013CL10
14214,431,"Tito had just discovered that he was often in Emília’s thoughts, but this caused not the slightest commotion inside him. Why? We will find that out later on. What we must say, though, is that the same suspicions had arisen in Adelaide’s mind as in Diogo’s. Her close friendship with Emília allowed her to submit Emília to a frank interrogation and to receive an equally frank confession. On the day after the scene just described, Adelaide told Emília her thoughts.",CO013CL10
14215,432,Emília responded with a laugh.,CO013CL10
14216,433,"“I don’t understand you,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10
14217,434,"“It’s perfectly simple,” said Emília. “If you think me capable of falling in love with a friend of your husband’s, you’re wrong. No, I don’t love him. As I said to you when I first set eyes on him, I am determined to have him at my feet. In fact, if I remember rightly, you were the one who laid down that challenge, a challenge I accepted. I have to avenge our sex. It may be vanity on my part, but I believe I can do what no other woman has done.”",CO013CL10
14218,435,"“Ah, you cruel creature. So that’s it!”",CO013CL10
14219,436,“Absolutely.”,CO013CL10
14220,437,“Do you think it’s possible?”,CO013CL10
14221,438,“Why not?”,CO013CL10

14223,440,"“I know, but I won’t be defeated.”",CO013CL10
14224,441,"This conversation was interrupted by Azevedo, and Emília gestured to Adelaide to say nothing. It was agreed between them that not even Azevedo should know what was afoot. And Adelaide said nothing to her husband.",CO013CL10
14225,442,III,CO013CL10
14226,443,A week passed.,CO013CL10
14227,444,"As we have seen, Tito was exactly as he had been on the very first day. He went for walks, read, talked, and seemed blissfully unaware of the plots being woven about him. During that time, he made only two visits to Emília’s house, once with the Azevedos and once with Diogo.",CO013CL10
14228,445,"He was the same on both occasions—cold, indifferent, impassive. No look, however seductive or significant, could shake him; not even the idea that he was much in Emília’s thoughts could spark his interest.",CO013CL10
14229,446,"“If he really is incapable of love, why does he not at least engage in one of those amours de salon that so flatter men’s vanity?”",CO013CL10
14230,447,"This was a question that Emília put to herself, bewildered by the young man’s indifference. She could not understand how Tito could remain so icy cold when confronted by her charms. This, unfortunately, was how it was.",CO013CL10
14231,448,"Weary of working in vain, she decided to take a decisive step. She steered the conversation onto the sweet pleasures of marriage and bemoaned her widowed state. The Azevedos were, for her, the image of perfect conjugal bliss. She presented them to Tito as an incentive for anyone wishing to be happy on this earth. Neither thesis nor hypothesis, however, could thaw Tito’s coldness.",CO013CL10
14232,449,"Emília was playing a dangerous game. She had to decide between her desire to avenge her sex and what was proper for a woman in her position; she was, however, a proud creature; and while she was respectful of her own strict morality, she did not show the same degree of respect for the inconvenience that went hand in hand with preserving that moral code. Vanity had a prodigious influence over her. And so the lovely widow deployed all licit means to make Tito fall in love with her.",CO013CL10
14233,450,"But once he had fallen in love, what would she do? An idle question, since, once she had him at her feet, she would try to keep him kneeling there along with old Diogo. That would be the best possible trophy any proud beauty could aspire to.",CO013CL10
14234,451,"One morning, eight days after the scenes described in the previous chapter, Diogo appeared at the Azevedos’ house. They had just finished breakfast. Azevedo had gone up to his study to finish off some correspondence, and Adelaide was in the downstairs living room.",CO013CL10
14235,452,"Diogo entered, looking terribly sad, sadder than she had ever seen him before. She ran over to him.",CO013CL10
14236,453,“Whatever’s wrong?” she asked.,CO013CL10
14237,454,"“Ah, senhora, I am the most wretched of men!”",CO013CL10
14238,455,“But why? Come and sit down . . .”,CO013CL10
14239,456,"Diogo sat, or, rather, slumped down into the chair Adelaide offered him. She took a seat next to him and encouraged him to tell her his woes.",CO013CL10
14240,457,“What’s happened?”,CO013CL10
14241,458,"“Two misfortunes,” he said. “The first in the form of a verdict. I’ve lost yet another lawsuit, which is unfortunate, but it’s as nothing compared to—”",CO013CL10
14242,459,“You mean there’s something worse?”,CO013CL10
14243,460,"“Yes, the second misfortune came in the form of a letter.”",CO013CL10

14245,462,"“Yes, read this.”",CO013CL10
14246,463,"Diogo removed from his wallet a small pink letter, smelling of essence of magnolia.",CO013CL10
14247,464,Adelaide read the letter.,CO013CL10
14248,465,"When she had finished, Diogo asked:",CO013CL10
14249,466,“What do you make of that?”,CO013CL10
14250,467,"“I don’t understand,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10

14253,470,“It’s a letter to him.”,CO013CL10
14254,471,“Who?”,CO013CL10

14256,473,“Ah!”,CO013CL10
14257,474,"“I cannot tell you what I felt when I picked up that letter. I have never trembled before anything in my life, but when I read that, my head began to spin. It’s still spinning now. With every step I take, I feel as if I were about to faint.”",CO013CL10
14258,475,"“Don’t despair,” said Adelaide.",CO013CL10
14259,476,"“That is precisely why I have come here, in search of consolation, reassurance. I knew you were at home and hoped to find you alone. It’s such a shame that your estimable husband is still alive, because the greatest possible consolation would be for you to accept my poor, misunderstood heart.”",CO013CL10
14260,477,"“Fortunately, he’s still alive.”",CO013CL10
14261,478,Diogo uttered a sigh and said:,CO013CL10

14263,480,"Then, after a silence, he went on:",CO013CL10
14264,481,"“I had two reactions: one was to treat them both with utter scorn, but that would only give them still greater freedom and leave me racked with pain and humiliation; the second was to challenge him to a duel; that would be best, I’ll kill him or else—”",CO013CL10
14265,482,“Don’t talk like that.”,CO013CL10
14266,483,“It’s vital that one of us is crossed off the list of the living.”,CO013CL10
14267,484,“What if you’re mistaken?”,CO013CL10
14268,485,“But I’m not mistaken. I’m absolutely sure.”,CO013CL10
14269,486,“Sure about what?”,CO013CL10
14270,487,Diogo unfolded the letter and said:,CO013CL10
14271,488,"“Listen: If you have still not understood me then you must lack all insight. Remove your mask, and I will explain myself. I’ll be having tea alone this evening. The importunate Diogo will not be troubling me with his usual nonsense. Give me the pleasure of seeing you and admiring you. Emília.”",CO013CL10
14272,489,“Is that all?”,CO013CL10

14274,491,“When was the letter written?”,CO013CL10
14275,492,“Yesterday.”,CO013CL10
14276,493,"“Calm down. Can you keep a secret? I should not be telling you this, and I’m only doing so because you’re upset. I can guarantee that this letter is a trick. It’s a way of avenging the female sex, a way of making Tito fall in love. That’s all.”",CO013CL10
14277,494,Diogo trembled with joy.,CO013CL10
14278,495,“Really?” he asked.,CO013CL10
14279,496,"“Yes, it’s true, but remember, it’s a secret. As I said, I’m only telling you as a way of reassuring you. Don’t spoil our joke.”",CO013CL10

14282,499,"“Oh, what a weight off my mind! I promise you that your secret is safe with me. How very funny. I’m so glad I came to talk to you. Can I tell Dona Emília that I know all about it?”",CO013CL10
14283,500,“No!”,CO013CL10
14284,501,“So I’d better pretend to know nothing.”,CO013CL10

14309,526,“Me? Are you crazy?”,CO013CL10

If you have to choose between discreet prudence and blind trust, don’t hesitate, and let the former be your guide. What can you guarantee about Emília?",CO013CL10

14399,616,"Half an hour later, Tito went up to the study where Azevedo kept his books. He intended to read Saint Augustine’s Confessions.",CO013CL10
14400,617,“Why the sudden trip to Rio?” Azevedo asked his wife.,CO013CL10
14401,618,“Do you really want to know?”,CO013CL10
14402,619,“I do.”,CO013CL10
14403,620,"“All right, but it’s a secret. I don’t know for sure, but I think it’s a strategy.”",CO013CL10
14404,621,“A strategy? I don’t understand.”,CO013CL10
14405,622,“I’ll explain. It’s a way of ensnaring Tito.”,CO013CL10
14406,623,“Ensnaring?”,CO013CL10
14407,624,"“You’re very slow today! Yes, ensnaring him in the bonds of love . . .”",CO013CL10
14408,625,“Ah!”,CO013CL10
14409,626,"“Emília felt she had to do it. It’s just a joke. When he declares himself vanquished, she will be avenged for what he said about the female sex.”",CO013CL10
14410,627,"“Not bad . . . And you’re part of this strategy, are you?”",CO013CL10
14411,628,“Only in an advisory capacity.”,CO013CL10
14412,629,"“So you’re plotting against my friend, my alter ego.”",CO013CL10
14413,630,"“Now, now, don’t say a word. You don’t want to ruin the plan.”",CO013CL10
14414,631,Azevedo laughed long and loud. He was amused by this premeditated punishment of poor Tito.,CO013CL10
14415,632,The visit Tito had said he was due to make to Emília that day did not happen.,CO013CL10
14416,633,"However, knowing Emília’s intentions, Diogo had gone immediately to her house to await Tito’s arrival, and there he spent the whole day, in vain: in vain he dined, in vain he spent the entire afternoon boring Emília and her aunt, and still Tito did not appear.",CO013CL10
14417,634,"That evening, however, when Diogo, bored with waiting at Emília’s house, was just about to leave, Tito’s presence was announced.",CO013CL10
14418,635,"Emília trembled, but this went unnoticed by Diogo.",CO013CL10
14419,636,"Tito entered the room where Emília, her aunt, and Diogo were all sitting.",CO013CL10
14420,637,"“I wasn’t expecting you,” Emília said.",CO013CL10
14421,638,“That’s the way I am. I arrive when least expected. I’m like death or a win on the lottery.”,CO013CL10
14422,639,"“Tonight, you’re a win on the lottery,” said Emília.",CO013CL10
14423,640,“And what number is your ticket?”,CO013CL10
14424,641,"“Number twelve, for the twelve hours I’ve had the pleasure of Senhor Diogo’s company today.”",CO013CL10
14425,642,"“Twelve hours!” exclaimed Tito, turning to Diogo.",CO013CL10
14426,643,“And our good friend has yet to tell us a single story . . .”,CO013CL10
14427,644,“Twelve hours!” Tito said again.,CO013CL10
14428,645,"“And what’s so astonishing about that, sir?” asked Diogo.",CO013CL10
14429,646,“It does seem rather a long time.”,CO013CL10
14430,647,"“One only counts the hours when one is bored . . . With your permission, I will withdraw . . .”",CO013CL10
14431,648,"And, saying this, Diogo picked up his hat to leave, shooting a look of jealous scorn at Emília.",CO013CL10
14432,649,“Why?” she asked. “Where are you going?”,CO013CL10
14433,650,"“I am lending wings to the hours,” Diogo whispered into Emília’s ear. “They will pass quickly now.”",CO013CL10
14434,651,“I forgive you and ask you to sit down again.”,CO013CL10
14435,652,Diogo did as asked.,CO013CL10
14436,653,"Emília’s aunt begged to be excused for a few moments, leaving only the three of them.",CO013CL10
14437,654,"“So,” said Tito, “he didn’t tell you a single story.”",CO013CL10
14438,655,“Not one.”,CO013CL10
14439,656,"Emília glanced at Diogo as if to reassure him. Feeling calmer now, Diogo remembered what Adelaide had told him and immediately cheered up.",CO013CL10
14440,657,"“After all,” he thought, “the joke’s on him. I am merely the means to entrap him. Let’s all play our part in pulling the rug from under his feet.”",CO013CL10
14441,658,"“Not a single story,” Emília said again.",CO013CL10
14442,659,"“Oh, I know plenty of stories,” said Diogo insinuatingly.",CO013CL10
14443,660,"“Then tell us one of those many stories,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
14444,661,“Certainly not! Why don’t you tell us one?”,CO013CL10
14445,662,“If you insist . . .”,CO013CL10
14446,663,"“Oh, I do, I do,” said Diogo, blinking. “Tell us one about jilted bridegrooms, or love’s deceits, or hardened voyagers. Go on!”",CO013CL10
14447,664,"“No, I’m going to tell you a story about a man and a monkey.”",CO013CL10
14448,665,"“Oh,” said Emília.",CO013CL10
14449,666,"“It’s very interesting,” said Tito. “Listen.”",CO013CL10
14450,667,"“Forgive me,” said Emília, “but let’s have tea first.”",CO013CL10
14451,668,“Of course.”,CO013CL10
14452,669,"Tea was served shortly afterward, and when it was over, Tito began his story:",CO013CL10
14453,670,STORY OF A MAN AND A MONKEY,CO013CL10
14454,671,"About twenty years ago, not far from the town of *** in the interior of Brazil, there lived a thirty-five-year-old man, whose mysterious life was the subject of much gossip in the surrounding towns and a source of terror to any travelers who happened along the road that passed only a few feet from his house.",CO013CL10
14455,672,"The house itself was enough to strike fear into the least timid of hearts. Seen from a distance, it was built so close to the ground that it did not even resemble a house. However, anyone who dared to go closer would see that half of the building was above ground level and half below. While it was very solidly built, it had neither doors nor windows, only a square opening that served as both window and door, through which the mysterious inhabitant came and went.",CO013CL10
14456,673,"Few people saw him leave, not just because he rarely did leave, but because he left at very strange times of day. This solitary individual only left his house to go roaming around when the moon was full. He always took with him a large monkey, who answered to the name Caligula.",CO013CL10
14457,674,"Monkey and man, man and monkey, were inseparable friends, inside the house and out, when the moon was new.",CO013CL10
14458,675,People had many theories about this mysterious man.,CO013CL10
14459,676,"The most widely held theory was that he was a wizard. According to another, he was crazy, and yet another held that he was merely a misanthrope.",CO013CL10
14460,677,"This last theory was supported by two facts: first, there was no positive evidence to indicate that the man ever behaved like a wizard or a madman; second, there was his avowed friendship with the monkey and his horror of being seen by other men. Whenever we begin to loathe mankind, we always grow fonder of animals, who have the advantage of neither talking too much nor intriguing against us.",CO013CL10
14461,678,"This mysterious man . . . Wait, we need to give him a name: let’s call him Daniel. Well, Daniel preferred the company of the monkey and spoke to no one else. Travelers passing by on the road would sometimes hear shrieks coming from both man and monkey; it was the man stroking the monkey.",CO013CL10
14462,679,"What did those two creatures live on? One morning, someone saw the monkey leave the house only to return shortly afterward carrying a package in its mouth. The muleteer who witnessed this wanted to find out where the monkey went to fetch that package, which doubtless contained food for those two solitary beings.",CO013CL10
14463,680,"The following morning, he hid in the wood; the monkey arrived at the usual hour and went over to a tree trunk; higher up the trunk was a large branch, which the monkey threw to the ground. Then, putting his hands inside the trunk, he took out a package identical to the one seen on the previous day, and left.",CO013CL10
14464,681,"The muleteer made the sign of the cross, and was so frightened by what he had seen that he told no one.",CO013CL10
14465,682,This went on for three years.,CO013CL10
14466,683,"During this time, the man did not age at all. He looked exactly as he had on the first day, with his long reddish beard and mane of shoulder-length hair. Winter and summer, he wore a big, heavy jacket, boots, but no hat.",CO013CL10
14467,684,"It was impossible for travelers or neighbors to penetrate that solitary house, but it need not be so for us, dear lady and dear friend.",CO013CL10
14468,685,"The house is divided into three rooms, a dining room, a parlor—for visitors—and a bedroom. The bedroom is occupied by the two inhabitants, Daniel and Caligula.",CO013CL10
14469,686,"The dining room and the parlor are the same size, the bedroom only half that size. The furniture in the parlor comprises two grubby benches positioned against the wall, and a low table in the middle. The floor is made of wood. On the walls hang two portraits: one of a young woman, the other of an old man.",CO013CL10
14470,687,"The young woman has a delightful, angelic face. The old man’s face inspires respect and admiration. On the other two walls hang, on one side, a knife with an ivory handle, and on the other, a dead hand, withered and yellow.",CO013CL10
14471,688,The dining room contains only a table and two benches.,CO013CL10
14472,689,"The furniture in the bedroom consists of a pallet bed, where Daniel sleeps, while Caligula lies on the floor, alongside his master.",CO013CL10
14473,690,So much for the furniture.,CO013CL10
14474,691,"Seen from outside, one might think that a man could not even stand upright in those rooms, but because, as I said earlier, the lower half was below ground level, it was in fact, quite large enough.",CO013CL10
14475,692,What kind of life would monkey and man have led during those three years? Who can say?,CO013CL10
14476,693,"When Caligula brings the package in the morning, Daniel divides the food into two portions, one for lunch and the other for supper. Then man and monkey sit down facing each other in the dining room and eat those two meals in brotherly companionship.",CO013CL10
14477,694,"As I mentioned, when it’s a full moon, they sally forth each night until the moon begins to wane. They leave at around ten o’clock and return at around two in the morning. When they enter the house, Daniel takes the dead man’s hand off the wall and slaps himself twice. Having done this, he retires to bed, and Caligula goes with him.",CO013CL10
14478,695,"One night, in the month of June, at the time of the full moon, Daniel prepared to go out. With one leap, Caligula landed out in the road. Daniel closed the door and the two of them set off.",CO013CL10
14479,696,"The moon, entirely full, shed its pale, melancholy light on the vast woods covering the nearby hills, lighting up the vast area of grassland surrounding the house.",CO013CL10
14480,697,"All one could hear in the distance was the murmur of a waterfall, and, closer by, the hooting of some owls and the chirping of an endless number of crickets scattered over the plain.",CO013CL10
14481,698,"Daniel was walking slowly along, a stick under one arm, accompanied by the monkey, which kept leaping up onto his shoulders, then back onto the ground.",CO013CL10
14482,699,"Even without the gloomy nature of that solitary place inhabited only by the man and the monkey, anyone meeting the pair at that hour risked dying of fright. Daniel was extremely tall and thin and cut an equally gloomy figure. His abundant hair and beard made his head seem still larger than it was, and, bareheaded as he was, he looked positively satanic.",CO013CL10
14483,700,"On other days, Caligula was just an ordinary monkey, but on those nocturnal walks, he took on the same mysterious, gloomy air as Daniel.",CO013CL10
14484,701,"The two had been out for an hour already, and the house was some way off. What could be more natural than for the police to take the opportunity to enter the house and uncover its mystery? The police, however, despite having every means at their disposal, could not bring themselves to investigate what the local people believed to be some diabolical mystery.",CO013CL10
14485,702,"The police are human, too, and know all there is to know about the human race. As I was saying, an hour had passed since man and monkey had left the house. Then they began to climb a small hill—",CO013CL10
14486,703,Tito was interrupted by a yawn from Diogo.,CO013CL10
14487,704,“Are you ready for bed?” asked Tito.,CO013CL10
14488,705,“That is precisely where I intend to go.”,CO013CL10
14489,706,“But what about the story?”,CO013CL10
14490,707,"“Well, it is, of course, a most amusing story. Up until now, we’ve seen two characters, a man and a monkey, no, what am I saying, we’ve seen two other characters, a monkey and a man. Fascinating stuff. And just to vary things, I suppose the man will one day go out and leave the monkey on its own.”",CO013CL10
14491,708,"Diogo uttered these words with almost comic rage, then picked up his hat and left.",CO013CL10
14492,709,Tito burst out laughing.,CO013CL10
14493,710,“Aren’t you going to finish the story?” asked Emília.,CO013CL10
14494,711,"“Finish it, senhora? I was already struggling to know how to continue . . . It was simply a way of helping you out. The man’s obviously a frightful bore.”",CO013CL10
14495,712,"“No, no, you’re wrong.”",CO013CL10
14496,713,“Really?”,CO013CL10
14497,714,"“He amuses me, although, of course, I find your conversation infinitely more pleasing.”",CO013CL10
14498,715,“Now you’ve just told a falsehood.”,CO013CL10
14499,716,“What?”,CO013CL10
14500,717,"“You said you found my conversation pleasing, and that’s an out-and-out lie.”",CO013CL10
14501,718,“Now you’re fishing for compliments.”,CO013CL10
14502,719,"“No, I’m just being honest. I really don’t know how you put up with me: I’m rude, tedious, sarcastic, a complete skeptic, in short, a most undesirable conversationalist. You’re obviously a very kind person to say such benevolent, friendly things—”",CO013CL10
14503,720,“That’s enough of your sarcasm.”,CO013CL10
14504,721,"“Sarcasm, senhora?”",CO013CL10
14505,722,"“Yesterday, my aunt and I took tea alone. Alone!”",CO013CL10
14506,723,“Ah!”,CO013CL10
14507,724,“I was counting on you to come and spend a boring hour or so with us.”,CO013CL10
14508,725,“Boring? Let me explain what happened. It was all Ernesto’s fault.”,CO013CL10
14509,726,“Was it?”,CO013CL10
14510,727,"“It’s true. He met me in the house of some mutual friends, there were four of us in all, the talk turned to ombre, and we ended up having a game or two. We were there all night. And, as always happens, I won!”",CO013CL10
14511,728,"“Did you, now?”",CO013CL10
14512,729,"“And they were no mere novices, either, but real masters of the game, especially one of them. Up until eleven o’clock it seemed that fortune was refusing to smile on me, but after that, things turned in my favor, and I began to dazzle. And, believe me, they were dazzled. I have a certificate to prove it, but, what’s this, are you crying?”",CO013CL10
14513,730,"Emília did indeed have a handkerchief pressed to her eyes. Was she crying? It’s true that when she removed the handkerchief, her eyes were moist. She turned away from the light and said:",CO013CL10
14514,731,“Of course not . . . do go on.”,CO013CL10
14515,732,"“There’s nothing more to tell,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
14516,733,“I hope you enjoyed yourself . . .”,CO013CL10
14517,734,“Somewhat . . .”,CO013CL10
14518,735,“But letters are meant to be answered. Why did you not respond to mine?” said Emília.,CO013CL10
14519,736,“Your what?”,CO013CL10
14520,737,“The letter I wrote asking you to come and take tea with us.”,CO013CL10
14521,738,“I don’t remember.”,CO013CL10
14522,739,“You don’t remember?”,CO013CL10
14523,740,"“Or if I did receive that letter, it was at a moment when I didn’t have time to read it, and then I must have forgotten and left it somewhere . . .”",CO013CL10
14524,741,"“That’s quite possible, but it’s the last time . . .”",CO013CL10
14525,742,“Do you mean you’re never going to invite me to tea again?”,CO013CL10
14526,743,"“Yes, that’s precisely what I mean. You risk missing out on something better.”",CO013CL10
14527,744,“Not at all. You’re a charming hostess and I always enjoy coming to your house. I mean it. So you took tea alone? What about Diogo?”,CO013CL10
14528,745,“I got rid of him. Do you imagine he would make for amusing company?”,CO013CL10
14529,746,"“Apparently. He’s a polite enough fellow, somewhat temperamental, it’s true, but since that is a common fault, I hardly feel I can criticize him for that.”",CO013CL10
14530,747,“Diogo has been avenged.”,CO013CL10
14531,748,"“For what, senhora?”",CO013CL10
14532,749,Emília looked hard at Tito and said:,CO013CL10
14533,750,"“Oh, nothing.”",CO013CL10
14534,751,"Then, standing up, she went over to the piano.",CO013CL10
14535,752,"“I’m going to play something,” she said. “Do you mind?”",CO013CL10
14536,753,“Not at all.”,CO013CL10
14537,754,"Emília began to play, but the music was so sad that it made Tito feel rather melancholy too. After a time, he interrupted her with these words:",CO013CL10
14538,755,“That’s dreadfully sad music!”,CO013CL10
14539,756,"“I’m translating my own soul,” said the widow.",CO013CL10

14541,758,“What do you care about my sadnesses?”,CO013CL10
14542,759,"“No, you’re right, I don’t care about them in the least. But it’s nothing I’ve done, is it?”",CO013CL10
14543,760,Emília got up and went over to him.,CO013CL10
14544,761,“Do you think I can forgive you for snubbing me?”,CO013CL10
14545,762,"“What do you mean, ‘snubbing’ you?”",CO013CL10
14546,763,“By not accepting my invitation.”,CO013CL10
14547,764,“But I’ve already explained—”,CO013CL10
14548,765,"“Enough! I’m sorry, too, that Adelaide’s husband was involved in that game.”",CO013CL10
14549,766,"“He left at ten o’clock, and someone else took his place, not a bad player, as it happens.”",CO013CL10
14550,767,“Poor Adelaide!”,CO013CL10

14552,769,"“He should never have gone in the first place. He should belong entirely to his wife. I know I’m speaking to an unbeliever, but you cannot imagine the sheer bliss of a dutiful domestic life. Two creatures living solely for each other as one person; thinking, breathing, dreaming the same things; finding their horizon in the other’s eyes, with no greater ambition, not wanting anything more. Do you know what that is?”",CO013CL10
14553,770,“I do . . . it’s marriage viewed from the outside.”,CO013CL10

14585,802,"Diogo was about to make his final bow, when the widow addressed him:",CO013CL10
14586,803,"“Listen, Senhor Diogo. You heard correctly, but you interpreted what you heard quite wrongly. Because what you think you know—”",CO013CL10
14587,804,"“I know, you’re going to tell me that it’s all part of a trick you’re playing on that young man . . .”",CO013CL10
14588,805,“How do you know?”,CO013CL10
14589,806,“Dona Adelaide told me.”,CO013CL10
14590,807,“And it’s true.”,CO013CL10
14591,808,“I don’t believe you.”,CO013CL10
14592,809,“Why not?”,CO013CL10
14593,810,“Because there were tears in your voice. Your words pierced my heart. If you knew how I suffered!”,CO013CL10
14594,811,"The lovely widow could not help but smile at the comically tragic look on Diogo’s face. Then, when he seemed plunged in somber thoughts, she said:",CO013CL10
14595,812,"“You’re quite wrong; in fact, I intend to return to Rio.”",CO013CL10
14596,813,“Is that true?”,CO013CL10
14597,814,“Do you really think a man like him could arouse any serious feelings? Never!”,CO013CL10
14598,815,"These words were spoken in the tone she usually used to persuade her eternal inamorato. That and another smile were enough to reassure Diogo. A few minutes later, he was positively beaming.",CO013CL10
14599,816,"“And to convince you once and for all, I’m going to write a note to Tito . . .”",CO013CL10
14600,817,"“I’ll deliver it myself,” said Diogo, quite wild with contentment.",CO013CL10
14601,818,“Why not!”,CO013CL10
14602,819,"“Until tomorrow, then. Sweet dreams, and forgive me if I’ve behaved badly. Goodbye.”",CO013CL10

14605,822,"The following day, at noon, Diogo went to see Tito and, after talking about various other matters, he took from his pocket a letter, which he pretended to have forgotten about until then, and to which he appeared to give no great importance.",CO013CL10
14606,823,“What a bombshell!” he said to himself as Tito tore open the envelope.,CO013CL10
14607,824,Here is what the letter said:,CO013CL10
14608,825,"I gave you my heart, but you did not want it and even scorned it. You so trampled it underfoot that it has stopped beating. It’s dead. I’m not blaming you, for one should not speak of light to the blind. It was entirely my fault. I thought I could bring you happiness and receive equal happiness in return. I was wrong.",CO013CL10
14609,826,"You have the honor of withdrawing from the field wearing the laurels of victory. I remain here wounded and defeated. Never mind! Feel free to mock me, I won’t deny you that right.",CO013CL10
14610,827,"Meanwhile, I must tell you that I recognized you; I never said anything, but I recognized you at once. That first day when I saw you at Adelaide’s house, I realized you were the same man who once came to me and threw himself at my feet . . . You were mocking me then, as you did today. I should have known that. I have paid dearly for my mistake. Goodbye, goodbye forever.",CO013CL10
14611,828,"Tito glanced repeatedly at Diogo while he was reading this letter. Why had he agreed to deliver the note? Was it genuine or a forgery? As well as being unsigned, there had been a clear attempt to disguise the writing. Could it be another of the old man’s ploys to get rid of him? If so, he must have known what had happened on the previous evening.",CO013CL10
14612,829,"Tito reread the letter many times, and when he parted from Diogo, he said that his response would soon follow.",CO013CL10
14613,830,"Diogo left, rubbing his hands with glee.",CO013CL10
14614,831,"The letter read by you, the readers, along with our hero was not the same letter Emília had read to Diogo. In that draft note, she had declared simply that she was leaving for Rio, adding that among the memories she would carry away with her from Petrópolis would be that of Tito, and the impression he had made on her. However, with supremely feminine dexterity, that draft note was not, as you will have seen, the one Emília sent to Tito.",CO013CL10
14615,832,Tito responded to Emília’s letter in the following terms:,CO013CL10
14616,833,"Madam,",CO013CL10
14617,834,"I have read and reread your letter, and I will not conceal from you the sadness it awoke in me. Is that really the true state of your heart? Are you really so in love with me?",CO013CL10
14618,835,"You say I trampled on your heart. The thought saddens me, although I cannot confirm that it’s true. I cannot remember ever having inflicted such damage, but then you say that I did, and I must believe you.",CO013CL10
14619,836,"Reading this letter, you will be thinking that I am the most impudent gentleman ever to have trodden Brazil’s fair soil. You would be mistaken. This is not impudence on my part, but frankness. I regret that it should have come to this, but I can only tell you the truth.",CO013CL10
14620,837,"I must confess that I cannot even be sure that the letter I am responding to was from you. Your writing, of which I saw an example in Dona Adelaide’s scrapbook, is nothing like the writing in the letter, which is clearly in a disguised hand; it could be from anyone. Besides, there is no signature.",CO013CL10
14621,838,I mention this because an initial doubt was sown in me by the person chosen to deliver the letter. Could you really find no one better for the task than Diogo? I must say that was truly the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.,CO013CL10
14622,839,"But I shouldn’t laugh. You opened your heart to me in a way that inspires compassion not laughter, and that compassion is in no way disrespectful to you, because it lacks all irony. It is pure and sincere. I am sorry I cannot give you the happiness you ask me for, but that is how it is.",CO013CL10
14623,840,"I should stop now, and yet I find it hard to raise my pen from the paper. Few men will ever find themselves in the position of being the pursued, not the pursuer. But I must and will finish here, sending you my deepest regrets and praying to God that you find a heart less cold than mine.",CO013CL10
14624,841,"My writing is disguised as was yours, and, as in your letter, I leave the signature blank.",CO013CL10
14625,842,"This letter was delivered to the widow that same afternoon. Azevedo and Adelaide went to visit her that evening, but could not dissuade her from leaving for Rio.",CO013CL10
14626,843,"Emília was even rather cold toward Adelaide, who, unable to understand the reason for such coolness, left feeling somewhat sad.",CO013CL10
14627,844,"The following day, Emília and her aunt packed their bags and left for Rio.",CO013CL10
14628,845,"Diogo stayed on in Petrópolis, taking his time over packing his own cases, because, he said, he did not want to be seen departing at the same time as those two good ladies and for unseemly thoughts about him and Emília to circulate.",CO013CL10
14629,846,"Adelaide was completely bemused by all of this, for, as I said, she felt sure that both Emília’s coldness and her insistence on leaving Petrópolis concealed some incomprehensible secret.",CO013CL10
14630,847,"Was she hoping by her departure to draw Tito after her? If so, she was quite mistaken, because Tito did exactly as he did every day, waking late and eating his breakfast in the best of spirits.",CO013CL10
14631,848,"“I suppose you know,” Adelaide said to him, “that our friend Emília will have left for Rio by now?”",CO013CL10

14633,850,"“Why is that, do you think?”",CO013CL10
14634,851,"“Ah, that I do not know. They are the lofty secrets of a woman’s mind! Why does the breeze blow from this direction one day and not from over there? I really don’t care, frankly.”",CO013CL10
14635,852,"When Tito had finished his breakfast, he did, as usual, retire to his room to read for a couple of hours.",CO013CL10
14636,853,"Adelaide was just about to issue some instructions to the servants when she was astonished to see Emília enter the house, accompanied by her maid.",CO013CL10
14637,854,"“So you didn’t go, after all?” said Adelaide, rushing over to embrace her.",CO013CL10
14638,855,“As you see.”,CO013CL10
14639,856,"At a gesture from Emília, the servant left the room.",CO013CL10
14640,857,"“What happened?” Adelaide asked, seeing her friend’s strangely agitated state.",CO013CL10
14641,858,"“What happened?” Emília repeated. “The unforeseeable. You’re like a sister to me, Adelaide, so I can speak frankly. No one can hear us, can they?”",CO013CL10
14642,859,"“No, Ernesto is out and Tito is up in his room. But whatever’s wrong?”",CO013CL10
14643,860,"“Adelaide,” said Emília, her eyes brimming with tears, “I love him!”",CO013CL10
14644,861,“What?”,CO013CL10
14645,862,"“As I said, I am utterly, deeply, madly in love with him. I have tried my best to suppress my feelings, but I can’t; and when, out of blind prejudice, I tried to hide my love from him, I couldn’t, the words just spilled forth . . .”",CO013CL10
14646,863,“But how did it happen?”,CO013CL10
14647,864,"“It’s as if it were a punishment; I got well and truly burned on the fire I myself started. These feelings didn’t just begin today. Something began stirring within me when I saw how steadfastly scornful he remained; at first I felt rather vexed, then I was filled with a desire to triumph, then by an ambition to give way on everything, on condition that I won everything too. In short, I lost all self-control. I was the one madly in love with him and this became abundantly clear in my words, my gestures, everything. And the more indifferent he became, the more my love for him increased.”",CO013CL10
14648,865,“Are you serious?”,CO013CL10
14649,866,“You have only to look at me.”,CO013CL10
14650,867,“Who would have thought it?”,CO013CL10
14651,868,"“It seems impossible to me, too, but it’s true.”",CO013CL10
14652,869,“And what about him?”,CO013CL10
14653,870,"“Oh, he just muttered something noncommittal and left.”",CO013CL10
14654,871,"“Will he hold out, do you think?”",CO013CL10
14655,872,“I don’t know.”,CO013CL10
14656,873,"“If I’d had even a suspicion this would happen, I would never have suggested that ill-fated plan of ours.”",CO013CL10
14657,874,"“No, you don’t understand. Do you think I regret feeling as I do? No! I feel happy, I feel proud. It’s one of those loves that bursts forth and fills one’s soul with satisfaction. I should bless you.”",CO013CL10
14658,875,"“So it’s true love, then. Will he never be converted?”",CO013CL10
14659,876,"“I don’t know, but regardless of whether he will or not, I’m not asking for his conversion,",CO013CL10
14660,877,just for a little less indifference and a little more understanding.”,CO013CL10
14661,878,"“So what are you going to do?” asked Adelaide, feeling her eyes filling with tears too.",CO013CL10
14662,879,There was a moment’s silence.,CO013CL10
14663,880,"“What you don’t know,” Emília went on, “is that he is not a complete stranger to me. I met him before I married for the first time. He was the man who asked for my hand in marriage before Rafael . . .”",CO013CL10
14664,881,“Ah!”,CO013CL10
14665,882,“Did you know about that?”,CO013CL10
14666,883,"“He did tell us that story, but never mentioned the lady in question. So that was you.”",CO013CL10
14667,884,"“It was. We both recognized each other, but said nothing.”",CO013CL10
14668,885,“Why?”,CO013CL10
14669,886,"The answer to this question was provided by Tito, who suddenly came in through the inner door. He had happened to be looking out of the window when Emília arrived and had crept downstairs in order to eavesdrop on her conversation with Adelaide. His surprise at her unexpected return must excuse such indiscretion.",CO013CL10
14670,887,"“Why, you ask?” he said. “I will tell you.”",CO013CL10
14671,888,"“But first of all,” said Adelaide, “are you aware that such complete indifference on your part could prove fatal to someone who is not so indifferent to you?”",CO013CL10
14672,889,"“You are referring to your friend here, are you?” asked Tito. “Well, I can resolve everything with a simple question.”",CO013CL10
14673,890,"And, turning to Emília, he held out his hand to her and said:",CO013CL10
14674,891,“Will you accept my hand in marriage?”,CO013CL10
14675,892,"Emília gave a yelp of utter joy, but then some remnant of pride, perhaps, or some other feeling, converted that joy into a single word, which she uttered with her voice breaking:",CO013CL10
14676,893,“Yes!” she said.,CO013CL10
14677,894,"Tito lovingly kissed her hand, then added:",CO013CL10
14678,895,"“But I should temper my generosity; I should say, rather, that I accept your hand. Should I or should I not? I’m a touch eccentric and always enjoy turning everything on its head.”",CO013CL10
14679,896,“Of course; I’m happy either way. And yet I’m filled with a great sense of remorse. Am I giving you as complete a happiness as the happiness I receive from you?”,CO013CL10
14680,897,"“Remorse? Yes, you should feel remorse, but for quite another reason. You feel horribly humiliated at the moment, and I did make you suffer, didn’t I? However, when you hear what I have to say, you will agree, I’m sure, that I, too, suffered, and far more bitterly.”",CO013CL10
14681,898,"“This sounds like something out of a novel,” Adelaide said to Tito.",CO013CL10
14682,899,"“No, it’s pure reality,” answered Tito, “prosaic reality. One day, some years ago now, I was fortunate enough to see a young woman, with whom I fell in love. That love was as irresistible as it was sudden. And it was more ardent then than it is now, because, at the time, I was innocent of the ways of the world. I resolved to declare my love and ask for her hand in marriage. I received this note in reply . . .”",CO013CL10
14683,900,"“I know,” said Emília. “I was that young woman, and I feel utterly humbled. Forgive me!”",CO013CL10
14684,901,“My love forgives you. I never stopped loving you. I was certain that I would find you again one day and I have done my best to make you love me.”,CO013CL10
14685,902,"“No, really, if you wrote this down, people would say it was a novel,” said Adelaide gaily.",CO013CL10
14686,903,"“Life is a novel,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
14687,904,"Half an hour later, Azevedo arrived. Amazed to find Emília there when he had assumed she would be on the train, and even more amazed by the cordial way in which Tito and Emília were chatting away to each other, he asked how all this had happened.",CO013CL10
14688,905,"“It’s quite simple,” answered Adelaide. “Emília came back because she’s going to marry Tito.”",CO013CL10
14689,906,"This reply failed to satisfy Azevedo, and he demanded a further explanation.",CO013CL10
14690,907,"“I see,” he said at last. “Having failed to get anywhere by following the straight line, Tito decided to see what could be achieved by following the curved line, which sometimes proves to be the shortest route.”",CO013CL10
14691,908,"“As it has here,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
14692,909,"Emília dined at their house. That evening, Diogo came to say goodbye, because he had to leave for Rio the next day. Imagine his surprise when he saw Emília there!",CO013CL10
14693,910,“You’ve come back!”,CO013CL10
14694,911,"“Yes,” said Emília, laughing.",CO013CL10
14695,912,"“Well, I was about to leave, too, but now I won’t. Ah, yes, and I’ve just received a letter from Europe, brought to me by the captain of the Macedonia. The bear has arrived!”",CO013CL10
14696,913,"“Good, it will be company for you,” said Tito.",CO013CL10
14697,914,"Diogo pulled a face; then, when he asked what lay behind Emília’s sudden return, she explained that she was going to marry Tito.",CO013CL10
14698,915,Diogo did not believe her.,CO013CL10
14699,916,"“This is another trick, isn’t it?” he said with a wink.",CO013CL10
14700,917,"And he not only refused to believe it then, he would not believe it later, either, despite all the evidence. A few days after this, they all left for Rio.",CO013CL10
14701,918,"Diogo remained unconvinced, but when he arrived at Emília’s house one day and saw that the wedding was about to take place, the poor man could no longer deny the facts. This was a huge blow to him, but he nevertheless summoned up the courage to attend the ceremony, at which Azevedo and Adelaide were witnesses.",CO013CL10

14706,3,"To exchange day for night, said Luiz Soares, is to restore the empire of nature by correcting the work of society. The heat of the sun is telling men to go rest and sleep, while the relative coolness of the night is the true season in which one must live. Free in all my actions, I don’t want to subject myself to the absurd law that society imposes on me: I’ll keep watch overnight, I’ll sleep during the day.",CO028CL11
14707,4,"Contrary to several ministries, Soares fulfilled this program with a scruple worthy of a great conscience. Dawn for him was twilight, twilight was dawn. He slept twelve consecutive hours during the day, that is, from six in the morning to six in the afternoon. He had lunch at seven and dined at two in the morning. No supper.",CO028CL11
14708,5,"His supper was confined to a cup of chocolate which the servant gave him at five o’clock in the morning as he entered the house. Soares swallowed the chocolate, smoked two cigars, made some puns with the servant, read a page of some novel, and lay down.",CO028CL11
14709,6,"He didn’t read newspapers. He thought that a newspaper was the most useless thing in the world, after the Chamber of Deputies, the works of poets, and church Masses. This doesn’t mean that Soares was an atheist in religion, politics, and poetry. No. Soares was just indifferent. He looked at all the great things with the same countenance as he looked at an ugly woman. It could be a huge perversion; until then it was just a huge uselessness.",CO028CL11
14710,7,"Thanks to a good fortune left by his father, Soares could enjoy the life he led, avoiding all kinds of work and surrendering only to the instincts of his nature and the whims of his heart. Heart is perhaps too much. It was doubtful that Soares had one. He said it himself. When some lady asked him to love her, Soares would answer:",CO028CL11
14711,8,"“My dear young woman, I was born with the great advantage of having nothing inside my chest or inside my head. What they call judgment and feeling are true mysteries to me. I don’t understand them because I don’t feel them.”",CO028CL11
14712,9,"He was, therefore, poor when he least expected it. One morning, that is, at the time of the Hail Mary, Soares’s eyes saw the fateful words of the Babylonian feasting written down. It was a letter that the servant had given him saying that Soares’s banker had dropped it off at midnight. The servant spoke as his master lived: at noon he called midnight.",CO028CL11
14713,10,"“I already told you,” replied Soares, “that I only receive letters from my friends, or…”",CO028CL11
14714,11,"“From some young woman, I know. That’s why I haven’t given you the letters that the banker has been bringing since a month ago. Today, however, the man said that it was indispensable that I gave you this one.”",CO028CL11
14715,12,Soares sat down on the bed and asked the servant half-cheerful and half-angry:,CO028CL11
14716,13,“So you’re his servant or mine?”,CO028CL11
14717,14,"“My master, the banker said it is a great danger.”",CO028CL11
14718,15,“What a danger?”,CO028CL11
14719,16,“I don’t know.”,CO028CL11
14720,17,“Let me see the letter.”,CO028CL11
14721,18,The servant handed him the letter.,CO028CL11
14722,19,Soares opened it and read it twice. The letter said that the young man had no more than six contos de réis. For Soares six contos de réis was less than six cents.,CO028CL11
14723,20,"For the first time in his life, Soares felt a great commotion. The idea of not having money had never come to mind; he didn’t imagine that he would ever find himself in the position of any other man who needed to work.",CO028CL11
14724,21,He ate lunch unwillingly and left. He went to Alcazar. Friends thought he was sad; they asked him if it was a love hurt. Soares replied that he was sick. The locals thought it was good taste to be sad as well. The consternation was general.,CO028CL11
14725,22,"One of his friends, José Pires, proposed a trip to Botafogo to distract Soares’s melancholy. The young man accepted. But the ride to Botafogo was so common that it couldn’t distract him. They remembered to go to Corcovado, an idea that was accepted and executed immediately.",CO028CL11
14726,23,"But what is there that can distract a young man in Soares’s conditions? The trip to the Corcovado only produced a great fatigue, useful for him, because, on his return, the young man slept soundly.",CO028CL11
14727,24,"When he woke he sent word to Pires to come to speak to him immediately. An hour later, a car stopped at the door: it was Pires who arrived, but accompanied by a dark-haired young woman who answered to the name of Victoria. The two entered Soares’s room with the frankness and din natural among family members.",CO028CL11
14728,25,“Aren’t you sick?” Victoria asked the owner of the house.,CO028CL11
14729,26,"“No,” said he; “but why did you come?”",CO028CL11
14730,27,“That’s good!” said José Pires; “She came because she’s my inseparable cup of tea… Did you want to talk to me privately?”,CO028CL11
14731,28,“I wanted to.”,CO028CL11
14732,29,"“Well, let’s talk in any corner; Victoria stays in the room looking at the albums.”",CO028CL11
14733,30,"“No,” interrupted the young woman; “In that case, I’m leaving. It’s better; I only impose a condition: it’s that both of you will go to the house later; we have a banquet.”",CO028CL11
14734,31,“Thanks!” said Pires.,CO028CL11
14735,32,Victoria left; the two young men were alone.,CO028CL11
14736,33,"Pires was the snoopy and frivolous type. When he smelled something new, he prepared himself to learn everything. Soares’s trust flattered him, and he guessed that the young man was going to tell him something important. For this, he took a liking to the situation. He sat comfortably in a chair; put the knob of the cane to his mouth and began the attack with these words:",CO028CL11
14737,34,“We are alone; what do you want from me?”,CO028CL11
14738,35,"Soares confided everything to him; read the letter from the banker; showed his misery in all its nakedness. He told him that in that situation he could see no possible solution, and he naively confessed that the idea of suicide had fed him for long hours.",CO028CL11
14739,36,“Suicide!” exclaimed Pires; “You are crazy.”,CO028CL11
14740,37,"“Crazy!” Soares replied; “however, I see no other way out in this alley. Moreover, it is only half suicide, because poverty is already half-dead.”",CO028CL11
14741,38,"“I agree that poverty is not a pleasant thing, and I think…”",CO028CL11
14742,39,"Pires broke off; a sudden thought crossed his mind: the idea that Soares would end the conference by asking for money. Pires had a precept in his life: not to lend money to his friends. No blood is lent, he would say.",CO028CL11
14743,40,"Soares didn’t notice his friend’s broken sentence, and said:",CO028CL11
14744,41,“Living as a poor man after being rich… it’s impossible.”,CO028CL11
14745,42,"“In which case what do you want from me?” asked Pires, who thought it was good to attack the bull head-on.",CO028CL11
14746,43,“Some advice.”,CO028CL11
14747,44,"“Useless advice, since you already have a fixed idea.”",CO028CL11
14748,45,"“Perhaps. However I confess that one doesn’t leave life easily, and, bad or good, it’s always difficult to die. On the other hand, bearing my misery before the people who have seen me rich is a humiliation that I don’t accept. What would you do in my place?”",CO028CL11
14749,46,"“Man,” answered Pires, “there are many means…”",CO028CL11
14750,47,“Give me one.”,CO028CL11
14751,48,“First possibility. You go to New York and look for a fortune.”,CO028CL11
14752,49,"“It doesn’t suit me; in this case, I stay in Rio de Janeiro.”",CO028CL11
14753,50,“Second possibility. Get yourself a rich marriage.”,CO028CL11
14754,51,“That’s good to say. Where is this marriage?”,CO028CL11
14755,52,“Look for it. Don’t you have a cousin who likes you?”,CO028CL11
14756,53,"“I don’t think she likes me anymore; and besides, she’s not rich; she has only thirty contos; a year’s expenses.”",CO028CL11
14757,54,“It’s a good principle of life.”,CO028CL11
14758,55,“No way; other possibility.”,CO028CL11
14759,56,"“Third possibility, and the best. Go to your uncle’s house, earn his esteem, say that you’re sorry for the past life, get a job; anyway, see if you become his universal heir.”",CO028CL11
14760,57,Soares didn’t answer; the idea seemed good to him.,CO028CL11
14761,58,"“I bet you like the third possibility?” asked Pires, laughing.",CO028CL11
14762,59,“It’s not bad. I accept; and I know it’s difficult and time-consuming; but I don’t have many to choose from.”,CO028CL11
14763,60,"“Good,” said Pires, rising to his feet. “Now what you want is some reason. It’ll cost you the sacrifice, but remember that it’s the only means of having a fortune in a short time. Your uncle is a man prone to illness; any day now he kicks the bucket. Enjoy the time. And now we go to Victoria’s supper.",CO028CL11
14764,61,"“I will not,” said Soares; “I want to get used to living a new life.”",CO028CL11
14765,62,“Well; goodbye.”,CO028CL11
14766,63,“Look! I entrusted this to you alone; keep it a secret.”,CO028CL11
14767,64,"“I am a tomb,” answered Pires, going down the stairs.",CO028CL11
14768,65,But the next day the young men and women knew that Soares was going to become an anchorite… for not having any money. Soares himself recognized this on the faces of his friends. Everyone seemed to tell him: It’s too bad! What a shame we’re going to lose!,CO028CL11
14769,66,Pires never visited him again.,CO028CL11
14770,67,Chapter II,CO028CL11
14771,68,"Soares’s uncle was called Major Luiz da Cunha Villela, and he was indeed an old and sick man. Yet it couldn’t be said that he’d die early. Major Villela observed a rigorous regimen that entertained his life. He was a well into his sixties. He was a cheerful old man at the same time.",CO028CL11
14772,69,"He liked to laugh, but he was ruthless with bad manners. Constitutional by necessity, at heart his soul was absolutist. He wept for the old society; and constantly criticized the new. Ultimately he was the last man to abandon his ponytail hairpiece.",CO028CL11
14773,70,"Major Villela lived in Catumbi, accompanied by his niece Adelaide, and another old female relative. His life was patriarchal. Caring little or nothing about what was going on outside, the Major would take care of his house, where few friends and some families in the neighborhood would visit him and spend the nights with him. The Major always kept the same joy, even on occasions when rheumatism prostrated him. Rheumatics will hardly believe it; but I can say that it was true.",CO028CL11
14774,71,"It was one day in the morning, fortunately a day when the Major felt no pain and laughed and played with the two female kinsfolk, that Soares appeared in Catumbi at his uncle’s door.",CO028CL11
14775,72,"When the Major received the card with his nephew’s name, he assumed it was some mockery. He could count on everyone at home, except the nephew. He hadn’t seen him in two years, and between the last and the penultimate time it had been around a year and a half. But the errand boy told him so seriously that nhonhô Luiz was in the waiting room that the old man finally believed him.",CO028CL11
14776,73,"“What do you think, Adelaide?”",CO028CL11
14777,74,The young woman didn’t answer.,CO028CL11
14778,75,The old man went into the living room.,CO028CL11
14779,76,"Soares had thought of how to approach his uncle. Kneeling was too dramatic; falling into his arms demanded a certain inner impulse which he didn’t have; besides that, Soares was vexed of having or pretending an emotional distress. He remembered to start conversation outside the end that led him there, and to eventually confess that he wanted to change the subject.",CO028CL11
14780,77,But this means had the inconvenience of having to precede the repentance with a sermon which the young man would dispense. He hadn’t yet resolved to accept one of the many ways that came to his mind when the Major appeared at the door of the room.,CO028CL11
14781,78,"The Major stood at the door without a word and cast a stern, questioning glance over his nephew.",CO028CL11
14782,79,"Soares hesitated a moment; but since the situation could be prolonged without benefiting him, the young man followed a natural movement: he went to his uncle and extended his hand.",CO028CL11
14783,80,"“My uncle,” he said, “you don’t need to say anything else; your glance tells me everything. I was a sinner and I repent. Here I am.”",CO028CL11
14784,81,"The Major held out his hand, which the young man kissed with the respect of which he was susceptible.",CO028CL11
14785,82,Then he went to a chair and sat down; the young man remained standing,CO028CL11
14786,83,"“If your repentance is sincere, I’ll open my door and my heart. If you’re not honest you can go; I haven’t been to the opera house for a long time: I don’t like comedians.”",CO028CL11
14787,84,"Soares protested that he was sincere. He said he had been dissipated and crazy, but at the age of thirty it was right to get to his senses. He recognized now that his uncle had always been right. He supposed at the beginning that they were the simple antics of an old man, and nothing more; but wasn’t this the light-heartedness of a young man educated in vice?",CO028CL11
14788,85,"Luckily he corrected himself in time. What he now wanted was to get into a good life, and he began by accepting a public job that would force him to work and be serious. It was about winning a position.",CO028CL11
14789,86,"Hearing the speech that I summarized above, the Major tried to guess the depths of Soares’s thought. Was he sincere? The old man concluded that his nephew was speaking with his soul in his hands. Illusion came to the point of seeing a tear in his eyes, a tear that didn’t appear, not even feigned.",CO028CL11
14790,87,"When Soares finished, the Major held out his hand and pressed the one that the young man also extended to him.",CO028CL11
14791,88,"“I believe you, Luiz. I’m glad you regretted it in time. That which you lived was neither life nor death; life is more dignified and death quieter than the life you have wasted. You now come home as a prodigal son. You’ll have the best place at the table. This family is the same family.",CO028CL11
14792,89,"The Major continued in this tone; Soares listened, standing, to his uncle’s speech. He told himself that it was the sample of the penalty he was going to suffer, and a great reduction of his sins.",CO028CL11
14793,90,"The Major ended up taking the young man inside, where lunch was waiting for them.",CO028CL11
14794,91,"In the dining room were Adelaide and the old female relative. Mrs. Antônia de Moura Villela received Soares with great exclamations that sincerely shamed the young man. As for Adelaide, she only greeted him without looking at him; Soares returned the compliment.",CO028CL11
14795,92,"The Major noticed the coldness; but he seemed to know something, for he only laughed a jaundiced chuckle, something peculiar to him.",CO028CL11
14796,93,"They sat at the table, and lunch went about between the Major’s quips, Senhora Antônia’s recriminations, the young man’s explanations, and Adelaide’s silence. When lunch was over, the Major told his nephew to smoke, a huge concession which the young man accepted at some cost. Both ladies left; they both stayed at the table.",CO028CL11
14797,94,“Are you ready to work?”,CO028CL11
14798,95,"“I am, my uncle.”",CO028CL11
14799,96,“Well; I’ll see if I can get you a job. What job do you prefer?”,CO028CL11
14800,97,"“Whatever you want, my uncle, as long as I work.”",CO028CL11
14801,98,“Good. You’ll take a letter from me to one of the ministers tomorrow. God willing you can get the job without difficulty. I want to see you working hard and serious; I want to see you a man. Dissipations produce nothing except debt and displeasure… Do you have any debts?”,CO028CL11
14802,99,"“None,” answered Soares.",CO028CL11
14803,100,"Soares was lying. He had a tailor’s debt, relatively small; he wanted to pay it without his uncle knowing.",CO028CL11
14804,101,"The next day the Major wrote the promised letter, which the nephew took to the minister; and he was so fortunate that after a month he was employed in a well-ordered office.",CO028CL11
14805,102,"It is fair to do justice to the young man. The sacrifice he made to transform his life habits was enormous, and judging from his background no one had thought him capable of such thing. But the desire to perpetuate a life of dissipation can explain the change and the sacrifice. That, in Soares’s existence, was no more than a more or less extensive parenthesis. He longed to close it and continue the period as it had begun, that is, living with Aspasia and reveling with Alcibiades.",CO028CL11
14806,103,"The uncle didn’t suspect anything; but he feared that the young man might be tempted to flee again, or that he might be seduced by the remembrance of the old dissipations, or that he would be annoyed by the monotony and fatigue of work. In order to prevent the disaster, he remembered to inspire political ambition in him. The Major thought that politics would be a decisive remedy for this sick man, as if it wasn’t known that laurels of Lovelace8 and those of Turgor are often in the same head.",CO028CL11
14807,104,"Soares didn’t discourage the Major. He said it was natural to end his existence in politics, and even went so far as to say that he had sometimes dreamed of having a seat in Parliament.",CO028CL11
14808,105,"“I will see if I can arrange this for you,” replied the uncle. “What you need is to study the science of politics, the history of our parliament and of our government; and most of all you must continue to be what you are today: a serious young man.”",CO028CL11
14809,106,"If the Major said so, Soares, who since then got into the books and read the discussions of the Chambers, had better do it.",CO028CL11
14810,107,"Soares didn’t live with his uncle but spent all his spare time from work there, and returned home after tea, which was patriarchal, and quite different from the banquets of times past.",CO028CL11
14811,108,"I don’t claim that there was no common bond between Luiz Soares’s two phases of existence, and that the emigrant of the lands of Cnido wouldn’t occasionally make excursions to his homeland. In any case, these excursions were so secret that no one knew of them, perhaps not even the inhabitants of those lands, except for the few chosen to receive the expatriate.",CO028CL11
14812,109,"The case was singular, because in that country the naturalized foreign citizen is not recognized, unlike England, which doesn’t give the subjects of the queen the right to choose another country.",CO028CL11
14813,110,"Soares met Pires from time to time. The confidant of the convert manifested his old friendship by offering him a cigar from Havana and telling him of some good fortunes in the campaigns of love, in which he was supposed to be a general.",CO028CL11
14814,111,"It had been five months since Major Villela’s nephew had been employed, and yet the chiefs of the office hadn’t had a single complaint against him. Dedication was worthy of a better cause. Outwardly a monk was seen in Luiz Soares; scratching the surface, one would find the devil.",CO028CL11
14815,112,"Well, the devil saw a conquest from afar…",CO028CL11
14816,113,Chapter III,CO028CL11
14817,114,"Cousin Adelaide was twenty-four, and her beauty, in the full development of her youth, had the power to make people die of love. She was tall and well-proportioned; had a head shaped in the old type; the forehead was roomy and tall; the eyes were slanted and black; the nose slightly aquiline. Those who gazed upon her for some time felt that she had all the energies, that of passions and that of will.",CO028CL11
14818,115,"The reader might remember the cold greeting exchanged between Adelaide and her cousin; you might also remember that Soares told his friend Pires that he’d been loved by his cousin. These two things are connected. Adelaide’s coldness was the result of a memory that was painful to the young woman; Adelaide had loved her cousin, not with a simple love of cousins, which usually results from coexistence and not from sudden attraction. She had loved him with all the vigor and warmth of her soul; but even then the young man started his steps into other regions and was indifferent to the young woman’s affections. A friend who knew the secret asked him one day why he wouldn’t marry Adelaide, and the young man replied coldly:",CO028CL11
14819,116,"“Someone who has my fortune doesn’t marry; but if you get married, it’s always with those who have more. Adelaide’s assets are the fifth of mine; for her it is a great deal; for me it’s a bad deal.”",CO028CL11
14820,117,"The friend who had heard this answer didn’t fail to give proof of his affection to the young man and went to tell the young woman everything. The blow was tremendous, not so much for the certainty it gave her of not being loved, as for the circumstance of not even being entitled to esteem. Soares’s confession was a corpus delicti. The unofficial confidante perhaps hoped to reap the spoils of the defeat; but Adelaide, no sooner had she heard the accusation than she despised the informant.",CO028CL11
14821,118,The incident was nothing more than that.,CO028CL11
14822,119,"When Soares returned to his uncle’s house, the young woman found herself in a painful situation; she was obliged to get along with a man whom she couldn’t even appreciate. For his part, the young man was also shy, not because of the words he had said one day, but because of his uncle, who was unaware of anything. He wasn’t ignorant of it; the young man supposed so. The Major knew of Adelaide’s passion and he also learned of the repulsion in the young man’s heart.",CO028CL11
14823,120,"Perhaps he didn’t know the textual words repeated to the young woman by Soares’s friend; but if he didn’t know the text, he knew the spirit; he knew that for the sake of being loved, the young man had come to be annoyed by his cousin, and that she, seeing herself repelled, had come to be annoyed by the young man. The Major even assumed for some time that Soares’s absence was due to the young woman’s presence in the house.",CO028CL11
14824,121,"Adelaide was the daughter of one of the Major’s brothers, a very wealthy and equally eccentric man who had died ten years before and left the young woman in the care of his brother. Since Adelaide’s father had made many trips, it seems that he spent most of his fortune on them. When he died, Adelaide, his only daughter, had about thirty contos, which her uncle kept intact to be the dowry of the pupil.",CO028CL11
14825,122,"Soares did what he could in the singular situation he was in. He didn’t talk to his cousin, only exchanged the strictly necessary words with her not to catch the attention of her uncle. The young woman did the same.",CO028CL11
14826,123,"But who can have a hand on the heart? Luiz Soares’s cousin felt that little by little her old affection was reborn. He tried to fight it honestly; but one cannot impede the growth of a plant except by tearing out its roots. The roots still existed. In spite of her efforts, love gradually came to invade the place of hatred, and if until then the torment was great, now it was enormous. There had been a struggle between pride and love. The young woman suffered within herself, didn’t articulate a word.",CO028CL11
14827,124,"Luiz Soares noticed that when his fingers touched those of his cousin, she felt a great emotion: she blushed and became pale. The young man was a great navigator in the seas of love: he knew the calm and the storm. He convinced himself that his cousin loved him again. The discovery didn’t cheer him up; on the contrary, it caused him great irritation.",CO028CL11
14828,125,"He feared that his uncle, finding out the feeling of his niece, would propose the marriage to the young man, and wouldn’t refusing be to compromise the expected inheritance in the future? Inheritance without marriage was the young man’s ideal.",CO028CL11
14829,126,"“To give myself wings,” he thought, “tying my feet is like condemning me to prison. It’s the fate of the domestic parrot; I don’t aspire to have it.”",CO028CL11
14830,127,The young man’s predictions were realized. The Major discovered the cause of the young woman’s sadness and resolved to put an end to this situation by proposing the marriage to his nephew.,CO028CL11
14831,128,Soares couldn’t openly refuse without compromising the building of his fortune.,CO028CL11
14832,129,"“This marriage,” said his uncle, “complements my happiness. In one go I unite two people that I esteem, and I die in peace without taking any regrets to another world. I expect you’ll accept it.”",CO028CL11
14833,130,"“I accept, my uncle; but I observe that marriage is based on love, and I don’t love my cousin.”",CO028CL11
14834,131,“Well; you shall love her; first you get married…”,CO028CL11
14835,132,“I don’t wish to hold her up to disillusionment.”,CO028CL11
14836,133,"“What disillusionment!” said the Major, smiling. “I like to hear you speaking that poetic language, but marriage isn’t poetry. It’s true that it’s good that two people should already have some mutual esteem before marriage. That I think you do. For ardent fires, my dear nephew, are things that look good in verse, and even in prose; but in life, which is neither prose nor verse, marriage only requires certain conformity of genius, education, and esteem.",CO028CL11
14837,134,“My uncle knows I don’t refuse an order of yours.”,CO028CL11
14838,135,"“Order, no! I don’t command you; I propose. You say you don’t love your cousin; well then, try to, and after some time get married and that will give me pleasure. What I want is for it to be soon, because I’m not far from kicking the bucket.”",CO028CL11
14839,136,"The young man said yes. He put off the difficulty as he couldn’t solve it. The Major was pleased with the arrangement and comforted the niece with the promise that she could marry the cousin one day. It was the first time the old man had touched on such a subject, and Adelaide didn’t disguise her astonishment, an astonishment that deeply flattered the Major’s insight.",CO028CL11
14840,137,"“Ah! Do you think,” he said, “that I, because I’m old, have lost my heart’s eyes? I see everything, Adelaide; I see what you want to hide.”",CO028CL11
14841,138,"The young woman couldn’t hold back a few tears, and as the old man comforted her and gave her hope, she replied, shaking her head:",CO028CL11
14842,139,"“Hopes, none!”",CO028CL11
14843,140,“Leave it with me!” said the Major.,CO028CL11
14844,141,"Although her uncle’s dedication was all spontaneous and the daughter of the love he devoted to his niece, she understood that such an intervention might make her cousin suppose that she was begging for his heart’s affections.",CO028CL11
14845,142,"Here spoke the pride of the woman, who preferred suffering to humiliation. When she put these objections to her uncle, the Major smiled fondly and tried to calm the young woman’s susceptibility.",CO028CL11
14846,143,"A few days passed without further incident; the young man was in the joy of the delay his uncle had given him. Adelaide regained her cool, indifferent air. Soares understood the motive, and to that expression of pride he replied with a smile. Twice Adelaide noticed this expression of disdain on her cousin’s part. What else did she need to recognize that the young man felt the same indifference from previous time toward her? In addition, whenever the two were alone, Soares was the first to distance himself from her. He was the same man.",CO028CL11
14847,144,"“He doesn’t love me, he’ll never love me!” she would say to herself.",CO028CL11
14848,145,Chapter IV,CO028CL11
14849,146,One morning Major Villela received the following letter:,CO028CL11
14850,147,My brave Major.,CO028CL11
14851,148,"I arrived from Bahia today, and I’ll go there in the afternoon to see you and give you a hug. Make a supper. I believe that you won’t receive me like any individual. Don’t forget the vatapá.",CO028CL11
14852,149,"Your friend, Anselmo.",CO028CL11
14853,150,"“Bravo!” said the Major. “We have Anselmo here; cousin Antônia, have a good vatapá made.”",CO028CL11
14854,151,"The Anselmo who had arrived from Bahia was called Anselmo Barroso de Vasconcellos. He was a wealthy farmer, and an independence veteran. At the age of seventy-eight he was still vigorous and capable of great deeds. He had been an intimate friend of Adelaide’s father, who had introduced him to the Major, having become friends with him after the other had died. Anselmo accompanied his friend until his last moments and wept the loss as if he were his own brother. The tears cemented the friendship between him and the Major.",CO028CL11
14855,152,"In the afternoon Anselmo appeared playful and lively as if he had begun a new youth. He hugged them all; he kissed Adelaide, whom he congratulated for the development of her beauty.",CO028CL11
14856,153,"“Don’t laugh at me,” he said, “I was your father’s closest friend. Poor friend! He died in my arms.”",CO028CL11
14857,154,"Soares, who suffered from the monotony of the life he led at his uncle’s house, rejoiced with the presence of the old jester who was a real fireworks display. Anselmo didn’t seem to sympathize with the Major’s nephew. When the Major heard this, he said:",CO028CL11
14858,155,"“I’m sorry, because Soares is a serious young man.”",CO028CL11
14859,156,“I think he’s too serious. A young man who doesn’t laugh…”,CO028CL11
14860,157,I don’t know what incident interrupted the farmer’s sentence.,CO028CL11
14861,158,After dinner Anselmo said to the Major:,CO028CL11
14862,159,“What’s it tomorrow?”,CO028CL11
14863,160,“The fifteenth.”,CO028CL11
14864,161,“Of what month?”,CO028CL11
14865,162,“Good one! Of December.”,CO028CL11
14866,163,"“Well, tomorrow, the  of December, I must have a conference with you and your relatives. If the steamship was delayed one day on the way I would have played a good trick on me.”",CO028CL11
14867,164,"The next day the conference was called by Anselmo. The Major, Soares, Adelaide, and Dona Antônia, the only relatives of the deceased, were present.",CO028CL11
14868,165,"“Today has been ten years since the father of this girl died,” said Anselmo, pointing to Adelaide. “As you know, Dr. Bento Varella was my best friend, and I’m aware that I corresponded with his affection until the last moments. You know he was an eccentric genius; his whole life was a great originality. He thought of twenty projects, as grandiose, as impossible, without reaching the end of any; because his creative spirit so quickly composed one thing as he went on to plan another.”",CO028CL11
14869,166,"“That’s true,” interrupted the Major.",CO028CL11
14870,167,"“Bento died in my arms, and as a last proof of his friendship he entrusted me with the statement that I should open it only in the presence of his relatives ten years after his death. In case I died my heirs would take on this obligation; in the lack of them, the Major, Mrs. Dona Adelaide, ultimately anyone who was bound to him by blood. Anyway, if there was nobody in the mentioned class, a notary would be assigned. All this I had declared in testament, which I will amend. The paper I’m referring to, I have in my pocket.",CO028CL11
14871,168,There was a bustle of curiosity.,CO028CL11
14872,169,Anselmo took from his pocket a letter shut with black seal.,CO028CL11
14873,170,"“This is it,” he said. “It’s intact. I don’t know the text; but I can more or less know what’s inside by circumstances I’m going to refer to.”",CO028CL11
14874,171,The general attention redoubled.,CO028CL11
14875,172,"“Before dying,” continued Anselmo, “my dear friend handed over to me a share of his fortune; I mean most of it, because the girl received only thirty contos.” I have received from him three hundred contos, which I have kept intact to this day, and which I must restore according to the instructions of this letter.”",CO028CL11
14876,173,"A bustle of astonishment was followed by a bustle of anxiety in all. What would the mysterious will of Adelaide’s father be? Dona Antônia remembered that as a young woman she had been a girlfriend of the deceased, and for a moment she flattered herself with the idea that the old maniac had remembered her at the gates of death.",CO028CL11
14877,174,"“On this I acknowledge my brother Bento,” said the Major taking a puff. “He was the man of mysteries, surprises, and extravagant ideas, if it may be said of his sins, if he had them, without offense...”",CO028CL11
14878,175,Anselmo had opened the letter. They all listened. The veteran read the following:,CO028CL11
14879,176,My good and dearest Anselmo.,CO028CL11
14880,177,"I want you to do me the ultimate favor. You have most of my fortune with you, and I would say the best if I had to allude to my dear daughter Adelaide. Save these three hundred contos for ten years from now, and at the end of that term, read this letter before my relatives.",CO028CL11
14881,178,"If at that time my daughter Adelaide is alive and married, give her the fortune. If she is not married, also give it to her, but on one condition: that she marry my nephew Luiz Soares, my sister Luiza’s son; I esteem him very much, and although he’s rich, I wish that he be included in the possession of the fortune with my daughter. In the event that she refuses to this condition, you keep the whole fortune.",CO028CL11
14882,179,"When Anselmo finished reading this letter, there was a silence of general surprise, shared by the veteran himself, until then oblivious to the contents of the letter.",CO028CL11
14883,180,Soares had his eyes on Adelaide; she had her eyes on the floor.,CO028CL11
14884,181,"As the silence continued, Anselmo decided to break it.",CO028CL11
14885,182,"“I was unaware, as everyone,” he said, “of what this letter contains; fortunately it arrives in time to realize the last will of my late friend.”",CO028CL11
14886,183,"“No doubt about it,” said the Major.",CO028CL11
14887,184,"Hearing this, the young woman callously raised her eyes to her cousin, and hers met his. His were overflowing with contentment and tenderness; the young woman looked at them for a moment. A smile, no longer mocking, came to the young man’s lips. The young woman smiled; but what a smile! A queen had never smiled with such disdain at the groveling of a courtier.",CO028CL11
14888,185,Anselmo rose.,CO028CL11
14889,186,"“Now that you are aware,” he said to the two cousins, “I hope you’ll get things sorted out, and since the result cannot be doubtful, I congratulate you already. However, you must excuse me, I have to go elsewhere.”",CO028CL11
14890,187,With Anselmo’s departure the meeting was dispersed. Adelaide went to her room with the old female relative. The uncle and the nephew stayed in the living room.,CO028CL11
14891,188,"“Luiz,” said the former, “you are the happiest man in the world.”",CO028CL11
14892,189,"“Does it look like to you, my uncle?” said the young man, seeking to disguise his joy.",CO028CL11
14893,190,“You are. You have a young woman who loves you madly. Suddenly an unexpected fortune falls into your hands; and this fortune she can only have on the condition of marrying you. Even the dead work to your advantage.”,CO028CL11
14894,191,"“I assure you, my uncle, that the fortune weighs nothing in these cases, and if I settle for marrying my cousin, it will be for another reason.”",CO028CL11
14895,192,"“I know quite well that wealth isn’t essential; it’s not. But it’s worth something after all. It’s better to have three hundred contos than thirty; it’s always one more zero. However, I don’t advise you to marry her if you don’t have some affection. Note that I don’t mean those passions that you told me about. A bad marriage, despite wealth, is always a bad marriage.”",CO028CL11
14896,193,"“I’m convinced of it, my uncle. That’s why I haven’t yet given my answer, nor do I give it for the moment. If I come to love my cousin, I’m ready to enter into this unexpected wealth.”",CO028CL11
14897,194,"As the reader will have guessed, the resolution for the marriage was settled in Soares’s spirit. Instead of waiting for his uncle’s death, it seemed better for him to enter into possession of an excellent nest egg, which seemed to him all the easier, as it was the voice from the grave that imposed it.",CO028CL11
14898,195,Soares also counted on Adelaide’s deep veneration for her father. This in connection with the love that the young woman felt for him should produce the desired effect.,CO028CL11
14899,196,"That night the young man slept little. He dreamed of the Orient. His imagination painted a harem fragrant of the finest essences of Arabia, the floor lined with Persian rugs; on soft divans flaunted the most perfect beauties of the world. A Circassian danced in the middle of the hall to the sound of an ivory tambourine. But a furious eunuch, hurrying into the room with his yataghan unsheathed, buried it all in Soares’s chest, who awoke with the nightmare and could no longer sleep.",CO028CL11
14900,197,He got up earlier and went for a stroll until it was time for lunch and work.,CO028CL11
14901,198,Chapter V,CO028CL11
14902,199,Luiz Soares’s plan was made.,CO028CL11
14903,200,"It was a matter of surrender little by little, pretending to be defeated by Adelaide’s influence. The circumstance of the wealth made utmost discretion necessary. The transition should be slow. He had to be a diplomat.",CO028CL11
14904,201,"The readers will have seen that, despite some cleverness on Soares’s part, he had no perfect understanding of things, and on the other hand his character was indecisive and restless.",CO028CL11
14905,202,"He had hesitated to marry Adelaide when his uncle talked to him about it, when it was certain that he would later obtain the Major’s fortune. He said then that he had no vocation to be a parrot. The situation was now the same; to accept a fortune by imprisonment. It’s true that if this resolution was contrary to the first, it could have been due to the fatigue the life he was leading produced in him. Besides, this time, wealth wasn’t going to wait; it was delivered shortly after the consortium.",CO028CL11
14906,203,"“Three hundred contos,” thought the young man, “that’s enough for me to be more than I was. What won’t the others say!”",CO028CL11
14907,204,"Foreseeing a happiness that was right for him, Soares began the siege of the fortress, in fact, a surrendered fortress.",CO028CL11
14908,205,"Now the young man looked for the eyes of his cousin, now he found them, now he asked them what he had refused until then, the young woman’s love. When, at the table, their hands met, Soares was careful to delay the contact, and even if the young woman pulled away her hand, the young man wasn’t discouraged. When he was alone with her, he didn’t run away as he used to, but rather addressed her with a word, which Adelaide answered with cool politeness.",CO028CL11
14909,206,"“She wants to sell herself well,” thought Soares.",CO028CL11
14910,207,"Once he dared more. Adelaide was playing the piano when he came in without her seeing him. When the young woman was finished, Soares was behind her.",CO028CL11
14911,208,“How beautiful!” said the young man; “let me kiss your inspired hands.”,CO028CL11
14912,209,"The young woman gave him a stern look, took the handkerchief she had put on the piano, and left without a word.",CO028CL11
14913,210,"This scene showed Soares all the difficulty of the enterprise; but the young man trusted himself, not because he recognized himself as capable of great efforts, but for some kind of hope in his good star.",CO028CL11
14914,211,"“It’s difficult to go against the current,” he said, “but one goes up. No Alexanders are made in the conquest of unarmed fortresses.”",CO028CL11
14915,212,"However, the disillusionments were recurring, and the young man, if he hadn’t been encouraged by the idea of the wealth, would have surrendered.",CO028CL11
14916,213,"One day he remembered to write her a letter. He remembered that it was difficult to tell her what he felt in person; but that a letter, no matter how much hatred she had, would always be read.",CO028CL11
14917,214,"Adelaide returned the letter through the errand boy of the house, who had given it to her.",CO028CL11
14918,215,"The second letter had the same luck. When he sent the third, the errand boy didn’t want to take it.",CO028CL11
14919,216,"Luiz Soares had a moment of disillusionment. Indifferent to the young woman, he was already beginning to hate her; if he married her, he was likely to treat her as a mortal enemy.",CO028CL11
14920,217,"The situation was ridiculous for him; or beforehand, it has already been for a long time, but Soares only then understood it. To escape ridicule, he decided to deliver a final, grand, coup de grâce. He took the first opportunity he could, and made a positive statement to the young woman, full of supplications, sighs, perhaps tears. He confessed his mistakes; he acknowledged that he hadn’t understood her; but he repented and confessed everything. Her influence had finally knocked him down.",CO028CL11
14921,218,“Knock you down!” she said; “I don’t understand. What influence do you allude to?”,CO028CL11
14922,219,"“You know, to the influence of your beauty, of your love… Don’t suppose that I’m lying to you. I’m so in love today that I was capable of committing a crime!”",CO028CL11
14923,220,“A crime?”,CO028CL11
14924,221,"“Isn’t suicide a crime? What use would life make without your love? Come on, speak!”",CO028CL11
14925,222,The young woman looked at him for a moment without saying a word.,CO028CL11
14926,223,The young man knelt down.,CO028CL11
14927,224,"“Be it death, be it happiness,” he said, “I want to submit to you on my knees.”",CO028CL11
14928,225,Adelaide smiled and slowly let out these words:,CO028CL11
14929,226,“Three hundred contos! It’s too much money to buy a wretch.”,CO028CL11
14930,227,And she turned her back to him.,CO028CL11
14931,228,"Soares was petrified. For a few minutes he remained in the same position, his eyes fixed on the young woman who was slowly moving away. The young man bowed to the weight of humiliation. He hadn’t foreseen such cruel revenge on Adelaide’s part. Not a word of hatred, nor a hint of anger; only a calm disdain, a quiet and sovereign scorn. Soares had suffered greatly when he lost his fortune; but now that his pride was humbled, his pain was infinitely greater.",CO028CL11
14932,229,Poor young man!,CO028CL11
14933,230,"The young woman went inside. It seems that she counted on that scene; for when she went into the house, she immediately went looking for her uncle, and declared to him that, although she venerated her father’s memory, she couldn’t obey him, and was forsaking the marriage.",CO028CL11
14934,231,“But don’t you love him?” asked the Major.,CO028CL11
14935,232,“I loved him.”,CO028CL11
14936,233,“Do you love someone else?”,CO028CL11
14937,234,“No.”,CO028CL11
14938,235,“Then explain yourself.”,CO028CL11
14939,236,"Adelaide opened up about Soares’s conduct since he had come to the house, the change he had made, his ambition, the garden scene. The Major listened intently to the young woman; he tried to apologize for his nephew, but deep down he believed that Soares was a knave.",CO028CL11
14940,237,"The latter, when he was able to restrain his wrath, entered the house and went to say goodbye to his uncle until the next day.
He pretended he had an urgent business.",CO028CL11
14941,238,Chapter VI,CO028CL11
14942,239,"Adelaide told her father’s friend minutely of the events that had forced her not to fulfill the posthumous letter entrusted to Anselmo. As a result of this refusal, the fortune was to remain with Anselmo; the young woman was content with what she had.",CO028CL11
14943,240,"Anselmo didn’t give up, and before accepting the refusal, he went to see if he could investigate Luiz Soares’s spirit.",CO028CL11
14944,241,"When the Major’s nephew saw the farmer entering the house, he suspected it was something to do with the marriage. Anselm was perceptive; so that, despite the victim’s appearance with which Soares had appeared to him, he understood that Adelaide was right.",CO028CL11
14945,242,"So it was over. Anselmo set himself to leaving for Bahia, and so he declared to the Major’s family.",CO028CL11
14946,243,"On the eve of leaving, they were all together in the living room, when Anselmo uttered these words:",CO028CL11
14947,244,"“Major, you’re getting better and stronger; I think a trip to Europe will do you good. This young woman will also like to see Europe, and I believe that Mrs. Dona Antônia, despite her age, will want to go there. For my part, I will sacrifice Bahia and go, too. Do you approve the advice?”",CO028CL11
14948,245,"“Man,” said the Major, “I need to think…”",CO028CL11
14949,246,"“Think about what! If you think, you won’t get on board. What does the girl say?”",CO028CL11
14950,247,"“I obey my uncle,” said Adelaide.",CO028CL11
14951,248,"“Besides that,” said Anselmo, “now that Miss Adelaide is in possession of a great fortune, she might want to appreciate what is beautiful in foreign countries so that she may better evaluate what’s in ours…”",CO028CL11
14952,249,"“Yes,” said the Major; but you speak of great fortune…”",CO028CL11
14953,250,“Three hundred contos.”,CO028CL11
14954,251,“They’re yours.”,CO028CL11
14955,252,"“Mine! So am I some kind of swindler? What do I care about the fantasy of a generous friend? The money, of which I have enough, belongs to this girl, his legitimate heir, not to me.”",CO028CL11
14956,253,"“That’s beautiful, Anselmo!”",CO028CL11
14957,254,“But what would it be if it weren’t for this?”,CO028CL11
14958,255,The trip to Europe was settled.,CO028CL11
14959,256,Luiz Soares heard the whole conversation without saying a word; but the idea that he might go with his uncle smiled at his spirit. The next day he had a cruel disillusion. The Major told him that before leaving he would recommend him to the Minister.,CO028CL11
14960,257,"Soares tried to see if he was still able to go with the family. Was it simple covetousness in his uncle’s fortune, a desire to see new lands, or an impulse of revenge against his cousin? It was all that, maybe.",CO028CL11
14961,258,At the last hour the last hope came to an end. The family left without him.,CO028CL11
14962,259,"Abandoned, poor, having only day-to-day work, no hope in the future, and, moreover, humiliated and wounded in his self-esteem, Soares took the sad resolution of cowards.",CO028CL11
14963,260,"One night the servant heard a shot in his room, ran, and found a corpse.",CO028CL11
14964,261,"Pires heard the news in the street and ran to Victoria’s house, who he found at her dressing table.",CO028CL11
14965,262,“Do you know what?” He asked.,CO028CL11
14966,263,“No. What is it?”,CO028CL11
14967,264,“Soares killed himself.”,CO028CL11
14968,265,“When?”,CO028CL11
14969,266,“Right now.”,CO028CL11
14970,267,“Poor thing! Really?”,CO028CL11
14971,268,“Really. Are you going out?”,CO028CL11

14978,2,I,CO033CL08
14979,3,"One night, slightly irritated at the lady who occupied my thoughts, I found myself at a loss and with no desire to pass the time cheerfully, as you ought to do in such situations. I didn’t want to go home because that would be going into battle with loneliness and rumination, two mistresses who take it on themselves to put an end to all fits of sentimental irritation.",CO033CL08
14980,4,"There was a show at the Teatro de São Pedro. I didn’t want to know what play was being put on; I bought a ticket for the stalls and went to give it a look just as the curtains were rising for the start of the first act. The act was promising; it started with a murder and ended with an oath. There was a girl who didn’t know her mother or father, and she was abducted by a person wrapped in a cape I suspected was the girl’s mother or father. There was vague talk of a disguised marquis, and there was foreshadowing of a second and coming murder in the person of an old countess. The act ended to a lot of applause.",CO033CL08
14981,5,"As soon as the curtain dropped, there was the usual fracas; the audience members marked their seats and went out for air. I, who was fortunately in a spot where I couldn’t be bothered, stretched my legs out and started looking in the direction of the grand drape, on which my peeved lady, through no effort of my own, appeared with closed fists and threatening me with furious eyes.",CO033CL08
14982,6,"“What do you think of the play, senhor Amaral?”",CO033CL08
14983,7,"I turned in the direction from which I heard my name spoken. To my left was an individual, older already, wearing a military tunic and smiling pleasantly at me.",CO033CL08
14984,8,"“Are you surprised I know your name,” the individual asked.",CO033CL08
14985,9,"“I am indeed,” I replied; “I don’t recall having seen you. . . .”",CO033CL08
14986,10,"“You’ve never seen me; I got here yesterday from Rio Grande do Sul. I haven’t ever seen you, either, and yet I recognized you right away.”",CO033CL08
14987,11,"“I can guess,” I replied; “people tell me I look a lot like my father. You know him, right?”",CO033CL08
14988,12,“Of course. We were brothers in arms. In the army Colonel Amaral and Captain Mendonça passed for being the very picture of friendship.”,CO033CL08
14989,13,“I remember now that my father talked a lot to me about a Captain Mendonça.”,CO033CL08
14990,14,“I am that captain.”,CO033CL08
14991,15,“He would talk to me with a lot of enthusiasm; he would say you were his closest and most loyal friend.”,CO033CL08
14992,16,"“The colonel was unjust,” said the captain, opening a box of snuff. “I was more than that. I was the only loyal friend he had. But your father was guarded; maybe he didn’t want to offend anyone. Your father was a bit frail; the only fight we ever got into was because I called him foolish one night. The colonel reacted, but he was finally convinced. . . . Do you want a pinch?”",CO033CL08
14993,17,“Thank you.”,CO033CL08
14994,18,"I was surprised that my father’s most loyal friend should be treating his memory so contemptuously, and I then started having my doubts about the friendship that had bound them in the army. These doubts were made even more serious by the recollection that my father, when he talked about Captain Mendonça, would say he was a good man . . . with a screw loose.",CO033CL08
14995,19,"I observed the captain as he took his pinch of snuff and wiped his shirt, lightly spotted by a classic and legitimate drip, with his handkerchief. He was a man of fine appearance, with a military bearing, a slightly absent gaze, and a beard up to his temples and running beneath his chin, as befits a self-respecting army officer. His clothes were brand new; the old captain was evidently above life’s necessities.",CO033CL08
14996,20,"The facial expression wasn’t bad, but the absent gaze and the bushy and protruding eyebrows tainted the rest.",CO033CL08
14997,21,"We chatted about the past; the captain talked to me about the campaign against Rosas and the part my father played in it. His way of talking was lively and picturesque; he recalled several incidents, interspersing everything with funny stories.",CO033CL08
14998,22,"After twenty minutes the audience started getting uncomfortable about the length of the intermission, and the orchestra of heels played a symphony of despair.",CO033CL08
14999,23,"Just then a person came to call the captain to a box. The captain wanted to save the visit for the next intermission, but since the person insisted, he gave in and shook my hand.",CO033CL08
15000,24,"“See you later,” he said.",CO033CL08
15001,25,"I was alone again; heelpieces gave way to fiddles, and the second act began a few minutes later.",CO033CL08
15002,26,"Since it wasn’t doing me any good as either amusement or occupation, I settled in as best I could and closed my eyes, listening to a soliloquy from the lead, who broke both your heart and the rules of grammar.",CO033CL08
15003,27,Before long I was roused by the captain’s voice. I opened my eyes and saw him on foot.,CO033CL08
15004,28,“Do you want to hear about something?” he asked. “I’m going to have dinner. Will you join me?”,CO033CL08
15005,29,"“I can’t. Please excuse me,” I replied.",CO033CL08
15006,30,"“I will accept no excuses; pretend I’m the colonel and I’m saying: Kid, let’s eat!”",CO033CL08
15007,31,“But I’m expecting—”,CO033CL08
15008,32,“You’re not expecting anyone.”,CO033CL08
15009,33,"The exchange provoked some muttering around use. In view of the captain’s Amphitryonic mood, I considered it advisable to go with him to keep from causing a scene.",CO033CL08
15010,34,We left.,CO033CL08
15011,35,"“Having dinner at this time,” said the captain, “isn’t suitable for a young fellow like you, but I am old and an officer.”",CO033CL08
15012,36,I didn’t reply.,CO033CL08
15013,37,"To tell the truth, I wasn’t interested in the theater or anything else; I wanted to kill time. Although I wasn’t moved by any sympathy for the captain, the way he spoke to me and his having been a fellow officer of my father’s made it that his company was more acceptable to me just then than anyone else’s.",CO033CL08
15014,38,"In addition to all those reasons, the life I was leading was so monotonous that Captain Mendonça, that diversion, ought to fill a good page with new material. I call Captain Mendonça a diversion because there was something or other that struck me as eccentric and original in my companion’s carriage and in his gaze. Is it not a great stroke of luck to find an original in the midst of all the copies human life is full of?",CO033CL08
15015,39,"For that reason, then, I went with my captain, who went on talking over the entire walk, barely getting more than an occasional monosyllable out of me.",CO033CL08
15016,40,We later stopped in front of an old and dark house.,CO033CL08
15017,41,"“Let’s go in,” said Mendonça.",CO033CL08
15018,42,“What street is this?” I asked.,CO033CL08
15019,43,"“You don’t know? Oh, you sure have your head in the clouds! This is Rua da Guarda Velha.”",CO033CL08
15020,44,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO033CL08
15021,45,The old man knocked three times; a few seconds later the door creaked on its hinges and we stepped into a dark and damp hallway.,CO033CL08
15022,46,"“You didn’t bring a light, then?” Mendonça asked someone I couldn’t see.",CO033CL08
15023,47,“I came in a rush.”,CO033CL08
15024,48,"“Fine; close the door. Give us your hand, senhor Amaral. This entry hall is a little odd, but once we go up we’ll be better off.”",CO033CL08
15025,49,I gave him my hand.,CO033CL08
15026,50,"“It’s shaking,” said Captain Mendonça.",CO033CL08
15027,51,I was indeed shaking; for the first time the suspicion went through my mind that my father’s supposed friend was just a thief and that the house was a rat-trap set up for fools.,CO033CL08
15028,52,"But it was too late to turn back; showing fear would be worse. For that reason, then, I replied cheerfully:",CO033CL08
15029,53,"“You think a person going into a hall like this one, which, forgive me, looks like the hallway to hell, doesn’t have a reason to shake?”",CO033CL08
15030,54,"“You almost got it right,” said the captain, guiding me up the stairs.",CO033CL08
15031,55,“Almost?”,CO033CL08
15032,56,"“Yes, it’s purgatory, not hell.”",CO033CL08
15033,57,"I shuddered on hearing those words; my blood rushed to my heart, which started racing. The strangeness of the captain’s appearance, the strangeness of the house—everything combined to fill me with terror. Luckily, we made it upstairs and went into a room lit by gas lamps and furnished like all the houses of this world.",CO033CL08
15034,58,"As a joke, and to preserve my independence of mind whole, I said with a smile:",CO033CL08
15035,59,"“Great, purgatory looks good; instead of furnaces there are sofas.”",CO033CL08
15036,60,"“My good sir,” replied the captain, staring at me, something he was doing for the first time, since his gaze was always cockeyed; “my good sir, if you think you’re going to get my secret out of me that way, you’re very much mistaken. I invited you to dinner; be satisfied with that.”",CO033CL08
15037,61,"I didn’t answer; the captain’s words dispelled my suspicions about the reason he had taken me there, but they created other impressions. I suspected the captain was crazy, and the slightest incident confirmed my suspicions.",CO033CL08
15038,62,"“Moleque!” said the captain, and when the boy appeared he went on: “Make dinner; get wine from case number twenty-five; go on, I want everything ready in a quarter of an hour.”",CO033CL08
15039,63,"The boy left to carry out Mendonça’s orders. The latter, turning to me, said:",CO033CL08
15040,64,“Have a seat and take a look at some of these books. I’m going to change.”,CO033CL08
15041,65,“You’re not going back to the theater?” I asked.,CO033CL08
15042,66,“No.”,CO033CL08
15043,67,II,CO033CL08
15044,68,"A few minutes later we were headed for the dining room, which was to the back of the house. The dinner was filling and tasty. Towering in the center was a superb cold roast; savory pies, sweets, old bottles of wine rounded out the captain’s dinner.",CO033CL08
15045,69,"“It’s a feast,” I said.",CO033CL08
15046,70,“This? It’s an ordinary dinner. . . . It’s nothing.”,CO033CL08
15047,71,There were three chairs.,CO033CL08
15048,72,"“Have a seat here,” he said, showing me the middle one and taking a seat himself in the one to my left. I realized there was more than one guest, but I didn’t ask. There was no need to, either; a few seconds later a tall and pale girl who greeted me and headed for the chair to my right came in through the door in front.",CO033CL08
15049,73,"I rose, and the captain introduced me to the girl, who was his daughter, Augusta by name.",CO033CL08
15050,74,"I admit that the girl’s presence reassured me a bit. Not only because I was no longer alone with such a strange man as Captain Mendonça but also because the girl’s presence in that house suggested that if, as I suspected, the captain was mad, he was at least a harmless madman.",CO033CL08
15051,75,"I tried to be attentive to my neighbor to my right, while the captain carved the fish with a skill and dexterity that clearly revealed his proficiency in the culinary arts.",CO033CL08
15052,76,"“We should be friends,” I said to Augusta, “since our fathers were, too.”",CO033CL08
15053,77,"Augusta turned two most beautiful green eyes on me. Then she smiled and lowered her gaze with a look of elegance or modesty, since it could have been either. I observed her in that position; it was a beautiful, perfectly formed head, a fair profile, fine skin, long lashes, and blond hair, an aureate splendor, as poets call the sun.",CO033CL08
15054,78,"In the meantime, Mendonça had finished his task and started to serve us. Augusta was toying with her knife, perhaps to show me the slenderness of her hand and the shapeliness of her arm.",CO033CL08
15055,79,"“Have you been struck dumb, Augusta?” the captain asked, serving her fish.",CO033CL08
15056,80,"“I’m sad, papai.”",CO033CL08
15057,81,"“Sad? What’s wrong, then?”",CO033CL08
15058,82,“I don’t know. I’m sad for no reason.”,CO033CL08
15059,83,"Sadness without a cause often means boredom. I translated what the girl said that way, and it hurt my pride, for no good reason, for the rest. To buck the girl up I tried to make the situation more cheerful. I overlooked the state of mind of the father, who struck me as profoundly unstable, and started talking as if we were old friends.",CO033CL08
15060,84,"Augusta seemed to be enjoying the talk; the captain, too, started laughing like a man of sound judgment. I was having one of my finest days; witty remarks and a quip or two came to my aid. A child of my time, I gave myself over to plays on words, and with such felicity that the girl and her father were inspired to follow my lead.",CO033CL08
15061,85,By the time dinner was over we were like old friends.,CO033CL08
15062,86,“You want to go back to the theater?” the captain asked me.,CO033CL08
15063,87,"“Of course not,” I replied.",CO033CL08
15064,88,“You mean you prefer being with us . . . or with Augusta.”,CO033CL08
15065,89,"This frank remark of the old man’s struck me as slightly indiscreet. I am sure I blushed. The same thing didn’t befall Augusta, who said with a smile:",CO033CL08
15066,90,"“If that’s the way it is, I owe him nothing, because I, too, prefer his company to the finest show on earth.”",CO033CL08
15067,91,"Augusta’s frankness surprised me even more than Mendonça’s. But it wasn’t easy to immerse myself in profound thought while the girl’s beautiful green eyes were looking into mine, as if saying to me:",CO033CL08
15068,92,“Keep on being good-natured.”,CO033CL08
15069,93,"“Let’s go to the other room,” said the captain, rising.",CO033CL08
15070,94,"We did the same. I gave Augusta my arm as the captain led us to the other room, which was not the reception room. Except for the old man, who went to light a cigarette at one of the candles from the candelabrum, we sat down, and I took a quick look around the room, which struck me as altogether strange. The furniture was old, not just in its style but also in its years. In the middle was a big, round table covered with a green mat. Stuffed animals were hanging on one of the walls. On the wall opposite that one was nothing but an owl, likewise stuffed, and with green glass eyes that, though immobile, seemed to follow all the movements you made.",CO033CL08
15071,95,"My fears came back to me here. In the meantime, I took a look at Augusta, and she looked at me. That girl was the only tie between the world and me, because everything in that house struck me as truly unreal, and by this time I no longer had any doubts about the purgatorial character the captain had mentioned to me.",CO033CL08
15072,96,"We were silent for a few minutes; the captain was smoking, pacing with his hands behind his back, a posture that could indicate the meditation of a philosopher or the unresponsiveness of a fool.",CO033CL08
15073,97,"All at once he stopped in front of us, smiled, and asked me:",CO033CL08
15074,98,“Don’t you think this girl is beautiful?”,CO033CL08
15075,99,"“Very beautiful,” I replied.",CO033CL08
15076,100,"“What pretty eyes they are, aren’t they?”",CO033CL08
15077,101,"“Very pretty indeed, and unusual.”",CO033CL08
15078,102,"“This creation does me credit, doesn’t it?”",CO033CL08
15079,103,"I replied with an approving smile. Augusta, for her part, merely said with adorable simplicity:",CO033CL08
15080,104,“Papai is vainer than I am; he likes saying I’m pretty. Who doesn’t realize that?”,CO033CL08
15081,105,"“You’ll note,” the captain, sitting down, said to me, “that this girl is too frank for her sex and her age. . . .”",CO033CL08
15082,106,“I don’t find anything wrong with her. . . .”,CO033CL08
15083,107,“None of these dodges now; it’s the truth. Augusta isn’t like other girls who think very highly of themselves but smile when someone pays them a complement and wrinkle their brow when no one does.”,CO033CL08
15084,108,"“I would say she is an adorable exception,” I replied, smiling at the girl, who thanked me with a smile she, too.",CO033CL08
15085,109,"“That’s it,” said her father; “but a complete exception.”",CO033CL08
15086,110,"“A reasoned upbringing,” I went on, “can very well—”",CO033CL08
15087,111,"“Not just the upbringing,” put in Mendonça, “but the origin, too. The origin is everything, or nearly everything.”",CO033CL08
15088,112,"I didn’t understand what the man meant. Augusta seemed to, since she started looking at the ceiling with a malicious smile. I took a look at the captain; the captain was looking at the owl.",CO033CL08
15089,113,"The conversation got lively again for a few minutes, after which the captain, who seemed to be obsessed, asked me:",CO033CL08
15090,114,"“You think those eyes are pretty, then?”",CO033CL08
15091,115,“I already told you; they’re as beautiful as they are unusual.”,CO033CL08
15092,116,“You want me to give them to you?” asked the old man.,CO033CL08
15093,117,I bent my head.,CO033CL08
15094,118,"“I’d be delighted to possess such rare gifts,” I said, “but—”",CO033CL08
15095,119,"“No standing on ceremony; if you like, I’ll give them to you; otherwise, I’ll just show them to you.”",CO033CL08
15096,120,"So saying, the captain stood up and went over to Augusta, who looked down at his hands. The old man made a slight gesture, the girl looked up, and the old man presented me the girl’s two beautiful eyes in his hands.",CO033CL08
15097,121,"I looked at Augusta. It was horrible. In place of her eyes, she had two big holes like a skull’s. I will refrain from describing what I felt; I was unable to let out a shout; I went ice-cold. The girl’s head was the most hideous thing imaginable; imagine a living, speaking, smiling skull looking at me with two empty sockets in which, shortly before, were set the most beautiful eyes in the world. The eye sockets seemed to see me; the girl was contemplating my fright with an angelic smile.",CO033CL08
15098,122,"“Take a close look at them,” said the old man, in front of me; “feel them; tell me if you’ve ever seen anything so well made.”",CO033CL08
15099,123,"What could I do but obey him? I looked at the eyes the old man had in his hand. Here it was worse; the two eyes were fixed on me, seemed to perceive me no less than the empty orbits in the girl’s face. Life hadn’t left them when they were removed from the face. The retina had the same light and the same reflexes. That way, the old man’s hands looked at me as if they were a face.",CO033CL08
15100,124,"I don’t know how much time went by; the captain went back over to Augusta. She looked down, and the old man put the eyes back in their place.",CO033CL08
15101,125,It was all horrible.,CO033CL08
15102,126,"“You’re pale!” said Augusta, forcing me to look her way and to find her back in her earlier state.",CO033CL08
15103,127,"“Obviously,” I stammered. “I’m seeing. . . .”",CO033CL08
15104,128,“Unbelievable things?” asked the captain.,CO033CL08
15105,129,"“Exactly, unbelievable,” I replied. “I didn’t think—”",CO033CL08
15106,130,"“That’s nothing!” burst out the captain. “And I’m really delighted you think these trifles you saw are unbelievable, because that’s a sign that I am going to amaze the world.”",CO033CL08
15107,131,"I took my handkerchief out to wipe off the beads of sweat that were rolling off me. Augusta, meanwhile, got up and left the room.",CO033CL08
15108,132,“You see how gracefully she moves?” asked the captain. “That’s all my doing. . . . It’s the result of my studies.”,CO033CL08
15109,133,“Ah!”,CO033CL08
15110,134,"“It’s true. For now, she’s my first production, and I don’t think anything needs to be said; you at least seem to be delighted. . . .”",CO033CL08
15111,135,"I lowered my head in assent. What could I, poor defenseless mortal, do against a man and a girl who seemed to me to have at their disposal strengths unknown to man?",CO033CL08
15112,136,"All my efforts went to getting out of that house, but in a way that wouldn’t annoy them. I wished hours had handles, but it’s in horrible predicaments that they inevitably go by most slowly. I cursed my irritation, which was the reason for my encounter with an individual of this ilk.",CO033CL08
15113,137,"The captain, it seems, sensed those thoughts of mine, because, after a brief silence, he went on:",CO033CL08
15114,138,"“You must be delighted, if a bit frightened and sorry for your acquiescence. But that’s being childish. You didn’t lose anything by coming here; on the contrary, you end up knowing things the world will know sooner or later. Don’t you think that’s better?”",CO033CL08
15115,139,"“Yes,” I replied, not knowing what I was saying.",CO033CL08
15116,140,"“Augusta,” the captain went on, “is my inaugural effort. She is a chemical product; it took me three years to give that miracle to the world; but perseverance overcomes all, and I have a tenacious character. The first assays were failures. Three times the girl, always flawed, emerged from my alembics. The fourth time was a feat of science. When that perfection appeared I dropped to her feet. The creator was admiring his creation!”",CO033CL08
15117,141,"My eyes must have been expressing shock, because the old man said:",CO033CL08
15118,142,"“I see you are frightened by all of this, and that’s only natural. What could you know of such things?”",CO033CL08
15119,143,"He rose, took a few steps, and sat back down. The houseboy came in carrying coffee just then.",CO033CL08
15120,144,"The boy’s presence heartened me. I imagined that he was the only genuine human creature in there I could come to an understanding with. I started making signs at him, but I didn’t manage to make myself understood. The boy left, and I was alone with my interlocutor.",CO033CL08
15121,145,"“Drink your coffee, my friend,” he said to me, seeing that I was hesitating, not because I was afraid, but because I really didn’t feel like drinking anything at all.",CO033CL08
15122,146,I obeyed as I could.,CO033CL08
15123,147,III,CO033CL08
15124,148,Augusta returned to the room.,CO033CL08
15125,149,The old man turned around to look at her; no father ever gazed on his daughter more lovingly than he did. It was clear that his love was intensified by pride. In the captain’s gaze was a certain arrogance that doesn’t usually accompany paternal tenderness.,CO033CL08
15126,150,He wasn’t a father—he was a creator.,CO033CL08
15127,151,"The girl, for her part, seemed proud of herself as well. She clearly sensed how much her father admired her. She was aware that all of the old man’s pride was placed in her, and in exchange she put all of her pride in the author of her days. If the Odyssey had the same form, it would feel the same way when Homer gazed on it.",CO033CL08
15128,152,"What an odd thing! That woman, despite her mysterious and diabolical origins, made an impression on me. By her side, I experienced a new feeling, whether love, admiration, or inevitable sympathy I don’t know.",CO033CL08
15129,153,"When she turned her eyes on me, it was hard for me to look away, and yet I had seen her most lovely eyes in her father’s hands, I had gazed in terror at sockets empty like the eyes of death.",CO033CL08
15130,154,"The night, though slowly, was advancing. Little by little, the noise from outside was dying down. We were entering the complete silence that tallied so dismally with the room I found myself in and with the people I was talking to.",CO033CL08
15131,155,The natural thing was for me to go. I stood up and begged leave of the captain.,CO033CL08
15132,156,"“It’s still early,” he replied.",CO033CL08
15133,157,“But I’ll come back tomorrow.”,CO033CL08
15134,158,"“Come back tomorrow and anytime you like, but today it’s still early. It’s not everywhere you’ll come across a man like me, a brother to God, a god on earth, since I, too, am a creator like Him, or an even better one, because I made Augusta, and He doesn’t always make creatures like her; the Hottentots, for example. . . .”",CO033CL08
15135,159,"“But,” I said, “people are expecting me.”",CO033CL08
15136,160,"“Maybe,” said the captain with a smile, “but for now you’re not going anywhere.”",CO033CL08
15137,161,“Why not?” broke in Augusta. “He ought to be able to go on condition that he comes back tomorrow.”,CO033CL08
15138,162,“I’ll come back.”,CO033CL08
15139,163,“Do you promise me?”,CO033CL08
15140,164,“I promise.”,CO033CL08
15141,165,Augusta gave me her hand.,CO033CL08
15142,166,"“A promise, then!” she said. “But if you break it. . . .”",CO033CL08
15143,167,"“You’ll die,” added the father.",CO033CL08
15144,168,"I felt a chill on hearing Mendonça’s final words. At the same time, I left, taking my leave as cheerfully and cordially as I could.",CO033CL08
15145,169,"“Come at night,” said the captain.",CO033CL08
15146,170,"“See you tomorrow,” I replied.",CO033CL08
15147,171,When I made it out I breathed deeply. I was free. That torment I had never imagined was over. I picked up my gait and was back home half an hour later.,CO033CL08
15148,172,"It was impossible for me to get to sleep. I was constantly seeing my captain with Augusta’s eyes in his hands, and the image of the girl was wafting through the haze of my imagination like a creature out of Ossian.",CO033CL08
15149,173,"Who was that man? That girl? Was the girl really a chemical product of the old man’s? Both had said so, and to a certain extent I had proof of it. I could have assumed they were crazy, but that business with the eyes put paid to that idea. Was I still in the world of the living or had I already begun to enter the territory of dreams and the unknown?",CO033CL08
15150,174,"My strength of character alone enabled me to stand up to such ordeals. A weaker man would have gone mad, which would have been just as well. What made my situation more trying and more impossible to endure was the utter soundness of my mind. The torment I found myself in stemmed from the conflict between my mind and my senses; my eyes saw, and my mind took exception. How to reconcile that evidence and that disbelief?",CO033CL08
15151,175,"I didn’t sleep. The next day I greeted the sun like an eagerly awaited friend. I saw I was in my room. The servant brought me lunch, which was made up entirely of things of this world. I went over to the window and caught sight of the building of the Chamber of Deputies; it was all I needed to see. I was still on earth, and still on earth was that blasted captain, not to mention his daughter.",CO033CL08
15152,176,At that point I reflected.,CO033CL08
15153,177,"Maybe I could manage to reconcile everything. I went back over all the claims for chemistry and alchemy. A fantastic story of Hoffmann’s in which an alchemist asserts he has discovered the secret to producing human beings occurred to me. Could the romantic creation of bygone times not be today’s reality? And if the captain was right, would it not be to my great credit to announce it to the world?",CO033CL08
15154,178,"In all men there’s something of the hanger-on. I confess that, foreseeing the captain’s triumph, I admonished myself to cling to the coattails of his immortality. Believing in the man’s doings was hard, but who believed Galileo? How many people believed Columbus? Today’s disbelief is tomorrow’s consecration. The truth unknown is not any less true. It is true not by public acclamation, but for itself. The thought of those stars astronomers are discovering now, even though they went extinct centuries earlier, occurred to me.",CO033CL08
15155,179,"Nonsensical thoughts or not, the fact is they were mine, and it was as much because of them as because of my fascination with the girl’s gaze that I turned up at the captain’s house on Rua da Guarda Velha as soon as night fell.",CO033CL08
15156,180,The captain was expecting me.,CO033CL08
15157,181,"“I stayed in on purpose,” he told me. “I was counting on your coming, and I wanted to show you a chemical composition. I spent the whole day getting the ingredients ready.”",CO033CL08
15158,182,"Augusta welcomed me with truly adorable grace. I kissed her hand the way people did with ladies in the old days, a custom that has been replaced by the handshake, as befits, for the rest, a solemn age.",CO033CL08
15159,183,"“I missed you,” she said to me.",CO033CL08
15160,184,“Did you?”,CO033CL08
15161,185,“I bet you didn’t miss me.”,CO033CL08
15162,186,“But I did.”,CO033CL08
15163,187,“I don’t believe you.”,CO033CL08
15164,188,“Why not?”,CO033CL08
15165,189,"“Because I am not an illegitimate daughter. All other women are illegitimate daughters, and I alone can take pride in being a legitimate child, as I am a daughter of science and of man’s will.”",CO033CL08
15166,190,"Augusta’s language surprised me no less than her beauty. It was clearly her father who gave her such ideas. The theory she had just enunciated was as unreal as her birth. The fact is that the atmosphere of that house was putting me in the same state of mind as its two inhabitants. It was for that reason, then, that a few seconds later I replied:",CO033CL08
15167,191,"“No matter how much I may admire the captain’s knowledge, he still hasn’t done anything other than apply elements from nature to a being that until now seemed impervious to the effects of chemical reagents and laboratory instruments.”",CO033CL08
15168,192,"“You’re partly right,” said the captain, “but does that make me any less admirable?”",CO033CL08
15169,193,"“On the contrary, and no mortal can boast of having equaled you.”",CO033CL08
15170,194,"Augusta smiled, thanking me. I made a mental note of the smile, and the action apparently showed on my face, because the captain, likewise smiling, said:",CO033CL08
15171,195,"“The product, as you can see, turned out perfect after several trials. The last trial but one was complete, but one thing was missing, and I wanted it to be as complete as what the Other Fellow did.”",CO033CL08
15172,196,"“What was missing, then?” I asked.",CO033CL08
15173,197,"“You don’t see,” went on the captain, “how Augusta smiles with satisfaction when someone refers to her beauty?”",CO033CL08
15174,198,“It’s true.”,CO033CL08
15175,199,"“Well, then, the last Augusta but one to emerge from my laboratory didn’t do that; I had forgotten to give her pride. The product would have done, and for a lot of people, I’d say, it would be even better than this one. But I don’t think so. What I wanted to do was produce a creation like the Other Fellow’s. For that reason, then, I boiled everything down to its earlier state and tried to add a greater dose of mercury to the mix.”",CO033CL08
15176,200,"I don’t think my expression betrayed me just then; but my mind made a face. I was willing to believe in Augusta’s chemical origins, but on hearing the particulars of her makeup I had my doubts.",CO033CL08
15177,201,"The captain went on, looking first at me, then at his daughter, who looked as if she were in raptures on hearing her father’s story:",CO033CL08
15178,202,"“You know that the ancients called chemistry the science of Hermes, among other names. I need not remind you that Hermes is the Greek name for Mercury, and mercury is the name of a chemical element. To make consciousness part of the makeup of a human being, you put an ounce of mercury in the alembic. For pride, you double the dose, because pride, in my opinion, is nothing more than the amplification of consciousness; the contraction of consciousness I call modesty.”",CO033CL08
15179,203,"“You think, then,” I said, “that the proud man is someone who received a large dose of mercury?”",CO033CL08
15180,204,“Without a doubt. It can’t be anything else. Man is a blend of molecules and chemical elements; whoever knows how to bring them together has attained everything.”,CO033CL08
15181,205,“Everything?”,CO033CL08
15182,206,"“You’re right, not everything, because the great secret consists of a discovery that I made and that is, you could say, the principle of life. I will go to my grave with it.”",CO033CL08
15183,207,“Why don’t you publicize it for the betterment of humanity?”,CO033CL08
15184,208,The captain shrugged contemptuously; it was the only answer I got.,CO033CL08

15187,211,"“Doctor,” the captain said to me once we had finished our tea, “I set up an experiment in your honor today. You know that diamonds are nothing more than crystallized coal. A long time ago a learned chemist tried to turn coal into diamonds, and I read in a magazine article that he had managed to concoct no more than a bit of diamond. I managed the rest; I’ll show you a lump of coal and I’ll transform it into a fine diamond.”",CO033CL08

15195,219,"I confess that, despite my curiosity, altogether natural in a scholar, my attention was divided between the father’s chemistry and the daughter’s charms. Augusta, in fact, had a stupendous look about her; when she entered the laboratory she breathed deeply and with pleasure, the way you breathe the fragrant air of the country. You could tell it was her native air. I took her hand, and with that naturalness typical of innocent modesty, she pulled my hand toward her, pressed it between hers, and left them in her lap. The captain went by us just then; he saw us and tittered.",CO033CL08

15198,222,"In the meantime, the captain was busying himself turning the coal into diamond. From time to time, to keep from hurting the inventor’s pride, I said something to him, to which he always responded. My mind, for all that, was on Augusta alone. I couldn’t hide it any longer; I was in love with her. And the feeling, into the bargain, was mutual. Marriage would be the natural outcome of this affinity. But could I get married and still be a good Christian? This thought unsettled me slightly. Pangs of conscience!",CO033CL08
15199,223,"The girl was a chemical product; her sole baptism was a sulfur bath. That man’s knowledge explained everything, but my conscience recoiled. Why? Augusta was as beautiful as other women—maybe more beautiful—for the same reason that the painted leaf of a tree is more beautiful than a natural leaf. She was a work of art; her creator’s skill stripped the human species of its flaws to create an ideal model, a unique specimen. Ay, woe is me! It was that very ideality that, to the eyes of the world, would keep us apart.",CO033CL08

What made more of an impression on me than anything else just then was the girl. I wouldn’t have traded her for all the most famous diamonds in the world. Every hour I spent with her intensified my fascination. I felt the delirium of love overrunning me; one more day, and I would be overwhelmingly bound to that woman. Separating would have been the death of me.",CO033CL08

15388,52,"Despite Sinhá Rita’s natural joviality and his own naturally playful self, Damião felt less happy over supper than he had earlier on. He had no confidence in his spineless godfather.

15391,55,"Once the pupils had finished their supper, they returned to their lace-making pillows. Sinhá Rita presided over this gaggle of women, some of whom were resident and others not. The whisper of bobbins and the chatter of the ladies were such worldly sounds, so far removed from theology and Latin, that the boy let himself be carried along by them and forgot about everything else.",CO188CL10
15392,56,"At first the ladies were a little shy, but soon recovered. One of them sang a popular ballad accompanied on the guitar by Sinhá Rita, and the evening passed quickly. Before the soirée ended, Sinhá Rita asked Damião to tell them the story she had particularly liked. The same one that had made Lucrécia laugh.",CO188CL10

15394,58,"Damião had no option but to obey. Despite the expectation created by Sinhá Rita’s words—which rather diminished the joke and its effect—the story did nevertheless make the ladies laugh. Pleased with himself, Damião glanced over at Lucrécia to see if she had laughed as well, but she had her head bent over her work, intent now on finishing her task. She certainly wasn’t laughing, or perhaps only to herself, in the same way she kept her cough to herself.",CO188CL10
15395,59,"The ladies left, and darkness fell. Damião’s heart also grew blacker with the onset of night. What would be happening at his father’s house? Every few minutes he went over to peer out of the window, but returned each time feeling more discouraged. No sign of his godfather. His father had doubtless sent him packing, then summoned a couple of slaves and gone to the police station to demand that a constable come with him to arrest his son and take him back to the seminary.",CO188CL10
15396,60,"Damião asked Sinhá Rita if there was a back entrance to the house and ran out into the garden to see if he could climb over the wall. He also asked if there was an escape route down Rua da Vala or if she could perhaps speak to one of her neighbors, who might be kind enough to take him in. The problem was his cassock: could Sinhá Rita lend him a jacket or an old overcoat? Sinhá Rita did indeed have a jacket, left behind by João Carneiro, either as a souvenir or out of sheer absentmindedness.",CO188CL10
15397,61,"“I have an old jacket of my husband’s,” she said, laughing, “but why are you so frightened? It will all work out, don’t you worry.”",CO188CL10
15398,62,"At last, when night had fallen, a slave arrived bearing a letter for Sinhá Rita from his godfather. No agreement had yet been reached; the father had reacted furiously and tried to smash everything in the room; he had roared out his disapproval, saying that if his lazy rapscallion of a son refused to go back to the seminary, he would have him thrown in jail or sent to the prison ship.",CO188CL10
15399,63,"João Carneiro had battled very hard to persuade Damião’s father not to rush into a decision, but to sleep on it and ponder deeply whether it was right to give the Church such a rebellious, immoral child. He explained in the letter that he had only used such language as a way of winning the argument. Not that he considered the argument won, by any means, but tomorrow he would go and see the man again and try to win him around. He concluded by saying that, meanwhile, the boy could stay at his house.",CO188CL10
15400,64,"Damião finished reading the letter and looked at Sinhá Rita. She’s my last hope, he thought. Sinhá Rita ordered a bottle of ink to be brought, and she wrote this response on the bottom half of João Carneiro’s letter: “My dear Joãozinho, either you save the boy or you’ll never see me again.” She sealed the letter with glue and gave it to the slave for him to deliver with all speed. She again tried to cheer up the reluctant seminarian, who had again donned the monkish hood of humility and consternation. She told him not to worry, that she would sort things out.",CO188CL10

15402,66,"It was time to collect in the lace work. Sinhá Rita examined each piece, and all the girls had completed their daily task. Only Lucrécia was still at her lace-making pillow, furiously working the bobbins, even though it was too dark to see. Sinhá Rita went over to her, saw that the work was unfinished, and flew into a rage, seizing her by one ear.",CO188CL10

15412,76,"The cane was next to the sofa. From the other side of the room, Sinhá Rita, not wanting to let the girl go, shouted to Damião.",CO188CL10

Why couldn’t she ask him to walk in the rain all the way to Tijuca or Jacarepaguá?",CO188CL12
15461,43,"But to persuade a father to change his mind about his son’s career . . . He knew the boy’s father well, and knew that he was perfectly capable of smashing a glass in his face. Ah, if only the boy would just drop down dead of an apoplectic fit! That would be a solution—cruel, yes, but final.",CO188CL12
15462,44,“What do you say?” demanded Sinhá Rita.,CO188CL12
15463,45,"He made a gesture as if asking for more time. He stroked his beard, looking for some way out. A papal decree dissolving the Church or, at the very least, abolishing all seminaries, that would do the trick.",CO188CL12
15464,46,"João Carneiro could then go home and enjoy a quiet game of cards. It was like asking Napoleon’s barber to lead the Battle of Austerlitz . . . Alas, the Church was still there, so were the seminaries, and his godson was still standing waiting by the wall, eyes downcast, with no convenient apoplectic fit in sight.",CO188CL12
15465,47,"“Go on, off you go,” said Sinhá Rita, handing him his hat and cane.",CO188CL12
15466,48,"There was nothing for it. The barber put away his razor, buckled on his sword, and went off to battle. Damião breathed more easily, although, outwardly, he remained grave-faced, eyes fixed on the floor. This time, Sinhá Rita pinched his chin.",CO188CL12
15467,49,"“Come on, don’t be so glum, let’s have something to eat.”",CO188CL12

15469,51,"“He has to,” retorted Sinhá Rita proudly. “Come along, the soup’s getting cold.”",CO188CL12
15470,52,"Despite Sinhá Rita’s natural joviality and his own naturally playful self, Damião felt less happy over supper than he had earlier on. He had no confidence in his spineless godfather. Nevertheless, he ate well and, toward the end, was once again telling jokes as he had in the morning. Over dessert, he heard the sound of people in the next room, and asked if they had come for him.",CO188CL12
15471,53,"“No, it’ll be the ladies.”",CO188CL12
15472,54,They got up and went into the drawing room. The “ladies” were five neighbors who came every evening after supper to have coffee with Sinhá Rita and stayed until nightfall.,CO188CL12
15473,55,"Once the pupils had finished their supper, they returned to their lace-making pillows. Sinhá Rita presided over this gaggle of women, some of whom were resident and others not. The whisper of bobbins and the chatter of the ladies were such worldly sounds, so far removed from theology and Latin, that the boy let himself be carried along by them and forgot about everything else.",CO188CL12
15474,56,"At first the ladies were a little shy, but soon recovered. One of them sang a popular ballad accompanied on the guitar by Sinhá Rita, and the evening passed quickly. Before the soirée ended, Sinhá Rita asked Damião to tell them the story she had particularly liked. The same one that had made Lucrécia laugh.",CO188CL12
15475,57,"“Come on, Senhor Damião, don’t play hard to get. Our guests are just about to leave. You’ll really love this one, ladies.”",CO188CL12
15476,58,"Damião had no option but to obey. Despite the expectation created by Sinhá Rita’s words—which rather diminished the joke and its effect—the story did nevertheless make the ladies laugh. Pleased with himself, Damião glanced over at Lucrécia to see if she had laughed as well, but she had her head bent over her work, intent now on finishing her task. She certainly wasn’t laughing, or perhaps only to herself, in the same way she kept her cough to herself.",CO188CL12
15477,59,"The ladies left, and darkness fell. Damião’s heart also grew blacker with the onset of night. What would be happening at his father’s house? Every few minutes he went over to peer out of the window, but returned each time feeling more discouraged. No sign of his godfather. His father had doubtless sent him packing, then summoned a couple of slaves and gone to the police station to demand that a constable come with him to arrest his son and take him back to the seminary.",CO188CL12
15478,60,"Damião asked Sinhá Rita if there was a back entrance to the house and ran out into the garden to see if he could climb over the wall. He also asked if there was an escape route down Rua da Vala or if she could perhaps speak to one of her neighbors, who might be kind enough to take him in. The problem was his cassock: could Sinhá Rita lend him a jacket or an old overcoat? Sinhá Rita did indeed have a jacket, left behind by João Carneiro, either as a souvenir or out of sheer absentmindedness.",CO188CL12
15479,61,"“I have an old jacket of my husband’s,” she said, laughing, “but why are you so frightened? It will all work out, don’t you worry.”",CO188CL12
15480,62,"At last, when night had fallen, a slave arrived bearing a letter for Sinhá Rita from his godfather. No agreement had yet been reached; the father had reacted furiously and tried to smash everything in the room; he had roared out his disapproval, saying that if his lazy rapscallion of a son refused to go back to the seminary, he would have him thrown in jail or sent to the prison ship.",CO188CL12
15481,63,"João Carneiro had battled very hard to persuade Damião’s father not to rush into a decision, but to sleep on it and ponder deeply whether it was right to give the Church such a rebellious, immoral child. He explained in the letter that he had only used such language as a way of winning the argument. Not that he considered the argument won, by any means, but tomorrow he would go and see the man again and try to win him around. He concluded by saying that, meanwhile, the boy could stay at his house.",CO188CL12
15482,64,"Damião finished reading the letter and looked at Sinhá Rita. She’s my last hope, he thought. Sinhá Rita ordered a bottle of ink to be brought, and she wrote this response on the bottom half of João Carneiro’s letter: “My dear Joãozinho, either you save the boy or you’ll never see me again.” She sealed the letter with glue and gave it to the slave for him to deliver with all speed. She again tried to cheer up the reluctant seminarian, who had again donned the monkish hood of humility and consternation. She told him not to worry, that she would sort things out.",CO188CL12
15483,65,“They’ll see what I’m made of! No one’s going to get the better of me!”,CO188CL12
15484,66,"It was time to collect in the lace work. Sinhá Rita examined each piece, and all the girls had completed their daily task. Only Lucrécia was still at her lace-making pillow, furiously working the bobbins, even though it was too dark to see. Sinhá Rita went over to her, saw that the work was unfinished, and flew into a rage, seizing her by one ear.",CO188CL12
15485,67,“You lazy girl!”,CO188CL12

15487,69,“You idler! Our Lady doesn’t protect good-for-nothings like you!”,CO188CL12
15488,70,Lucrécia broke away and fled the room. Sinhá Rita went after her and caught her by the arm.,CO188CL12

15490,72,"“Please, senhora, please forgive me!”",CO188CL12
15491,73,"“No, I won’t forgive you!”",CO188CL12
15492,74,"And they came back into the room: Lucrécia dragged along by her ear, struggling and crying and pleading; and Sinhá Rita declaring that she must be punished.",CO188CL12
15493,75,“Where’s that cane?”,CO188CL12
15494,76,"The cane was next to the sofa. From the other side of the room, Sinhá Rita, not wanting to let the girl go, shouted to Damião.",CO188CL12
15495,77,"“Senhor Damião, give me that cane, will you?”",CO188CL12
15496,78,"Damião froze. Oh, cruel moment! A kind of cloud passed before his eyes. Had he not sworn to help the young girl, who had only fallen behind with her work because of him?",CO188CL12
15497,79,"“Give me the cane, Senhor Damião!”",CO188CL12
15498,80,"Damião began to walk over to the sofa. The young black girl begged him by all that he held most sacred, his mother, his father, Our Lord . . .",CO188CL12
15499,81,"“Help me, sir!",CO188CL12
15500,82,"Sinhá Rita, face aflame, eyes bulging, was demanding the cane, still not letting go of the girl, who was now convulsed by a coughing fit. Damião was terribly touched by her plight, but . . . he had to get out of that seminary. He went over to the sofa, picked up the cane, and handed it to Sinhá Rita.",CO188CL12

15502,2,"Damião ran away from the seminary at eleven in the morning one Friday in August. I don’t know what year it was; before 1850, anyhow. A few minutes later he stopped in confusion; he hadn’t bargained on the effect on passers-by of a shocked runaway seminarian in a cassock. He wasn’t familiar with the streets, and kept losing his way and retracing his steps; finally he stopped. Where was he to go?",CO188CL04
15503,3,"Not home; his father was there, and he’d send him back to the seminary after a good hiding. He’d not fixed on where he’d go, because he’d planned the escape for later; a chance event had brought it forward. Where could he go? He remembered his godfather, João Carneiro, but his godfather was a gutless lazybones, who’d do nothing unless he was pushed to it. It was he who’d taken him to the seminary and introduced him to the rector:",CO188CL04
15504,4,"‘Here he is; here’s the great man of the future,’ he said to the rector.",CO188CL04
15505,5,"‘Come in,’ the rector replied, ‘let the great man come in, so long as he’s humble and good. True greatness is modest. My lad …’",CO188CL04
15506,6,"That was when he got there. A little time later he ran away from the seminary. Here he is now, in the street, scared, uncertain, unsure where to go for safe haven or for advice; he searched his memory for the houses of relatives and friends, without settling on any. Suddenly, he exclaimed:",CO188CL04
15507,7,‘I’ll take refuge with Sinhá Rita! She’ll call my godfather over and tell him she wants me out of the seminary … Maybe that way …’,CO188CL04
15508,8,"Sinhá Rita was a widow, João Carneiro’s mistress; Damião had some inkling of this situation and thought of using it for his own ends. Where did she live? He was so dazed that it was only a few minutes later that it came to mind; it was in the Largo do Capim.",CO188CL04
15509,9,"‘Holy name of Jesus! What’s this?’ shouted Sinhá Rita, sitting up on the settee where she was reclining.",CO188CL04
15510,10,"Damião had just entered in terror; at the very moment he got to the house he’d seen a priest go by, and shoved the door open – luckily it wasn’t locked or bolted. Once inside, he peeped through the shutters, looking for the priest. He hadn’t noticed him, and went on his way.",CO188CL04
15511,11,"‘What’s this, young Senhor Damião?’ shouted the lady of the house, again, for she’d only just recognised him. ‘What are you doing here?’",CO188CL04
15512,12,"Damião, trembling, almost unable to speak, told her not to be afraid, it was nothing; he’d explain everything.",CO188CL04
15513,13,"‘Calm down, and explain yourself.’",CO188CL04
15514,14,"‘I’ll tell you now; I’ve not committed a crime, I swear; but wait a moment.’",CO188CL04
15515,15,"Sinhá Rita looked at him in shock, and all the girls, both those belonging to the house and those from outside, who were sitting around the room in front of their lace-making cushions, stopped their hands and their bobbins. Sinhá Rita lived mostly from teaching lace-making, appliqué and embroidery. While the lad was catching his breath, she ordered the girls to go on working, and waited. In the end, Damião told her everything, his loathing of the seminary; he was certain he wouldn’t make a good priest; he spoke with passion, and asked her to save him.",CO188CL04
15516,16,‘What do you mean? There’s nothing I can do.’,CO188CL04
15517,17,"‘You can, if you want.’",CO188CL04
15518,18,"‘No,’ she replied, shaking her head; ‘I’m not getting involved in your family’s business; I hardly know them; and then there’s your father – they say he’s got a temper on him!’",CO188CL04
15519,19,Damião thought he was lost. He kneeled at her feet and kissed her hands in despair.,CO188CL04
15520,20,"‘There’s a lot you can do, Sinhá Rita; for the love of God, by whatever’s most sacred to you, by your husband’s soul, save me from death, because I’ll kill myself if I have to go back to that place.’",CO188CL04
15521,21,"Sinhá Rita, flattered by the lad’s pleas, tried to persuade him to change his attitude. A priest’s life was holy and beautiful, she told him; time would show him that it was better to get over his aversion, and one day …",CO188CL04
15522,22,"No, never, never, Damião answered, shaking his head and kissing her hands; and again he said it would kill him. Sinhá Rita hesitated for a long while; finally she asked him why he didn’t go and see his godfather.",CO188CL04
15523,23,"‘My godfather? He’s worse than Papa; he won’t listen to me, I don’t think he’d listen to anyone …’",CO188CL04
15524,24,"‘Oh no?’ Sinhá Rita interrupted, hit where it hurts. ‘I’ll show you if he’ll listen or not …’",CO188CL04
15525,25,"She called a slave-boy and ordered him to go to Senhor João Carneiro’s house and call him over on the instant; and if he wasn’t at home, he should ask where he could be found, and run to tell him she needed to talk to him straight away.",CO188CL04
15526,26,"‘Go on, boy.’",CO188CL04
15527,27,"Damião sighed heavily, out loud. To cover up the imperious way she’d given those orders, she explained to the boy that Senhor João Carneiro had been her late husband’s friend and had got her some orphan girls to teach. Later, as he still looked down in the mouth, leaning in a doorway, she laughingly pinched his nose:",CO188CL04
15528,28,"‘Come on, my young priest, relax, everything’ll work out.’",CO188CL04
15529,29,"Sinhá Rita was forty on her birth certificate, and twenty-seven in her eyes. She was a handsome woman, lively, jolly, fond of a good laugh; but when it suited her as fearsome as the devil himself. She decided to cheer the boy up, and in spite of the situation it was no great effort. In a short while, both of them were laughing; she told him stories, and asked him to tell her others, which he did with great aplomb.",CO188CL04
15530,30,"One of these, a silly story accompanied by comic gestures, made one of Sinhá Rita’s girls laugh; she’d forgotten her work to look at the lad, and listen to him. Sinhá Rita picked up a cane at the side of the settee, and threatened her:",CO188CL04
15531,31,"‘Lucretia, mind the cane!’",CO188CL04
15532,32,"The young girl lowered her head to avoid the blow, but the blow didn’t come. It was a warning; if when night fell the task wasn’t done, Lucretia would get the usual punishment. Damião looked at the orphan: she was a black girl, skinny, a little waif with a scar on her forehead and a burn on her left hand.",CO188CL04
15533,33,"She was eleven years of age. Damião noticed she was coughing, but inwardly and muffled, so as not to interrupt the conversation. He felt sorry for her and decided to take her under his wing if she didn’t finish her task. Sinhá Rita wouldn’t refuse her forgiveness … What was more, she’d laughed because she thought him comical; it was his fault, if you call being funny a fault.",CO188CL04
15534,34,"At this point, João Carneiro arrived. He went pale when he saw his godson there, and looked at Sinhá Rita, who wasted no time on preambles. She said it was necessary to take the boy out of the seminary, since he had no vocation for the ecclesiastical life, and one priest less was better than a bad priest.",CO188CL04
15535,35,"We can love and serve the Lord in the wider world. João Carneiro, dismayed, couldn’t find words to reply for the first few minutes; finally, he opened his mouth and admonished his godson for coming to bother ‘strangers’; then he asserted he would punish him.",CO188CL04
15536,36,"‘Punish him – certainly not!’ Sinhá Rita interrupted. ‘What for? Go on, go and talk to his father.’",CO188CL04
15537,37,"‘I can’t guarantee a thing, I don’t think it can be done …’",CO188CL04
15538,38,"‘It is possible, I’ll warrant for that. If you will it,’ she went on in an insinuating tone of voice, ‘everything can be worked out. Go and insist, he’ll give way. Go on, Senhor Carneiro, your godson’s not going back to the seminary; I’m telling you he’s not going …’",CO188CL04
15539,39,"‘But, madam …’",CO188CL04
15540,40,"‘Go on, go.’",CO188CL04
15541,41,"João Carneiro couldn’t work up the courage to go, nor could he stay. He was being pulled in opposite directions. He didn’t care if the boy ended up a priest, a lawyer or a doctor, whatever – a layabout would do; the worst thing was that they were entrusting to him a tremendous struggle with the boy’s father’s deepest feelings, with no certainty as to the outcome; as well as, if the answer was no, another struggle with Sinhá Rita, whose final word had been a threat: ‘I’m telling you he’s not going back …’",CO188CL04
15542,42,"One way or another there was going to be trouble. There was panic in João Carneiro’s eyes, his lids trembled, his chest heaved. He looked at Sinhá Rita in supplication, and with the slightest tinge of reproof. Why couldn’t she ask something else of him? Why didn’t she ask him to walk, in the rain, all the way to Tijuca or Jacarepaguá?",CO188CL04
15543,43,"But to ask him to persuade his dear friend to change his son’s career … He knew the old man; he was quite capable of smashing a jug in his face. Oh! If only the lad could drop down dead, on the spot, in an apoplexy! That was one solution – cruel, it’s true, but definitive.",CO188CL04
15544,44,‘Well?’ Sinhá Rita insisted.,CO188CL04
15545,45,"With a gesture of his hand, he told her to wait. He rubbed his chin, looking for a way out. God in heaven! A decree from the Pope dissolving the church, or at least abolishing seminaries, would bring everything to a satisfactory conclusion.",CO188CL04
15546,46,"João Carneiro would go back home and play gin rummy. Imagine Napoleon’s barber being put in command of the army at the battle of Austerlitz … But the church was still there, seminaries were still there, his godson was still there, his back to the wall, eyes downcast, waiting, and giving no sign of apoplexy.",CO188CL04
15547,47,"‘Go on, go,’ said Sinhá Rita, handing him his hat and stick.",CO188CL04
15548,48,"There was nothing for it. The barber put his razor in its sheath, gripped his sword and went off to the wars. Damião breathed easier; on the outside, however, he remained the same, his eyes fixed on the ground, dejected. This time Sinhá Rita held his chin up.",CO188CL04

15552,52,"In spite of Sinhá Rita’s jovial nature, and his own easygoing ways, Damião wasn’t as happy at supper as earlier that day. He didn’t trust his godfather’s pliable nature. However, he ate well; and towards the end of the meal returned to the funny stories they’d been telling in the morning. When he was eating his dessert, he heard the noise of people in the next room, and asked if they were coming to take him away.",CO188CL04
15553,53,‘It must be the girls.’,CO188CL04

15555,55,"The pupils, when their supper was over, went back to their work cushions. Sinhá Rita presided over all these womenfolk, those who lived there and those from outside. The gentle clicking of the bobbins and the neighbours’ chatter were such homely noises, so far away from theology and Latin, that the lad let himself be drawn in by them and forgot everything else.",CO188CL04
15556,56,"For the first few minutes, the women were a little shy; but that soon wore off. One of them sang a modinha, accompanied by Sinhá Rita on the guitar, and the afternoon passed quickly by. Before the end, Sinhá Rita asked Damião to tell a certain story she’d been amused by. It was the same one that had made Lucretia laugh.",CO188CL04

15558,58,"Damião had no option but to obey. Even though the expectations had been built up, which reduced the surprise and the effect, the story ended in laughter from the girls. Damião, pleased with himself, didn’t forget Lucretia and looked at her, to see if she’d laughed too. He saw she had her face close to her cushion to finish her task. She wasn’t laughing; or maybe she’d laughed inwardly, just as she coughed.",CO188CL04
15559,59,"The neighbours left, and twilight came. Damião’s soul blackened as night fell. What could be happening? Over and over he went to look through the shutters, and came back more and more disheartened. Not a sign of his godfather. It was plain that his father had told him to shut up, called a couple of slaves and gone to the police to ask for the loan of a constable, and was on his way to take him back to the seminary by force.",CO188CL04
15560,60,"Damião asked Sinhá Rita if you could get out of the house by the back; he ran into the backyard and thought he could jump over the wall. He asked if there was some way of escaping to the Rua da Vala, or if it was better to ask some neighbour to do him the favour of taking him in. The worst thing was his cassock; if Sinhá Rita could get him a jacket, or an old frock-coat… Sinhá Rita had just the thing, a coat, a memento from João Carneiro, or perhaps an over-sight.",CO188CL04
15561,61,"‘I’ve one of my late husband’s coats,’ she said, laughing, ‘but what’s all this fuss for? It’ll all work out, don’t worry.’",CO188CL04
15562,62,"Finally, just as night came, one of his godfather’s slaves appeared with a letter for Sinhá Rita. The business wasn’t settled yet; the father was furious and on the point of smashing the furniture; he’d shouted that no, sir, the young dandy would go to the seminary, or he’d put him in jail, or the army.",CO188CL04
15563,63,"João Carneiro had had a terrific struggle to persuade his friend not to take things in hand now, but sleep on it for the night, and think whether it was right to destine such a rebellious and vicious young man to the religious life. He explained in the letter that he spoke in those terms the better to argue the case. He’d not won it yet, he said; but on the next day he’d go and see him and insist again. He concluded by saying the boy should come to his house.",CO188CL04
15564,64,"Damião finished reading the letter and looked at Sinhá Rita. ‘She’s my last refuge,’ he thought. Sinhá Rita had a horn inkwell brought over, and at the bottom of the letter itself, on the same sheet, wrote this reply: ‘Joãozinho, either you save the boy, or I’ll never see you again.’ She sealed the letter with a wafer, and gave it to the slave, telling him to take it quickly. Again she tried to cheer the seminarian, who had once more donned the habit of humility and dismay. She told him to calm down, for this was now her affair.",CO188CL04

He commissioned a great expert in matters of genealogy, who, in no time at all, had traced his ancestry back to some Roman general from the fourth century, Bernardus Barrelius—a name that gave rise to great controversy, which continues to this day, with some saying that King Bernardão must once have been a barrel-maker, and others that this was all a silly confusion arising from the name of the founder of the family.

There was no shortage of brides for the new king, but none pleased him as much as a beautiful, rich, illustrious young woman called Estrelada.

Bernardão plied her with rare, sumptuous gifts, while her family screamed at her to remember that a crown on the head is worth more than any affair of the heart, urging her not to bring shame on them when the illustrious Bernardão was tempting them with a principality, reminding her that thrones were few and far between, etc., etc. Estrelada, however, resisted these temptations.",CO166CL10

One madrigal was judged to be better than all the others, and it was written by the poet she loved.

A third competition ended in a third victory for the poet.",CO166CL10

No word bore any resemblance to the spoken language; consonants climbed on top of other consonants, vowels dissolved into other vowels, words of two syllables now had seven or eight and vice versa, everything was muddled up and switched around, with no verve, no elegance—a language of fragments and scraps.",CO166CL10

He also declared that there would be one final competition to win the hand of the lovely Estrelada. The jumble in the dictionary was transferred to people’s minds; everyone lived in a state of utter confusion. Jokers would greet each other in the street, using the new phrases; for example, instead of saying: “Good morning, how are you?” they would say: “Pflerrgpxx, rouph, aa?”",CO166CL10

He, however, answered that, first, he would see what he could do. Entrants were given ninety days to compose their poem, and again there were twenty entries. The best of these, despite that barbarous new language, was the one written by the poet.

Every year, it’s the same reunion of family and friends, a bonfire is burning in the yard, the usual potatoes are being roasted, and fortunes are being told. There’s also a dinner, sometimes dancing, and a parlor game or two, all without great ceremony. João Viegas is a clerk in a civil jurisdiction of Rio de Janeiro.",CO166CL08
15746,6,“Let’s get going. Who’s starting?” he said. “It will have to be dona Felismina. We’ll see if someone loves her in secret.”,CO166CL08
15747,7,"Dona Felismina smiled wanly. She was a good woman in her forties, of gifts neither natural nor pecuniary, who lived with an eye out—beneath piously lowered lid—for a husband. In fact, the kidding was harsh, but natural. Dona Felismina was the perfect example of those gentle and indulgent creatures who seem to have been born to make other people laugh. She took the dice and rolled them with an air of unbelieving assent.",CO166CL08
15748,8,"Ten, shouted two voices. Rangel lowered his gaze to the bottom of the page, saw the lines and read them; they said yes, there was somebody, somebody she would meet Sunday at church, when she went to mass. The entire table congratulated dona Felismina, who smiled with a sniff, though inwardly hopeful.",CO166CL08
15749,9,"Others rolled the dice, and Rangel went on reading their fortunes. He read pretentiously. From time to time, he would remove his spectacles and clean them at great leisure on a corner of a batiste handkerchief—either because it was batiste or because it gave off a fine scent of jasmine. He was terrifically conceited, and for that reason he was known as “the diplomat.”",CO166CL08
15750,10,"“Come on, Ambassador, keep going.”",CO166CL08
15751,11,"Rangel shuddered; he had forgotten to read a fortune, absorbed as he was in gazing from one end to the other at the row of young women on the other side of the table. Was he courting one of them? Let’s proceed in order.",CO166CL08
15752,12,"He was single, the result of circumstances, not by vocation. As a youth, he had been involved in a few neighborhood dalliances, but over time the itch of ambition came over him and it was for this reason he remained single until the forty-one years of age at which we are seeing him. He pined for a fiancée superior to him and to the circle he lived in, and he wasted time waiting for her.",CO166CL08
15753,13,"He would even go to balls held by a rich and famous lawyer for whom he copied papers and who favored him greatly. At the balls, he was in the same lowly position as at the office; he would spend the night wandering the halls, peering into the ballroom, watching the ladies go by, devouring a multitude of magnificent shoulders and well-turned figures with his eyes. He envied the men and would imitate them. He would leave ablaze and determined.",CO166CL08
15754,14,"If there were no balls, he would go to religious celebrations, where he could see some of the finest young women of the city. He was a regular in the atrium of the imperial palace, on procession days, to see the grandes dames and the court hangers-on—ministers, general, diplomats, judges—make their entrances, and he was familiar with all and everyone, persons as well as carriages. He would return from celebration and procession as he returned from a ball—worked up, ardent, capable of carrying off the palm of fortune in one blow.",CO166CL08
15755,15,"The worst is that between the hand and the grapes there’s the poet’s wall, and Rangel wasn’t the man to be jumping walls. In his imagination he did everything—he would carry off women and lay cities to waste. More than once, for himself, he was minister of state and he had his fill of courtesies and decrees.",CO166CL08
15756,16,"One day, a second of December, on returning from a parade on the palace square, he went so far as to hail himself emperor; for this, he imagined a revolution in which he spilled a bit of blood, not much, and a benevolent dictatorship in which he took revenge for no more than handful of a scribe’s minor discontents. But here on earth, all of his feats were fairytales. In reality, he was peaceful and discreet.",CO166CL08
15757,17,"At forty, he was disabused of his ambitions, but his temper remained the same, and, his conjugal vocation notwithstanding, he still couldn’t find a bride. More than one would have would have accepted him with great pleasure; he was so circumspect he lost them all. One day, he noticed Joaninha, who was turning nineteen and had pretty and serene eyes, unsullied by all masculine conversation. Rangel had known her since she was a child, had gone with her on his lap to the Passeio Público, or to fireworks displays in Lapa; how to talk to her of love? But on the other hand his ties to the house were such that they could facilitate the marriage for him; and it was either this one or none other.",CO166CL08
15758,18,"This time, the wall wasn’t high, and the grapes were hanging fairly low; to pick them, you would need only make the effort to put out an arm. Rangel had been busy with this task for a few months. He wouldn’t put his arm out without first looking around to see if anybody was coming, and if anybody was he would dissemble and leave.",CO166CL08
15759,19,"When he did manage to put his arm out, a puff of wind would set the bunch of grapes to swaying or a little bird or two would rustle around in the dry leaves, and that was all it took for him to pull his hand back. Time went by that way, and the passion took root, caused him hours of distress, which was always followed by greater hopes. Just now he is bearing his first love letter, ready to deliver it. He had two or three good opportunities earlier, but he is always putting the moment off; the night is so long! In the meantime, he goes on reading fortunes with the solemnity of a soothsayer.",CO166CL08
15760,20,"All around, everything is cheerful. Everyone is whispering or laughing or talking at the same time. Tio Rufino, who is the family wag, is going around the table with a feather, tickling the girls’ ears. João Viegas is anxious about a friend, Calisto, who has been held up. Where could Calisto have gone?",CO166CL08
15761,21,“Out! Out! I need the table; let’s go to the parlor.”,CO166CL08
15762,22,"It was Dona Adelaide coming back; she was going to set the table for dinner. Everyone emigrated, and it was on the way that you could see how lovely the clerk’s daughter was. Rangel followed her with his besotted eyes open wide. She went to the window for a few seconds as a parlor game was being readied, and he went, too; it was the chance to give her the letter.",CO166CL08
15763,23,"Across the way, in a big house, there was a ball, and people were dancing. She looked over; he looked over, too. They saw couples going in step by the windows, the ladies with their silks and laces, the gentlemen, some decorated, slim and elegant. From time to time, a quick, fleeting flash of diamonds as the dancers turned.",CO166CL08
15764,24,"Chatting couples, glittering epaulettes, men’s torsos aslant, movements of fans, all of it in fragments, through windows that couldn’t show the entire ballroom but let you imagine the rest. He was at least familiar with everything, and he told the clerk’s daughter everything. The obsession with grandeur, which had seemed dormant, started playing its tricks on our man’s heart, and here he is trying to win over the heart, too, of another woman.",CO166CL08
15765,25,"“I know a person who would do very well over there,” muttered Rangel.",CO166CL08
15766,26,"And Joaninha, naively:
“It’s you.”",CO166CL08
15767,27,"Rangel, flattered, smiled, and couldn’t think of anything to say. He took a look at the footmen and coachmen, in livery, chatting in clusters or leaning on the hoods of their carriages. He started pointing out carriages: this one is Olinda’s, that one is Maranguape’s, but here comes another one, rolling from the direction of Rua da Lapa, and it’s turning into Rua das Mangueiras. It stops across the way; the footman jumps off, opens the door, doffs his cap, and stands to attention. Out comes a bald head, a man, two decorations, then a lavishly dressed lady; they go into the hall and up the carpeted stairs, adorned at the bottom with two large vases.",CO166CL08
15768,28,“Joaninha! Senhor Rangel!”,CO166CL08
15769,29,"Blasted parlor game! Just when he was coming up in his head with a hint about the couple going up the stairs and was thus going to transition naturally into handing over the letter. . . . Rangel complied, and he took a seat facing the girl. Dona Adelaide, who was directing the game, was collecting the names; each person had to be a flower. Obviously, tio Rufino, always a wag, chose a pumpkin flower for himself. Rangel, for his part, wanting to avoid banality, went over the flowers in his mind, and when the lady of the house asked him his, he responded softly and at leisure:",CO166CL08
15770,30,"“Four o’clock, madam.”",CO166CL08
15771,31,"“The worst is that Calisto isn’t here,” sighed the clerk.",CO166CL08
15772,32,“Did he say he was coming?”,CO166CL08
15773,33,"“He did; just yesterday he dropped by the registry office to let me know he’d be late, but to count on him. He had to go to a party on Rua da Carioca.”",CO166CL08
15774,34,"“Two, please!” resounded a voice from the hall.",CO166CL08
15775,35,"“Oh, great! There’s the man!”",CO166CL08
15776,36,"João Viegas went to open the door; it was Calisto, accompanied by an odd young man he introduced to everybody at the same time:",CO166CL08
15777,37,"“Queirós, an employee at the hospital; he’s not family, even though we really look alike. You see one of us, you see the other. . . .”",CO166CL08
15778,38,"Everybody laughed; Calisto, ugly as sin, whereas Queirós—black hair, black eyes, and singularly slender—was a good-looking young man of twenty-six or twenty-seven, was kidding. The girls shrank slightly; dona Felismina opened all sails.",CO166CL08
15779,39,"“We were at our parlor games. You can join in, too,” said the lady of the house. “Are you playing, senhor Queirós?”",CO166CL08
15780,40,"Queirós replied that he was and proceeded to look the other people over. He knew some, and he exchanged two or three words with them. He told João Viegas that he had been wanting to meet him for a long time, on account of a favor, judicial business, his father had once owed him. João Viegas remembered nothing, not even after he told him what it was, but he was glad to hear the news in public—he looked at everyone, and for a few minutes he reveled in silence.",CO166CL08
15781,41,"Queirós plunged into the game. Half an hour later, he was very nearly one of the family. He was all action, spoke unselfconsciously, gestured naturally and spontaneously. He had a large repertoire of punishments for the game being played, something that delighted the entire company, and nobody handled them better, with such movement and liveliness, going from one side to the other, getting the groups together, rearranging chairs, talking to the girls as if they had been childhood playmates.",CO166CL08
15782,42,"“Dona Joaninha here, in this chair; dona Cesária, over there, standing up, and senhor Camilo comes in through that door. . . . No, not that way: this way, so. . . .”",CO166CL08
15783,43,"Rangel, rigid in a chair, was speechless. Where was this whirlwind coming from? And the whirlwind went on blowing; the men were getting their hats snatched and the girls their hair tousled, but they were laughing with joy: Queirós here, Queirós there, Queirós everywhere. Rangel went from speechlessness to humiliation. The scepter was falling from his hands. He didn’t look at the other fellow, he didn’t laugh at what he said, and he answered him curtly.",CO166CL08
15784,44,"Inwardly, he was irritated and was telling him to go to hell, calling him a happy idiot who was making people laugh and delighting them because on holiday evenings everything is merriment. But as these things and worse occurred again and again, he was unable to recover his ease of mind. He was really suffering, to the very core of his being; and the worst thing is that the other fellow noticed this distress, and worse still is that he himself noticed it was noticed.",CO166CL08
15785,45,"Rangel fantasized of settling scores just as he did of blessings. In his mind, he tore Queirós apart; he then pondered the possibility of a random misfortune, an ache, for instance, but a terrible one, that would get that intruder out of there. No ache, nothing; the devil looked ever jollier, and the entire room was fascinated by him. Even Joaninha, so timid, was electrified in Queirós hands, as were the other young women; everybody, men as well as women, seemed to be striving to attend to him. Since he had mentioned dancing, the girls went to talk to tio Rufino, and they asked him to play a quadrille on the flute, just one, all they were asking.",CO166CL08
15786,46,"“I can’t, a callus is bothering me.”",CO166CL08
15787,47,"“The flute?” shouted Calisto. “Let’s ask Queirós to play us something, and then you’ll see what the flute can be. . . . Go get the flute, Rufino. Let’s listen to Queirós. You won’t believe how wistful he is on the flute.”",CO166CL08
15788,48,"Queirós played Casta diva.[1] How ridiculous! Rangel said to himself, a song even kids whistle in the street. He took a sidelong glance at him to see if a serious man could really act that way, and he concluded that the flute was a grotesque instrument. He looked at Joaninha, too, and he saw that, like everybody else, she, absorbed, in thrall to the beat of the music, was fixated on Queirós, and he shuddered, though he knew not why.",CO166CL08
15789,49,"The other faces revealed expressions the same as hers, and yet he sensed something that complicated his aversion to the intruder. When the flute went silent, Joaninha clapped, but less than the others, and Rangel wondered if it was the usual timidity or if it was a particular feeling. . . . He couldn’t delay giving her the letter any longer.",CO166CL08
15790,50,"Dinner came. Everybody went into the dining room with undue confusion, and fortunately for Rangel he got to sit in front of Joaninha, whose eyes were more beautiful than ever and so expressive they looked altogether unusual. Rangel savored them in silence, and he rebuilt the entire dream of his that that devil Queirós had leveled with a flick of the finger.",CO166CL08
15791,51,"So again he saw himself by her side, in the house he was going to rent, a love nest he adorned with the gilt of his imagination. He even won a lottery prize and used it all on silks and jewels for his wife, the lovely Joaninha—Joaninha Rangel, dona Joaninha Rangel, dona Joana Viegas Rangel, or dona Joana Cândida Viegas Rangel. . . . He couldn’t leave out the Cândida. . . .",CO166CL08
15792,52,"“Come on, a toast, Ambassador. . . . Say one of those toasts. . . .”",CO166CL08
15793,53,"Rangel assented; the entire table was repeating tio Rufino’s idea. Joaninha herself was asking him for a toast like the one of the year before. Rangel replied that he was going to comply; he just wanted to finish that chicken wing. Agitation, whispered accolades; dona Adelaide, when a young woman told her she’d never heard Rangel speak:",CO166CL08
15794,54,"“No?” she asked in amazement. “You won’t believe it. He’s an excellent speaker, very clear, measured words, and fine manners. . . .”",CO166CL08
15795,55,"As he ate, he mulled over a recollection or two, snippets of ideas he could use to put together phrases and metaphors. He finished and stood up. He looked smug and full of himself. At last, there was a knocking on his door. The shreds of anecdotes, of cruel jokes, had come to an end, and people came to him for something decent and serious. He looked around, saw all eyes raised, waiting. Not all; Joaninha’s were turned Queirós’s way, and his, in a cavalcade of promises, went to meet them halfway. Rangel blanched. His words caught in his throat; but he had to speak, people were waiting for him, with interest, in silence.",CO166CL08
15796,56,"He complied badly. It was, as it turns out, a toast to the master of the house and his daughter. He called her a marvel of God, conveyed from immortality to reality, a phrase that he had used three years before and that was probably forgotten. He spoke, too, of the sanctuary of the family, of the sacred place of friendship, and of gratitude, the finest fruit of pure hearts. Where there was no meaning, his speech was more ostentatious and emphatic. In all a toast of a good ten minutes that he dispatched in five and then took a seat.",CO166CL08
15797,57,"It wasn’t all. Queirós stood up just two or three minutes later, and the silence was even more sudden and complete. Joaninha looked down, discomposed by what he was going to say; Rangel quaked.",CO166CL08
15798,58,"“The honorable friend of this house, senhor Rangel,” said Queirós, “toasted the two people whose saint’s name is today; I toast the person who is the saint of every day, dona Adelaide.”",CO166CL08
15799,59,"This apt remark was given a big hand, and dona Adelaide, flattered, received compliments from each guest. Her daughter didn’t limit herself to compliments.",CO166CL08
15800,60,"“Mother! Mother!” she burst out, getting up; and she went to give her a hug and three or four kisses, a kind of letter to be read by two people.",CO166CL08
15801,61,"Rangel went from anger to dejection, and when dinner was over he thought about leaving, but hope, green-eyed monster, asked him to stay, and he stayed. Who knows? It was all fleeting, a one-night thing, a Saint John’s Eve romance; ultimately, he was a friend of the house and he had the family’s respect. To get the young woman he needed only ask for her. And then that Queirós might not have the means to marry. What did he do at the hospital?",CO166CL08
15802,62,"Maybe something unworthy. . . . At that, he took a sidelong glance at Queirós’s clothes, threaded his way into him through the seams, examined the light embroidery of his shirt, eyed the knees of his trousers, not to mention his shoes, to see how worn they were, and he concluded that he was a flighty young man, yet probably spent everything on himself, and getting married was serious business. He might also have a widowed mother, unmarried sisters. . . . Rangel was alone.",CO166CL08
15803,63,"“Tio Rufino, play a quadrille.”",CO166CL08
15804,64,“I can’t. Playing the flute after eating makes you sick to your stomach. Let’s play bingo.”,CO166CL08
15805,65,Rangel said he couldn’t play—he had a headache—but Joaninha went over to him and asked him to be her partner.,CO166CL08
15806,66,"“Half for you and half for me,” she said, smiling; he smiled, too, and assented.",CO166CL08
15807,67,"They sat next to each other. Joaninha was talking to him, laughing, looking up at him with her lovely eyes, restive, moving her head in all directions. Rangel felt better, and before long he felt altogether good. He was playing haphazardly, forgetting a few numbers, which she indicated with a finger—a nymph’s finger, he said to himself; and he started slipping up on purpose to see the girl’s finger and hear her complain:",CO166CL08
15808,68,"“You’re very forgetful. Watch out, we’re going to lose our money this way. . . .”",CO166CL08
15809,69,"Rangel thought about giving her the letter under the table, but since they were not professed admirers it would have been only natural for her to take it with astonishment and ruin everything; he had to let her know. He looked around the table: all faces were bent over the cards, closely following the numbers. At that point, he leaned to the right and glanced down at Joaninha’s cards, as if to check something.",CO166CL08
15810,70,"“You already have two squares,” he whispered.",CO166CL08

15815,75,“What do you mean two? That’s four.”,CO166CL08
15816,76,"There were four; leaning over, nearly brushing his ear with her lips, she pointed them out. Then, laughing and shaking her head, she looked at him:",CO166CL08
15817,77,"“You, sir! You!”",CO166CL08
15818,78,"Rangel heard this with singular delight; her voice was so sweet, and her expression so friendly, that he forgot everything, took her by the waist, and launched into the eternal waltz of fantasies with her. House, table, guests—everything, like the futile work of the imagination, disappeared, to leave only the single reality, the two of them, turning in space beneath a million stars, shining precisely to illuminate them.",CO166CL08
15819,79,"No letter, no nothing. Early in the morning everyone went to the window to see the guests from the ball across the way leaving. Rangel recoiled in fright. He saw Queirós and the lovely Joaninha squeeze each other’s fingers. He tried to account for it—they were just illusions, but no sooner was one destroyed than it was followed by more and more, in the way of never-ending waves. It was hard for him to understand that one night only, a few hours, should have been enough to connect two individuals that way; but the truth was loud and clear from the manners of both, from their eyes, from their words, from their laughter, and even from the yearning with which they took leave of each other in the morning.",CO166CL08
15820,80,"He left stunned. One night only, hardly more than a few hours! At his house, to which he arrived late, he lay down in bed, not to go to sleep, but to break into sobs. Alone with himself, the veneer of affectation left him, and he was no longer the diplomat—he was the possessed man twisting and turning in bed, shouting, crying like a child, truly miserable over that joyless autumn love. The poor devil, made of day-dreams, indolence, and affectation, was, in substance, as wretched as Othello, and he went through a crueler dénouement.",CO166CL08

This same party takes place every year, with relatives and friends; there’s a bonfire in the garden, they roast potatoes as usual, and tell fortunes.

Rangel had known her since she was a child, had carried her in his arms to the Passeio Publico2 or to see the fireworks at Lapa; how could he speak to her of love? But, on the other hand, he was so well accepted in the household that it would ease his way to marriage; anyway, it was this or nothing.",CO166CL04
15840,18,"This time the wall wasn’t high, and the fruit hung low; all he needed to do was stretch his arm out with a bit of effort, and pick it from the branch. For some months, Rangel had been engaged in this enterprise. He wouldn’t stretch his arm out without looking all around to see if anyone was coming, and, if there was, he pretended nothing was happening and went on his way.",CO166CL04
15841,19,"When he did stretch it out, a gust of wind moved the branch, or a bird rustled in the fallen leaves, and that was all it took to make him withdraw his hand. Time went by and this passion got into his system, bringing with it many hours of anguish, always followed by greater hopes. At this very moment, he’s brought his first love letter with him, and is ready to hand it over. He’s already had two or three good opportunities, but still he puts it off; there’s a long night ahead! Meanwhile, he continues reading out the fortunes, solemn as a high priest.",CO166CL04
15842,20,"There’s happiness all around. They whisper, laughing and talking at the same time. Uncle Rufino, who’s the family joker, goes round the table with a feather, tickling the girls behind the ears. João Viegas is anxiously awaiting Calisto, a friend who’s late. Where can Calisto have got to?",CO166CL04
15843,21,‘Out of the way! I need the table; let’s go into the drawing room.’,CO166CL04
15844,22,"Dona Adelaide was back; they were going to lay the table for dinner. Everyone moved away and, as she walked, you could see how delightful the notary’s daughter was. Rangel followed her, his eyes wide with passion. She went to the window for a few moments, while a game of forfeits was being set up, and he went too; it was an opportunity to slip her the letter.",CO166CL04
15845,23,"On the other side of the street, in a grand house, there was a ball, and people were dancing. She was looking, and he looked too. In the windows they could see the partners pass, swaying to the rhythm, the ladies with their silks and lace, the gentlemen refined and elegant, some with medals on their chests. From time to time, there was a flash of diamonds, swift and fleeting, in the whirl of the dance.",CO166CL04
15846,24,"Couples talking, gleaming epaulettes, the men leaning towards the women, fluttering fans, all this in brief glimpses through the windows, which didn’t reveal the whole of the ballroom; but the rest could be imagined. He, at least, knew it all, and conveyed it all to the notary’s daughter. The obsession with rank, which had seemed dormant, began to perform cartwheels in our friend’s heart, and here he was trying to seduce the girl’s heart too.",CO166CL04
15847,25,"‘I know someone who’d be in their element in there,’ murmured Rangel.",CO166CL04
15848,26,"‘You,’ said Joaninha, naïvely.",CO166CL04
15849,27,"Rangel smiled, flattered, and could find nothing to say. He looked at the lackeys and the coachmen in livery in the street, chatting in groups or leaning over the roofs of the coaches. He began to point some of them out: this is Olinda’s, that’s Maranguape; but another wheels in from the Rua da Lapa into the Rua das Mangueiras. It stops opposite; the lackey jumps down, opens the carriage door, takes his hat off and stands to attention. There comes out a bald pate, a head, a man, a couple of medals, then a richly dressed lady; they go into the foyer, and up the stairs, carpeted and flanked at the bottom by two large vases.",CO166CL04
15850,28,"‘Joaninha, Senhor Rangel …’",CO166CL04
15851,29,"Damn the game of forfeits! Just as he was putting a suggestive phrase together in his head about the couple going up the stairs, intending to pass naturally on to handing over the letter … Rangel obeyed, and sat down opposite the girl. Dona Adelaide, who was presiding over the game of forfeits, was collecting names; each person was to take the name of a flower. Uncle Rufino, of course, always the clown, chose the pumpkin flower. As for Rangel – trying to avoid being common, he mentally compared flowers, and when the lady of the house asked him for his, he answered, gently and slowly:",CO166CL04

15857,35,‘Thank goodness for that! Here he comes!’,CO166CL04
15858,36,"João Viegas went to open the door; it was Calisto, accompanied by an unknown young man, whom he introduced to everybody in general:",CO166CL04

15860,38,"Everyone laughed; it was Calisto’s joke, for he was ugly as sin – whereas Queiroz was a handsome lad of twenty-six or twenty-seven, with black hair, black eyes, and extraordinarily slim. The girls drew back a little; Dona Felismina put on full sail.",CO166CL04
15861,39,"‘We were playing forfeits; d’you want to join in?’ said the lady of the house. ‘Will you play, Senhor Queiroz?’",CO166CL04
15862,40,"Queiroz said he would and started to survey the other guests. He knew some, and exchanged two or three words with them. He told João Viegas that he’d wanted to meet him for a long time, because of a favour he’d done his father a while back, in a court case. João Viegas didn’t remember a thing about it, even after he told him what the favour was; but he was pleased to hear of it, and in public too; he looked round at everyone, and took a few minutes for silent gratification.",CO166CL04
15863,41,"Queiroz entered the game with a will. After half an hour, he was at home. He was lively and voluble; his manners were spontaneous and natural. He had a huge repertory of penalties for the game of forfeits, which delighted everyone, and no one could impose them better. He was so vivacious and animated, going hither and thither, putting groups together, moving chairs, talking to the girls as if he’d been their playmate when they were children.",CO166CL04
15864,42,"‘Dona Joaninha here, in this chair; Dona Cesária, over here, standing, and Senhor Camilo comes in by that door … No, no: look, like this, so as to …’",CO166CL04
15865,43,"Stiff in his chair, Rangel was dumbfounded. Where had this hurricane come from? And on the hurricane went, lifting the hats off the men and shaking the girls’ hair loose, as they laughed happily: Queiroz here, Queiroz there, Queiroz everywhere. Rangel was stupefied, then mortified. His sceptre was falling from his hands. He didn’t look at the intruder, laughed at nothing he said, and answered him curtly.",CO166CL04
15866,44,"Inside, he was riddled with envy, wished him to the devil, called him a halfwit, good for amusing people and making them laugh – that’s parties for you. But, as he repeated these things and worse, he couldn’t get back his peace of mind. He was really suffering, in the heart of his self-esteem; worse, Queiroz could see all this agitation, and worst of all, Rangel saw that he was seen.",CO166CL04
15867,45,"Just as he dreamed of glory, so Rangel imagined revenge. In his head, he smashed Queiroz to smithereens; then he thought of some disaster or other, an ache would do, but something really painful that would remove the intruder from the scene. But nothing happened; the devil was more and more sprightly, and the whole room was spellbound, fascinated. Even Joaninha, timid as she was, came to life in Queiroz’s hands, as did the other girls; everyone, men and women, seemed eager to obey him. He mentioned dancing, and the girls went over to Uncle Rufino, to ask him to play a quadrille on the flute – just one, that was all they wanted.",CO166CL04
15868,46,"‘I can’t, I’ve got a corn.’",CO166CL04
15869,47,"‘Flute?’ shouted Calisto. ‘Ask Queiroz to play something for us, and you’ll see what flute-playing is … Go and get the flute, Rufino. Listen to Queiroz. You’ve no idea how tenderly he plays!’",CO166CL04
15870,48,"Queiroz played ‘Casta Diva’. How ridiculous! Rangel said to himself – a tune even the kids in the street can whistle. He looked at him askance, asking himself if a serious person would be seen dead doing that; and came to the conclusion that the flute was a grotesque instrument. He looked at Joaninha too, and saw that, like everyone else, she was watching Queiroz, enthralled, enamoured of the sound of the music, and he shuddered, uncertain why.",CO166CL04
15871,49,"The other faces had the same expression, but even so, he felt something which complicated his aversion for the intruder. When the flute finished, Joaninha applauded less than the others, and Rangel began to wonder if it was her usual shyness, or if something else was affecting her … He must give her the letter without delay.",CO166CL04
15872,50,"Dinner was served. Everyone went into the dining room, and happily for Rangel, he was placed opposite Joaninha, whose eyes were more beautiful than ever, and so liquid they looked changed. Rangel savoured them in silence, and reconstructed the entire dream that Queiroz had demolished with a flick of his fingers.",CO166CL04
15873,51,"Thus it was that he saw himself by her side, in the house he’d rent – a love-nest he gilded with his imagination. He even won a lottery prize and spent it all on silks and jewels for his wife, lovely Joaninha – Joaninha Rangel – Dona Joaninha Rangel – Dona Joana Viegas Rangel – or Dona Joana Cândida Viegas Rangel … He couldn’t leave the Cândida out …",CO166CL04
15874,52,"‘Come on, Mr Diplomat; give us one of those toasts of yours …’",CO166CL04
15875,53,"Rangel woke up; the whole table was seconding Uncle Rufino’s suggestion; Joaninha herself was asking him to propose a toast, like last year’s. Rangel said he would obey; he was just finishing this chicken wing. Nudges, winks and flattering whispers; Dona Adelaide, when a girl said she’d never heard Rangel speak:",CO166CL04
15876,54,"‘Haven’t you?’ she asked in astonishment. ‘You’ve no idea; he speaks so well, very clearly, such well-chosen words, and so beautifully expressed …’",CO166CL04
15877,55,"As he was eating, he summoned up some memories, shreds of ideas, for use in putting his sentences and metaphors together. He finished and got to his feet. He looked happy and full of himself. At last, they were knocking at his door. The round robin of silly stories and empty jokes was over, and they’d come to him to hear something correct and serious. He looked around, and saw all eyes lifted up in expectation. Not all; Joaninha’s sloped off in Queiroz’s direction, and his came to meet hers halfway, in a regular cavalcade of promises. Rangel went pale. The words died in his mouth, but he had to speak; they were waiting for him, in approving silence.",CO166CL04
15878,56,"He didn’t come up to expectations. It was just a toast to the host and his daughter. He called her one of God’s thoughts, borne from the immortal realms into reality, a phrase he’d used three years ago, but which should have been forgotten by now. He also mentioned the sanctuary of the family, the altar of friendship, and of gratitude, which is the flower of pure hearts. The more nonsensical the words, the more grandiose and resonant they were. All in all, a toast that should have lasted a good ten minutes he disposed of in five, and sat down.",CO166CL04
15879,57,"Nor was that all. Queiroz soon got up, two or three minutes later, for another toast, and the silence was even more sudden and complete. Joaninha stared into her lap, embarrassed by what he might say; Rangel shivered.",CO166CL04
15880,58,"‘The illustrious friend of this house, Senhor Rangel,’ said Queiroz, ‘drank the health of the two people who share the name of the saint whose day we are celebrating; I drink to the one who is a saint every day, to Dona Adelaide.’",CO166CL04
15881,59,"Great applause greeted this compliment, and Dona Adelaide, flattered, was congratulated by each and every guest. Her daughter didn’t stop there.",CO166CL04
15882,60,"‘Mama! Mama!’ she exclaimed, getting up. She went to embrace her and kiss her three or four times; a sort of letter to be read by two people.",CO166CL04
15883,61,"Rangel went from anger to despondency, and when the dinner was over he thought of leaving. But hope, a devil with green eyes, begged him to stay, and he stayed. Who knows? It was all a passing whim, one night only, a flirtation for St John’s Night; he, after all, was a friend of the family, and was esteemed by them; he only needed to ask for the girl’s hand, and he’d be given it. And anyway, Queiroz might not have the means to marry. What did he do at the Santa Casa?",CO166CL04
15884,62,"Maybe it was some inferior job … At this, he looked sideways at Queiroz’s clothes, carefully inspected his seams, scrutinised the embroidery on his shirt, examined his trouser knees to see if they were worn, and his shoes, and concluded that he took pains with the way he dressed, but probably spent everything on himself – marriage, however, is a serious matter. Maybe he had a widowed mother, unmarried sisters … Rangel lived on his own.",CO166CL04

15888,66,"‘Half the winnings for you, half for me,’ she said smiling; he smiled too and accepted.",CO166CL04
15889,67,"They sat next to one another. Joaninha was talking to him, laughing, lifting her beautiful eyes to him, restless, moving her head to one side and another. Rangel felt better, and in no time he was completely happy. He marked the numbers at random, missing some, which she pointed out with her finger – a nymph-like finger, he said to himself; and he began making mistakes deliberately so as to see her finger, and hear her scolding him:",CO166CL04

15900,78,"Rangel heard this with singular delight; her voice was so sweet, her expression so friendly, that he forgot everything, grabbed her by the waist, and threw himself into an eternal, chimerical waltz. House, table, guests, all disappeared, vain products of the imagination, all of them. Nothing was left but a single reality, the two of them whirling in space under a million stars purposely shining to light up their way.",CO166CL04
15901,79,"No letter, nothing. When morning was near, they all went to the window to see the guests leaving from the ball opposite. Rangel recoiled in horror. He saw Queiroz gently squeeze the lovely Joaninha’s hand. He tried to explain it away, it was just an illusion, but no sooner had he destroyed one than others appeared, like waves breaking over him, one after another. He could barely understand that one single night, a few hours could be enough to join two creatures in this way; but it was the living truth, evident from their gestures, their eyes, their words, their laughter, even from the sadness with which they separated in the early morning.",CO166CL04
15902,80,"He left in a state of shock. A single night, just a few hours! When, some time later, he got home, he lay down on the bed, not to sleep, but to burst out sobbing. When he was alone, all his affectation disappeared, no longer was he the diplomat, he was a maniac rolling around on the bed, shouting, crying like a child, truly unhappy, all because of this sad, autumnal passion. This poor soul, this mixture of daydreaming, indolence and affectation, was, in substance, as unhappy as Othello, and his end was even crueller.",CO166CL04

15909,5,"Rangel was reading from the book of fortunes. He turned the page and read out another question: “Is someone secretly in love with you?” There was general fidgeting; the young ladies and gentlemen smiled at each other. The year was 1854, it was the eve of São João, and we were in a fine house on Rua das Mangueiras. João was also the name of the host, João Viegas, and he had a daughter named after him, Joaninha. Every year, the same group of friends and family gathered, a bonfire was lit in the garden, potatoes were roasted as custom required, and fortunes were told. There would be supper and sometimes dancing or parlor games to follow; it was all very convivial. João Viegas was a clerk at one of the civil courts in Rio.",CO166CL10

It was a rather cruel joke, but understandable. Dona Felismina was the perfect example of those gentle, forgiving creatures who seem to have been born to be the butt of other people’s jokes. She picked up the dice and threw them with a patient but skeptical air.",CO166CL10

The whole table congratulated Dona Felismina, who smiled dismissively, but was secretly rather hopeful.",CO166CL10
15913,9,"Others took the dice, and Rangel proceeded to read each person’s fortune. He read in a pretentious, affected manner. From time to time, he removed his spectacles and wiped them very slowly with the corner of his cambric handkerchief—either simply because it was rather fine cambric or because it gave off a delicate scent of jasmine. His fondness for such airs and graces had merited him the nickname “Mr. Diplomat.”",CO166CL10

15916,12,"He was a bachelor, by virtue of circumstance rather than vocation. As a young man he had enjoyed several passing flirtations, but, as time passed, the itching for rank and status had set in, and it was this that prolonged his bachelorhood until he was forty-one, the age at which we now see him. He hoped for a bride superior to both him and the circles in which he moved, and he wasted his time in waiting for her.",CO166CL10
15917,13,"He even attended dances given by a rich and celebrated lawyer for whom he transcribed documents, and who made him his protégé. At these dances, however, he occupied the same subaltern position he held at the office; he would spend the evening wandering the hallways, peering into the ballroom, watching the ladies pass by, devouring with his eyes a multitude of magnificent shoulders and elegant figures. He envied the other men and imitated them. He would leave full of enthusiasm and determination.",CO166CL10
15918,14,"When there were no dances, he would attend religious processions, where he could feast his eyes on some of the most eligible young ladies in the city. He was also to be found in the courtyard of the imperial palace on gala days, watching the great ladies and gentlemen of the court, together with ministers, generals, diplomats, and high court judges; he recognized everyone and everything, both the individuals themselves and their carriages. He would return from church or palace just as he returned from a ball, feeling impetuous and passionate, ready to grasp the laurels of fortune.",CO166CL10
15919,15,"The worst of it is that between hand and branch stood that wall of which the poet spoke, and Rangel was not a man to leap over walls. Everything that he did, from razing cities to carrying off their womenfolk, he did only in his imagination. More than once he imagined himself a minister of state, wallowing in a surfeit of salutations and decrees.",CO166CL10
15920,16,"One year, on the second of December, as he was returning from the birthday parade on Largo do Paço, he even went so far as to proclaim himself emperor; to this end he envisaged a revolution, in which some blood was spilled, but only a little, followed by a benevolent dictatorship, in which he merely took revenge for a few minor grudges from his days as a court clerk. However, all his daring deeds were but fairy tales. In reality, he was a quiet, discreet fellow.",CO166CL10
15921,17,"By the time he reached forty, he had given up on his grandiose ambitions, but his essential nature remained the same, and, notwithstanding his desire to marry, he failed to find a bride. More than one lady would have accepted him willingly, but he lost them all because he was too cautious, too circumspect. One day, he noticed Joaninha, who was nearly nineteen and had a pair of eyes that were both beautiful and meek—undefiled by any masculine conversation. Rangel had known her since she was a child; he had carried her in his arms in the Passeio Público and to see the fireworks at Lapa. How could he speak to her of love? But, on the other hand, his relations with the family were such that a marriage should be easy to arrange; it was either her or nothing at all.",CO166CL10
15922,18,"This time, the wall was not high and the branch within his grasp; he needed only to stretch out his arm with a modicum of effort and pluck it from its stem.

He would not, however, reach out his arm without first checking all around him to see that no one was coming, and if he spied someone, he would hide his intentions and continue on his way.",CO166CL10
15923,19,"Whenever he did reach out, a gust of wind would set the branch swaying or a little bird would make a rustling noise in the dry leaves, and that was all it needed for him to withdraw his hand. And so time passed and his passions deepened, giving him many hours of anguish, always followed by higher hopes. And so, on this very night, the Feast of Saint John, he is carrying with him his first love letter, ready to deliver. Two or three good opportunities have already presented themselves, but he keeps putting off the moment; the night is still young! Meanwhile, he carries on reading out fortunes with all the solemnity of a high priest.",CO166CL10

15928,24,"Couples talking, epaulets gleaming, men bowing, fans beckoning; all this could be glimpsed through the windows, which did not reveal the entire ballroom, but the rest could be imagined. He, at least, knew all of it, and described everything to the clerk’s daughter.

He began pointing out the various carriages to Joaninha: this one’s the Marquis of Olinda’s, that one belongs to the Viscount of Maranguape, and look, here comes another one, turning into the street from Rua da Lapa. It pulls up opposite: the footman jumps down, opens the carriage door, removes his hat, and stands at attention.

15935,31,“What a shame Calisto isn’t here!” sighed the court clerk.,CO166CL10
15936,32,“Did he actually say he was coming?”,CO166CL10
15937,33,"“He did; indeed, he came to the office yesterday for the sole purpose of telling me he would be arriving late, but that he would definitely make it; he had to stop by first at some jolly down in Rua da Carioca.”",CO166CL10
15938,34,“Room for two?” boomed a voice from the hallway.,CO166CL10
15939,35,"“Thank goodness for that! Here he is, the man himself!”",CO166CL10
15940,36,"João Viegas went to open the door; it was indeed Calisto, accompanied by an unknown young man, whom he presented to the general gathering:",CO166CL10
15941,37,"“This is Queirós; he works at the Santa Casa Hospital; no relation of mine whatsoever, although he does look awfully like me—people are always mixing us up . . .”",CO166CL10
15942,38,"Everyone laughed; it was one of Calisto’s little jokes, for he was as ugly as sin, whereas Queirós was a handsome young man of twenty-six or twenty-seven, with dark hair, dark eyes, and a strikingly slender figure. The young ladies drew back a little. Dona Felismina unfurled her sails.",CO166CL10
15943,39,"“We’re playing a parlor game and you two gentlemen are very welcome to join us,” said the lady of the house. “Will you play, Senhor Queirós?”",CO166CL10
15944,40,"Queirós said he would be delighted and looked around at the other guests. He knew some of them, and exchanged a few words of greetings. He told João Viegas that he had been wanting to meet him for quite some time, on account of a favor his father owed him from many years before, concerning a legal matter. João Viegas had forgotten all about it, even when Queirós told him what the favor had been, but he enjoyed hearing such things said in public, and basked for a few minutes in quiet, smug contentment.",CO166CL10
15945,41,"Queirós threw himself into the game. Within half an hour he had made himself one of the family. He was a lively fellow, who talked easily, and his manners were natural and spontaneous. He charmed the whole gathering with his vast repertoire of penalties, and indeed there was no one better than him at leading the game, rushing from one side to the other with such vivacity and animation, putting groups together, moving chairs, chatting with the young ladies as if they had all been playmates since childhood.",CO166CL10
15946,42,"“Dona Joaninha sits here, on this chair; Dona Cesária stands over on that side, and Senhor Camilo comes in through this door . . . No, not that way. Look: like this, and then . . .”",CO166CL10
15947,43,"Sitting stiffly on his chair, Rangel was speechless. Where had this hurricane blown in from? And the hurricane continued to blow, lifting the men’s hats and tousling the ladies’ hair, and all of them laughing merrily: Queirós here, Queirós there, Queirós everywhere. Rangel went from stupefaction to mortification. Slowly, the scepter was falling from his grasp. He didn’t look at the other man, didn’t laugh at anything he said, and answered him only curtly.",CO166CL10
15948,44,"Inside, he was seething with rage and cursing the man, one of those happy fools who knows how to amuse people and make them laugh, because that’s what happens at parties. But not even telling himself these and even worse things restored his peace of mind. In the innermost depths of his self-esteem, he was really suffering. Worse still, the other man saw this, and, worst of all, knew he was the cause of it.",CO166CL10
15949,45,"Just as he dreamt of future glories, Rangel also dreamt of revenge. In his head, he pounded Queirós to a pulp. Then he imagined some sort of disaster befalling his rival; a sudden pain would do, something serious enough to get rid of the interloper entirely. But no pain appeared, nothing at all; the wretch seemed to grow merrier by the minute, and the whole room fell under his spell. Even Joaninha, normally so timid, quivered with excitement in Queirós’s hands, as did the other young ladies; all the guests, men and women, seemed to be at his beck and call. When he mentioned dancing, all the young ladies rushed over to Uncle Rufino and asked him to play a quadrille on his flute, just one, promising not to ask for any more.",CO166CL10
15950,46,"“I can’t, I’ve got a callus on my finger.”",CO166CL10
15951,47,"“The flute?” exclaimed Calisto. “Ask Queirós to play something and then you’ll see what a flute can really do. Go and get your flute, Rufino. Come on, everyone, listen to Queirós. You can’t imagine how hauntingly he plays!”",CO166CL10
15952,48,"Queirós played “Casta Diva.” “Utterly ridiculous,” Rangel muttered to himself, “even the kids in the street are whistling that tune.” He shot Queirós a sideways glance, trying to determine whether any serious man would ever stand with his arms like that, and concluded that the flute was indeed a grotesque instrument. He also looked at Joaninha and saw that, like everyone else, her eyes were on Queirós, enraptured, carried away by the sounds of the aria. He shuddered, although without quite knowing why.",CO166CL10
15953,49,"Joaninha’s expression was no different from everyone else’s, and yet he felt something which added a further complication to his dislike of the interloper. When Queirós finished playing, Joaninha clapped less loudly than the others, and Rangel was unsure whether to attribute this to her usual shyness or to some other emotion. He urgently needed to give her that letter.",CO166CL10
15954,50,"Supper was served. The guests entered the dining room in no particular order and, happily for Rangel, he found himself opposite Joaninha, whose eyes were more beautiful than ever and so bright they scarcely seemed the same eyes at all. Rangel savored them in silence, and carefully pieced back together the dream that wretch Queirós had so abruptly shattered with a snap of his fingers.",CO166CL10
15955,51,"Once again he saw himself by her side, in the house he would rent for them, their little love nest, adorned with all the golden ornaments of his imagination. He would even win a prize in the lottery and spend it all on silks and jewels for his dear wife, the lovely Joaninha, Joaninha Rangel, Dona Joaninha Rangel, Dona Joana Viegas Rangel, or even Dona Joana Cândida Viegas Rangel—he couldn’t leave out the Cândida.",CO166CL10
15956,52,"“Come on, a toast, Mr. Diplomat. Give us one of your famous toasts!”",CO166CL10
15957,53,"Rangel awoke from his reverie; the whole table joined in Uncle Rufino’s request; Joaninha herself was begging him to propose a toast, just like last year’s. Rangel promised to oblige, just as soon as he had polished off his chicken wing. There were general stirrings and murmurings of praise; when one of the young ladies confided that she had never heard Rangel speak, Dona Adelaide replied in astonishment:",CO166CL10
15958,54,"“Really? Goodness gracious, you can’t imagine how well he speaks: so very clearly, and with such well-chosen words, and such refinement!”",CO166CL10
15959,55,"As he ate, he rehearsed a few thoughts and fragments of ideas that would form the basis of his fine phrases and metaphors. When he was ready, he stood up with an air of self-satisfaction. At last, they were coming knocking at his door. The merry-go-round of anecdotes and mindless jokes was over and they had come to him for something dignified and serious. He looked around and saw all eyes fixed expectantly on him. Not quite all; Joaninha’s were turned toward Queirós, whose eyes met hers halfway, along with a cavalcade of promises. Rangel blanched. The words died in his throat, but speak he must; everyone was eagerly, silently waiting for him.",CO166CL10
15960,56,"His efforts failed to impress. He merely toasted their host and his daughter. The latter he called “a divine inspiration, transported from immortality to reality,” a phrase he had used three years earlier, but that should by now have faded from memory. He spoke also of the sanctuary of family, the altar of friendship, and of gratitude being the flowering of pure hearts. What it lacked in meaning, it made up for in empty grandiloquence. All in all, it was a speech that should have stretched to a good ten minutes, but which he dispatched in five, then sat down.",CO166CL10
15961,57,"That wasn’t the end of it. Queirós stood up two or three minutes later for another toast, and this time the silence was even more immediate and complete. Joaninha stared into her lap, embarrassed at what he might say. Rangel shuddered.",CO166CL10
15962,58,"“Senhor Rangel, the illustrious friend of this house,” said Queirós, “drank to the two people who share the name of the saint we commemorate today; I drink to the person who is a saint every day of the year, Dona Adelaide.”",CO166CL10
15963,59,"Loud applause greeted this worthy sentiment, and Dona Adelaide, greatly flattered, was congratulated by each and every guest. Her daughter did not stop at congratulations.",CO166CL10
15964,60,"“Mama! Dearest Mama!” she exclaimed, getting up from her seat and going over to hug and kiss her mother three or four times—a sort of letter, as it were, to be read by two people.",CO166CL10
15965,61,"Rangel’s anger turned to despondency and, as soon as supper was finished, he decided it was time to leave. But hope, that green-eyed demon, begged him to stay, and he stayed. Who knows? It might blow over, a St. John’s Eve flirtation; he was, after all, a good friend of the family, held in high esteem, and the young lady’s hand was his for the asking. Furthermore, that Queirós fellow might well not have the means to marry. What was that job of his at the hospital?",CO166CL10
15966,62,"Something menial, perhaps? He glanced at Queirós’s clothes, running his eyes over the seams, scrutinizing the embroidery on his shirt, examining the knees of his trousers to see if they were worn from use, also his shoes, and he concluded that Queirós was a capricious young man who probably spent all his money on himself, whereas marriage was a serious business. Also, he might well have a widowed mother, unmarried sisters. Rangel had only himself to provide for.",CO166CL10

15970,66,"“Half the winnings for you, half for me,” she said, smiling; he smiled, too, and accepted.",CO166CL10
15971,67,"They sat down side by side. Joaninha talked, laughed, looked up at him with her beautiful eyes, and glanced restlessly around at her at the other guests. Rangel felt a little better, and in no time at all felt entirely better. He marked off the numbers randomly, missing some of them, which she pointed out with her finger—a nymph’s finger, he said to himself, and his mistakes became deliberate, just so he could see her finger and hear her scold him:",CO166CL10

15973,69,"Rangel thought of slipping her the letter under the table, but since nothing had been said between them, she would be taken too much by surprise, and that would spoil everything. Best to say something first. He looked around the table: all the faces were bent over their cards, attentively following the numbers. Then he leaned to his right and looked down at Joaninha’s cards, as if checking something.",CO166CL10

15981,77,"“Oh, Senhor Rangel! Senhor Rangel!”",CO166CL10
15982,78,"Rangel listened with exquisite delight; her voice was so soft, her tone so amicable that he forgot everything, seized her by the waist, and launched them both into the eternal waltz of the chimeras. House, table, guests, all vanished as if they were mere fancies, leaving the two of them as the one true reality, turning and turning in space beneath a million stars that shone for them and them alone.",CO166CL10
15983,79,"No letter, nothing. As dawn approached, they all went to the window to watch the guests leaving the ball across the street. Rangel recoiled in horror. He saw Queirós and the lovely Joaninha brush fingers. He tried to explain this away as a mere illusion, but no sooner had he demolished one such illusion than up sprang another and another, breaking over him like never-ending waves. He could scarcely believe that a single night, a few hours, could be enough to bind two creatures together like that, but the proof was there in their gestures, their eyes, their words, their laughter, and even in the regret with which they parted in the early hours of the morning.",CO166CL10
15984,80,"He left, feeling bewildered. A single night! A few hours! When he arrived home late, he lay down on his bed, not in order to sleep, but to sob. Only now, alone, did all his affectations desert him; no longer was he the haughty Mr. Diplomat, he was the crazed madman, tossing and turning on his bed, screaming and bawling like a child, made truly miserable by his sad autumnal love. The poor devil, made of daydreams, indolence, and pretension, was, in substance, as wretched as Othello, and had met a still crueler fate.",CO166CL10

As you may know, there is in all things a philosophical sense.",CO104CL07

I’m not saying it isn’t, but why did he not add that, many times, one hour is the representation of a lifetime? You see this guy: he enters the world with a great ambition, responsibilities of a minister, a Bank, a Viscount’s crown, a pastoral staff. At fifty, we could still find him working as a simple customs clerk, or as a sexton in the country. All this that happened in thirty years, any Balzac could have put it in three hundred pages.

Scribes were wrapping up their work: they were cleaning up the goose at the tip of black silk that hung from one of the drawers to the side. They closed the drawers, picked up all the papers, packed up the books, washed their hands, and those who had changed their jackets when they came in, changed from their work clothes into street clothes and off they went. Everyone left. Vaz Nunes was left alone.",CO104CL07

He could smell the tricks and secret thoughts.",CO104CL07

He was fifty years old, a widower without children, and to speak like some of the other clerks, he quietly gnawed on his two hundred contos de réis.",CO104CL07

He obeyed, greeted him, shook his hand, and sat in the chair at the foot of the table. He did not carry the shame natural to a beggar, quite the opposite. He looked like he had come there only to give the notary something precious and rare. And yet, Vaz Nunes shivered and waited.",CO104CL07

16001,15,"Although this is useless information, it is indeed necessary to add a certain double air that distinguished this man. He had the air of a beggar and that of a general. On the streets, wandering without having eaten lunch and without a penny in his pocket, he seemed to have an army following him. The cause was not anything more than the contrast between nature and situation, between soul and life. This Custódio was born with a calling for wealth without a calling for work. He had an instinct for elegance, a love for the superfluous, for good food, for beautiful ladies, for fine carpets, rare furniture… he was voluptuous, and, to some extent, an artist capable to run Torloni village or Hamilton gallery. But he had no money. No money, no aptitude nor patience to make money.",CO104CL07

16003,17,"I say that he mainly lived from them, because Custódio did not refuse to get into some business deals, with the condition that he would choose them, and he always chose the ones that did not pay for anything. He was prone to disasters. Among twenty companies, soon he found the foolish one and put all his heart into it, with determination. The bad luck that chased him, made the first nineteen to prosper, and number twenty to burst in his hands. It didn’t matter; he got ready for the next one.",CO104CL07

Custódio went to the advertiser. It was a great idea: a factory of needles, a new industry of immense future.",CO104CL07
16005,19,"And all the plans, the drawings of the plant, the reports from Birmingham, the import maps, the responses from tailors, from haberdashery owners, etc., all documents that were of a lengthy analysis passed before the eyes of Custódio, like starry algorithms that he did not understand, and therefore they seemed dogmatic.",CO104CL07
16006,20,"Twenty-four hours. He’d asked not more than twenty-four hours to bring the money. And off he went, wooed, excited by the advertiser, who, even as he was leaving, was drowning him in a torrent of balances.

16024,38,"Disillusioned, he looked at the notary with a farewell gesture, but an idea suddenly ignited the light of the night in his brain. If the amount was smaller, Vaz Nunes could help him out, and with pleasure. Why not ask for a smaller amount?

Walking down the street with no breakfast and not a penny in his pocket, he behaved as if he were marching at the head of an army. The reason was none other than the contrast between nature and situation, between soul and life. Custódio had been born with a vocation to be wealthy, but with no vocation for work. He had an instinct for elegance, a love of excess, good food, beautiful ladies, luxuriant carpets, exquisite furniture, a voluptuary (and, up to a point, an artist) capable of running the Villa Torlonia or the Hamilton Gallery.

If it were a smaller amount, Vaz Nunes could provide it, and willingly. So why shouldn’t it be a smaller amount?

He was fifty years old, a childless widower, and, in the words of some of his fellow notaries, he was quietly nibbling his way through the two hundred contos de réis he had salted away.",CO104CL10
16132,8,"“Who’s there?” he asked suddenly, looking up.",CO104CL10
16133,9,"Standing in the doorway was a man whom he did not immediately recognize and whom he only barely recognized afterward. Vaz Nunes invited him in; the man entered, greeted him, shook his hand, and sat down on the chair beside the desk. He did not carry himself with the customary awkwardness of a beggar; on the contrary, he gave every impression of having come with the sole purpose of giving the notary some very precious and rare commodity. Vaz Nunes nevertheless shuddered and waited.",CO104CL10
16134,10,“Don’t you remember me?”,CO104CL10
16135,11,"“No, I don’t.”",CO104CL10
16136,12,"“We were with each other one night a few months ago, in Tijuca. Don’t you remember? In Teodorico’s house, at that magnificent Christmas Eve supper. As a matter of fact, I proposed a toast to you. Surely you remember old Custódio!”",CO104CL10
16137,13,“Ah!”,CO104CL10
16138,14,"Custódio sat up straighter, having been sitting somewhat slumped. He was a man of about forty. Poorly dressed, but well groomed, neat, and very correct. He had long nails, neatly trimmed, and his hands were slender and soft, unlike the skin on his face, which was somewhat lined.",CO104CL10
16139,15,"Minor details, but necessary to illustrate a certain duality in the man, an air of being both a beggar and a general. Walking down the street with no breakfast and not a penny in his pocket, he behaved as if he were marching at the head of an army. The reason was none other than the contrast between nature and situation, between soul and life. Custódio had been born with a vocation to be wealthy, but with no vocation for work. He had an instinct for elegance, a love of excess, good food, beautiful ladies, luxuriant carpets, exquisite furniture, a voluptuary (and, up to a point, an artist) capable of running the Villa Torlonia or the Hamilton Gallery. But he had no money; neither money nor the aptitude or patience to earn it. And yet, on the other hand, he needed to live.",CO104CL10
16140,16,"Il faut bien que je vive, a man in search of a favor once said to Talleyrand. Je n’en vois pas la nécessité, the minister replied coldly. Nobody gave this answer to Custódio; they gave him money instead—someone would give him ten mil-réis, another would give five, another twenty, and it was principally from such small donations that he paid his bed and board.",CO104CL10
16141,17,"I say “principally,” because Custódio did not hold back from involving himself in various business deals, but always on condition that he could choose them, and he always chose the ones that were doomed to fail. He had an excellent nose for disasters. From among twenty businesses, he could immediately pluck the most foolhardy, and would plunge in resolutely. The bad luck that pursued him would ensure that the other nineteen would prosper, while the one he chose would blow up in his face. No matter; he would pick himself up and get ready for the next.",CO104CL10
16142,18,"He had, for example, recently read an advertisement in the paper seeking a business partner willing to invest five contos de réis in a certain enterprise that promised, within the first six months, to return a profit of between eighty and a hundred contos. Custódio went to meet the person who had placed the advertisement. It was a great idea: a needle factory, a brand-new business with an exciting future.",CO104CL10
16143,19,"And the plans, the design of the factory, the reports from Birmingham, the lists of imports, the replies from tailors and haberdashers and other such merchants, all swam before Custódio’s eyes, dazzled by figures he could not understand, and which, for that very reason, appeared to be the gospel truth.",CO104CL10
16144,20,"Twenty-four hours; he asked for twenty-four hours to find the five contos. And he left the place, flattered and fawned upon by the advertiser, who, still standing on the doorstep, continued to deluge him with a torrent of credit and debit balances. But the five contos— five thousand mil-réis, no less—proved less biddable or less fickle than a mere five mil-réis, shaking their heads incredulously and keeping to their coffers, paralyzed by fear and sleep.",CO104CL10
16145,21,"Not one penny. The eight or ten friends he spoke to all told him they didn’t have that amount of money available, nor did they have any faith in the factory. He had just about lost all hope when he happened to find himself in Rua do Rosário and saw the name Vaz Nunes above the doorway of a notary’s office. His heart leapt with joy, remembering Tijuca, the notary’s impeccable manners, the kind words with which he responded to the toast, and he said to himself that here was the man to save the situation.",CO104CL10

There are three of us in the partnership; my share is five contos and I’ve come to ask you to lend me that amount for six months—or even three, at a reasonable rate of interest . . .”",CO104CL10

16156,32,"Custódio’s spirits sank. He had climbed up Jacob’s ladder to heaven, but instead of descending like the angels in the biblical dream, he had tumbled down and fallen flat on his face. This was his last hope, and precisely because it had arisen so unexpectedly, he was convinced it would bear fruit, since, like all souls who trust themselves to happenstance, Custódio was a superstitious man. The poor wretch could feel his body being pierced all over by every one of those millions of needles that the factory would undoubtedly produce during its first six months.",CO104CL10
16157,33,"Speechless, eyes downcast, he waited for the notary to continue, to take pity on him and give him a chance. But, sensing this, the notary remained equally silent, turning his snuff box around and around in his hand, and breathing heavily, with a certain knowing, nasal whistle. Custódio attempted every possible pose, now a beggar, now a general. The notary would not be moved. Custódio stood up.",CO104CL10

16160,36,"He reached out to shake hands with Custódio, who mechanically tipped his hat with his other hand. Custódio’s dull stare revealed the state of his soul, barely recovered from its fall, which had drained him of his last ounce of energy. No mysterious ladder and no heaven; everything had vanished at the snap of a notary’s fingers. Farewell, needles!",CO104CL10
16161,37,"Reality once again gripped him with its bronze talons. He would have to return to his precarious, unplanned existence, to his old account books with their goggle-eyed zeros and wiggly-eared $-signs, that would continue to stare and listen, listen and stare, dangling before him the implacable numerology of hunger. What a fall! And into what an abyss!",CO104CL10
16162,38,"Realizing the truth of his situation, he looked at the notary as if to say goodbye, but an idea suddenly lit up the dark night of his brain. If it were a smaller amount, Vaz Nunes could provide it, and willingly. So why shouldn’t it be a smaller amount? He had already given up the idea of the business adventure; but he could scarcely do the same with his rent arrears and his various other creditors. A reasonable sum, five hundred mil-réis, for example, would do nicely, if he could only persuade the notary to lend it to him.",CO104CL10
16163,39,"Custódio’s spirits rose; he would live for the present and have nothing to do with the past, no regrets or fears, no remorse. The present was all that mattered. The present was the five hundred mil-réis that he would watch emerging from the notary’s pocket like a certificate of emancipation.",CO104CL10

16172,48,"Custódio interrupted him, slapping his thigh. Whether this was a natural gesture or a crafty diversion to avoid discussing a potential job, I have absolutely no idea; nor does it seem an essential element of the story. What is essential, though, is that he persisted in his request. Could the notary really not give him five hundred mil-réis? He would take two hundred; two hundred would be enough, not for the factory, for he would follow his friends’ advice and turn it down.",CO104CL10
16173,49,"Two hundred mil-réis, seeing that the notary was disposed to help him, would meet an urgent need, to “fill a hole,” as he put it. And then he told the notary everything, meeting frankness with frankness, for that was his rule of life. He admitted that, in dealing with the business proposal, he also had in mind settling matters with a particularly persistent creditor, a devil of a fellow and a Jew, who, strictly speaking, still owed him, but had treacherously turned the tables on him. It was two hundred and something mil-réis; two hundred and ten, to be precise; but he would accept two hundred—",CO104CL10
16174,50,"“Really, it pains me to repeat what I’ve already said, but there we are; even two hundred mil-réis is beyond my means. Even if you were to ask me for a hundred mil-réis, that would still exceed my capabilities at this particular time. On another occasion, possibly, I’m sure, but not right now . . .”",CO104CL10
16175,51,“You can’t imagine the tricky situation I find myself in!”,CO104CL10

You probably don’t believe me, do you, given that I do own some property, but, my friend, it is indeed a fine thing to own houses, but what you don’t see is all the wear and tear, the repairs, the water pipes, the tithes, the insurance, the rent arrears, and all the rest of it. They’re the holes in the pot through which most of the water is lost . . .”",CO104CL10

16181,57,"He stood up and stepped forward into the middle of the room. Custódio did likewise, impelled by necessity and desperation. He could not bring himself to believe that the notary did not have at least a hundred mil-réis. Who on earth doesn’t have a hundred mil-réis?",CO104CL10
16182,58,"He considered making a pathetic scene, but the notary’s office opened directly onto the street and he didn’t want to appear ridiculous. He peered outside. In the shop across the street a man was asking the price of a frock coat; he was standing at the door because dusk was coming on and it was already dark in the shop. The clerk was holding up the item of clothing for the customer, who was examining the cloth with eyes and fingers, then the seams, the lining . . .",CO104CL10
16183,59,"The incident opened up a new horizon to Custódio, albeit a modest one: it was high time he replaced the jacket he was wearing. But the notary couldn’t even give him fifty mil-réis. Custódio smiled, not scornfully or angrily, but bitterly and hesitantly. It was impossible that the man didn’t have fifty mil-réis. Twenty, at least? Not twenty. Not even twenty! No, it was all pretense, all lies.",CO104CL10
16184,60,"Custódio pulled out his handkerchief, slowly smoothed his hat, then put his handkerchief back in his pocket and straightened his tie, with a mixture of hope and resentment. He had gradually been trimming the wings of his ambitions, feather by feather, but there still remained a fine, furry down, which gave him the foolish idea that he could fly. The other man, however, remained unmoved. Vaz Nunes was checking his pocket watch with the clock on the wall, holding it to his ear, cleaning the watch face, quietly oozing impatience and annoyance from every pore.",CO104CL10
16185,61,"The clock’s hands were creeping toward five. Finally, the hour struck, and the notary was at last able to begin his farewells. It was late; he lived far away. As he said this, he took off his alpaca jacket and put on the cashmere one, transferring from one to the other his snuffbox, handkerchief, and wallet.",CO104CL10
16186,62,"Oh, the wallet! Custódio saw this problematic item, caressed it with his eyes, envying the alpaca, envying the cashmere, wishing he could be the pocket, wishing he could be the leather, the material of the precious receptacle itself. There it went, plunged straight into the inside left-hand pocket of the jacket, which the notary swiftly buttoned up. Not even twenty mil-réis! It was impossible that he didn’t have twenty mil-réis on him, thought Custódio; perhaps not two hundred, but certainly twenty, or ten . . .",CO104CL10
16187,63,"“Right, then!” said Vaz Nunes, putting on his hat.",CO104CL10
16188,64,"It was the fateful moment. Not a word from the notary, not even an invitation to dine with him; nothing. It was the end of the road. But supreme moments call for supreme efforts. Custódio felt this cliché in all its strength, and, suddenly, like a shot, he asked the notary if he couldn’t at least give him ten mil-réis.",CO104CL10
16189,65,“Shall I show you?”,CO104CL10

16192,68,"Custódio accepted the five mil-réis, not glumly or with bad grace, but smiling, indeed as thrilled as if he had just conquered Asia Minor. There was his dinner taken care of. He shook the other man’s hand, thanked him for his kindness, bade him farewell for now—a “for now” full of implicit meanings. Then he left; the beggar slipping out the door of the notary’s office and the general marching boldly down the street, nodding fraternally to the English merchants making their way up toward the suburbs.",CO104CL10

16198,5,"You already know that this took place in 1860. The year before, about the month of August, at the age of forty-two, I had become a theologian—that is, I copied the theological studies of a priest at Nictheroy, an old college-chum, who thus tactfully gave me my board and lodging. In that same month of August, 1859, he received a letter from the vicar of a small town in the interior, asking if he knew of an intelligent, discreet and patient person who would be willing, in return for generous wages, to serve as attendant to the invalid Colonel Felisbert. The priest proposed that I take the place, and I accepted it eagerly, for I was tired of copying Latin quotations and ecclesiastic formulas. First I went to Rio de Janeiro to take leave of a brother who lived at the capital, and from there I departed for the little village of the interior.",C157CL01

He had used more attendants than medicines. In fact he had broken the faces of two of them. But to all this I replied that I had no fear of persons in good health, still less of invalids. So, after first visiting the vicar, who confirmed all that I had heard and recommended to me charity and forbearance, I turned toward the colonel's residence.",C157CL01
16200,7,"I found him on the veranda of his house, stretched out on a chair and suffering greatly. He received me fairly well. At first he examined me silently, piercing me with his two feline eyes; then a kind of malicious smile spread over his features, which were rather hard.

16204,11,"If I recall this incident, it is not only because it seems to me to give a good picture of the colonel, but also to show you that my reply made a very good impression upon him.

16205,12,"From the dawn of the eighth day I knew the life of my predecessors—a dog's life. I no longer slept. I no longer thought of anything, I was showered with insults and laughed at them from time to time with an air of resignation and submission, for I had discovered that this was a way of pleasing him. His impertinences proceeded as much from his malady as from his temperament.",C157CL01
16206,13,"His illness was of the most complicated: he suffered from aneurism, rheumatism and three or four minor affections. He was nearly sixty, and since he had been five years old had been accustomed to having everybody at his beck and call. That he was surly one could well forgive; but he was also very malicious. He took pleasure in the grief and the humiliation of others. At the end of three months I was tired of putting up with him and had resolved to leave; only the opportunity was lacking.",C157CL01

With time I became hardened, I no longer heeded anything; I was an ignoramus, a camel, a bumpkin, an idiot, a loggerhead—I was everything! It must further be understood that I alone was favored with these pretty names.",C157CL01

As to friends, those who came now and then to flatter him and indulge his whims made him but a short visit, five or ten minutes at the most. I alone was always present to receive his dictionary of insults. More than once I resolved to leave him; but as the vicar would exhort me not to abandon the colonel I always yielded in the end.",C157CL01
16213,20,"Not only were our relations becoming very much strained, but I was in a hurry to get back to Rio de Janeiro. At forty-two years of age one does not easily accustom himself to perpetual seclusion with a brutal, snarling old invalid, in the depths of a remote village. Just to give you an idea of my isolation, let it suffice to inform you that I didn't even read the newspapers; outside of some more or less important piece of news that was brought to the colonel, I knew nothing of what was doing in the world.",C157CL01

16216,23,"The invalid's treatment became more strict; short intervals of peace and rest became rarer than ever for me. Already I had lost the meagre measure of pity that made me forget the old invalid's excesses; within me there seethed a cauldron of aversion and hatred. At the beginning of the month of August I decided definitely to leave. The vicar and the doctor, finally accepting my explanations, asked me but a few days' more service. I gave them a month. At the end of that time I would depart, whatever might be the condition of the invalid. The vicar promised to find a substitute for me.",C157CL01
16217,24,"You'll see now what happened. On the evening of the 24th of August the colonel had a violent attack of anger; he struck me, he called me the vilest names, he threatened to shoot me; finally he threw in my face a plate of porridge that was too cold for him. The plate struck the wall and broke into a thousand fragments.",C157CL01

While he slept I took a book out of my pocket, a translation of an old d'Arlincourt romance which I had found lying about, and began to read it in his room, at a small distance from his bed. I was to wake him at midnight to give him his medicine; but, whether it was due to fatigue or to the influence of the book, I, too, before reaching the second page, fell asleep.",C157CL01
16220,27,"The cries of the colonel awoke me with a start; in an instant I was up. He, apparently in a delirium, continued to utter the same cries; finally he seized his water-bottle and threw it at my face. I could not get out of the way in time; the bottle hit me in the left cheek, and the pain was so acute that I almost lost consciousness. With a leap I rushed upon the invalid; I tightened my hands around his neck; he struggled several moments; I strangled him.",C157CL01
16221,28,"When I beheld that he no longer breathed, I stepped back in terror. I cried out; but nobody heard me. Then, approaching the bed once more, I shook him so as to bring him back to life. It was too late; the aneurism had burst, and the colonel was dead. I went into the adjoining room, and for two hours I did not dare to return. It is impossible for me to express all that I felt during that time. It was intense stupefaction, a kind of vague and vacant delirium.",C157CL01
16222,29,"It seemed to me that I saw faces grinning on the walls; I heard muffled voices. The cries of the victim, the cries uttered before the struggle and during its wild moments continued to reverberate within me, and the air, in whatever direction I turned, seemed to shake with convulsions. Do not imagine that I am inventing pictures or aiming at verbal style. I swear to you that I heard distinctly voices that were crying at me: ""Murderer; Murderer!""",C157CL01
16223,30,"All was quiet in the house. The tick-tick of the clock, very even, slow, dryly metrical, increased the silence and solitude. I put my ear to the door of the room, in hope of hearing a groan, a word, an insult, anything that would be a sign of life, that might bring back peace to my conscience; I was ready to let myself be struck ten, twenty, a hundred times, by the colonel's hand. But, nothing—all was silent. I began to pace the room aimlessly; I sat down, I brought my hands despairingly to my head; I repented ever having come to the place.",C157CL01
16224,31,"Cursed be the hour in which I ever accepted such a position, I cried. And I flamed with resentment against the priest of Nichteroy, against the doctor, the vicar—against all those who had procured the place for me and forced me to remain there so long. They, too, I convinced myself, were accomplices in my crime.",C157CL01
16225,32,"As the silence finally terrified me, I opened a window, in the hope of hearing at least the murmuring of the wind. But no wind was blowing. The night was peaceful. The stars were sparkling with the indifference of those who remove their hats before a passing funeral procession and continue to speak of other things. I remained at the window for some time, my elbows on the sill, my gaze seeking to penetrate the night, forcing myself to make a mental summary of my life so that I might escape the present agony.",C157CL01
16226,33,"I believe it was only then that I thought clearly about the penalty of my crime. I saw myself already being accused and threatened with dire punishment. From this moment fear complicated my feeling of remorse. I felt my hair stand on end. A few minutes later I saw three or four human shapes spying at me from the terrace, where they seemed to be waiting in ambush; I withdrew; the shapes vanished into the air; it had been an hallucination.",C157CL01
16227,34,"Before daybreak I bandaged the wounds that I had received in the face. Then only did I pluck up enough courage to return to the other room. Twice I started, only to turn back; but it must be done, so I entered. Even then, I did not at first go to the bed. My legs shook, my heart pounded. I thought of flight; but that would have been a confession of the crime.... It was on the contrary very important for me to hide all traces of it. I approached the bed. I looked at the corpse, with its widely distended eyes and its mouth gaping, as if uttering the eternal reproach of the centuries: ""Cain, what hast thou done with thy brother?""",C157CL01
16228,35,"I discovered on the neck the marks of my nails; I buttoned the shirt to the top, and threw the bed-cover up to the dead man's chin. Then I called a servant and told him that the colonel had died towards morning; I sent him to notify the vicar and the doctor.",C157CL01
16229,36,"The first idea that came to me was to leave as soon as possible under the pretext that my brother was ill; and in reality I had received, several days before, from Rio, a letter telling me that he was not at all well. But I considered that my immediate departure might arouse suspicion, and I decided to wait. I laid out the corpse myself, with the assistance of an old, near-sighted negro.",C157CL01
16230,37,"I remained continually in the room of the dead. I trembled lest something out of the way should be discovered. I wanted to assure myself that no mistrust could be read upon the faces of the others; but I did not dare to look any person in the eye. Everything made me impatient; the going and coming of those who, on tip-toe crossed the room; their whisperings; the ceremonies and the prayers of the vicar.... The hour having come, I closed the coffin, but with trembling hands, so trembling that somebody noticed it and commented upon it aloud, with pity.",C157CL01
16231,38,"Poor Procopio! Despite what he has suffered from his master, he is strongly moved.",C157CL01
16232,39,"It sounded like irony to me. I was anxious to have it all over with. We went out. Once in the street the passing from semi-obscurity to daylight dazed me and I staggered. I began to fear that it would no longer be possible for me to conceal the crime. I kept my eyes steadily fixed upon the ground and took my place in the procession. When all was over, I breathed once more. I was at peace with man. But I was not at peace with my conscience, and the first nights, naturally, I spent in restlessness and affliction. Need I tell you that I hastened to return to Rio de Janeiro, and that I dwelt there in terror and suspense, although far removed from the scene of the crime? I never smiled; I scarcely spoke; I ate very little; I suffered hallucinations and nightmares....",C157CL01
16233,40,"Let the dead rest in peace, they would say to me. ""It is out of all reason to show so much melancholy.""",C157CL01
16234,41,"And I was happy to find how people interpreted my symptoms, and praised the dead man highly, calling him a good soul, surly, in truth, but with a heart of gold. And as I spoke in such wise, I convinced myself, at least for a few moments at a time. Another interesting phenomenon was taking place within me—I tell it to you because you will perhaps make some useful deduction from it—and that was, although I had very little religion in me, I had a mass sung for the eternal rest of the colonel at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament.",C157CL01
16235,42,"I sent out no invitations to it, I did not whisper a word of it to anybody; I went there alone. I knelt during the whole service and made many signs of the cross. I paid the priest double and distributed alms at the door, all in the name of the deceased. I wished to deceive nobody. The proof of this lies in the fact that I did all this without letting any other know. To complete this incident, I may add that I never mentioned the colonel without repeating, ""May his soul rest in peace!"" And I told several funny anecdotes about him, some amusing caprices of his ...",C157CL01
16236,43,"About a week after my arrival at Rio I received a letter from the vicar. He announced that the will of the colonel had been opened and that I was there designated as his sole heir. Imagine my stupefaction! I was sure that I had read wrongly; I showed it to my brother, to friends; they all read the same thing. It was there in black and white, I was really the sole heir of the colonel.",C157CL01
16237,44,"It was there in black and white, I was really the sole heir of the colonel. Then I suddenly thought that this was a trap to catch me, but then I considered that there were other ways of arresting me, if the crime had been discovered. Moreover, I knew the vicar's honesty, and I was sure that he would not be a party to such a plan. I reread the letter five times, ten times, a hundred times; it was true. 
I was the colonel's sole heir! <TRANSLATION ADDED>",C157CL01
16238,45,How much was he worth? my brother asked me.,C157CL01
16239,46,"I don't know, but I know that he was very wealthy.",C157CL01
16240,47,"Really, he's shown that he was a very true friend to you.",C157CL01
16241,48,He certainly was—he was....,C157CL01
16242,49,"Thus, by a strange irony of fate, all the colonel's wealth came into my hands. At first I thought of refusing the legacy. It seemed odious to take a sou of that inheritance; it seemed worse than the reward of a hired assassin. For three days this thought obsessed me; but more and more I was thrust against this consideration: that my refusal would not fail to awake suspicion.",C157CL01
16243,50,"Finally I settled upon a compromise; I would accept the inheritance and would distribute it in small sums, secretly. This was not merely scruple on my part, it was also the desire to redeem my crime by virtuous deeds; and it seemed the only way to recover my peace of mind and feel that accounts were straight.",C157CL01
16244,51,"I made hurried preparations and left. As I neared the little village the sad event returned obstinately to my memory. Everything about the place, as I looked at it once again, suggested tragic deeds. At every turn in the road I seemed to see the ghost of the colonel loom. And despite myself, I evoked in my imagination his cries, his struggles, his looks on that horrible night of the crime....",C157CL01
16245,52,"Crime or struggle? Really, it was rather a struggle; I had been attacked, I had defended myself; and in self-defence.... It had been an unfortunate struggle, a genuine tragedy. This idea gripped me. And I reviewed all the abuse he had heaped upon me; I counted the blows, the names ... It was not the colonel's fault, that I knew well; it was his affliction that made him so peevish and even wicked. But I pardoned all, everything!... The worst of it was the end of that fatal night ...",C157CL01
16246,53,"I also considered that in any case the colonel had not long to live. His days were numbered; did not he himself feel that? Didn't he say every now and then, ""How much longer have I to live? Two weeks, or one, perhaps less?"" This was not life, it was slow agony, if one may so name the continual martyrdom of that poor man.... And who knows, who can say that the struggle and his death were not simply a coincidence? That was after all quite possible, it was even most probable; careful weighing of the matter showed that it couldn't have been otherwise. At length this idea, too, engraved itself upon my mind....",C157CL01
16247,54,"Something tugged at my heart as I entered the village; I wanted to run back; but I dominated my emotions and I pressed forward. I was received with a shower of congratulations. The vicar communicated to me the particulars of the will, enumerated the pious gifts, and, as he spoke, praised the Christian forbearance and the faithfulness which I had shown in my care of the deceased, who, despite his temper and brutality, had so well demonstrated his gratitude.",C157CL01
16248,55,"Certainly, I said, looking nervously around.",C157CL01
16249,56,"I was astounded. Everybody praised my conduct. Such patience, such devotion. The first formalities of the inventory detained me for a while; I chose a solicitor; things followed their course in regular fashion. During this time there was much talk of the colonel. People came and told me tales about him, but without observing the priest's moderation. I defended the memory of the colonel. I recalled his good qualities, his virtues; had he not been austere?...",C157CL01
16250,57,"Austere! they would interrupt. ""Nonsense! He is dead, and it's all over now. But he was a regular demon!""",C157CL01
16251,58,"And they would cite incidents and relate the colonel's perversities, some of which were nothing less than extraordinary. Need I confess it? At first I listened to all this talk with great curiosity; then, a queer pleasure penetrated my heart, a pleasure from which, sincerely, I tried to escape. And I continued to defend the colonel; I explained him, I attributed much of the fault-finding to local animosity; I admitted, yes, I admitted that he had been a trifle exacting, somewhat violent....",C157CL01
16252,59,"Somewhat! Why he was as furious as a snake! exclaimed the barber. And all—the collector, the apothecary, the clerk—all were of the same opinion. And they would start to relate other anecdotes. They reviewed the entire life of the deceased. The old folks took particular delight in recalling the cruelties of his youth. And that queer pleasure, intimate, mute, insidious, grew within me—a sort of moral tape-worm whose coils I tore out in vain, for they would immediately form again and take firmer hold than ever.",C157CL01
16253,60,"The formalities of the inventory afforded me a little relief; moreover, public opinion was so unanimously unfavorable to the colonel that little by little the place lost the lugubrious aspect that had at first struck me. At last I entered into possession of the legacy, which I converted into land-titles and cash.",C157CL01
16254,61,"Several months had elapsed, and the idea of distributing the inheritance in charity and pious donations was by no means so strong as it had at first been; it even seemed to me that this would be sheer affectation. I revised my initial plan; I gave away several insignificant sums to the poor; I presented the village church with a few new ornaments; I gave several thousand francs to the Sacred House of Mercy, etc. I did not forget to erect a monument upon the colonel's grave—a very simple monument, all marble, the work of a Neapolitan sculptor who remained at Rio until 1866, and who has since died, I believe, in Paraguay.",C157CL01
16255,62,"Years have gone by. My memory has become vague and unreliable. Sometimes I think of the colonel, but without feeling again the terrors of those early days. All the doctors to whom I have described his afflictions have been unanimous as regards the inevitable end in store for the invalid, and were indeed surprised that he should so long have resisted. It is just possible that I may have involuntarily exaggerated the description of his various symptoms; but the truth is that he was sure of sudden death, even had this fatality not occurred....",C157CL01
16256,63,"Good-bye, my dear sir. If you deem these notes not totally devoid of value reward me for them with a marble tomb, and place there for my epitaph this variant which I have  made of the divine sermon on the mount: ""Blessed are they who possess, for they shall be consoled.""",C157CL01

16258,2,"SO YOU REALLY THINK that what happened to me in 1860 could be made into a story? Very well, but on the sole condition that nothing is published before my death. You’ll only have to wait a week at most, for I’m really not long for this world.",CO157CL12
16259,3,"I could even tell you my whole life story, which contains various other interesting episodes, but that would require time, energy, and paper, and I only have paper; my energy is low and time for me is like the guttering flame of a night lamp. Soon the sun will rise on a new day, a terrible sun, impenetrable as life itself.",CO157CL12
16260,4,"Farewell, my dear friend; read on and wish me well, forgive anything that offends, and don’t be surprised if not everything smells of roses. You asked me for a human document and here you have it. Do not ask me for the empire of the Great Mogul or a photograph of the Maccabees. Ask me, on the other hand, for my dead man’s shoes, and they will be yours and yours alone.",CO157CL12
16261,5,"As you know, these events took place in 1860. Sometime around August of the preceding year, when I was forty-two, I became a theologian—or rather, I began copying out theological tracts for a priest in Niterói, an old friend from school, who thereby tactfully provided me with room and board. During that month of August 1859, he received a letter from a fellow priest in a certain provincial town, who asked him if he knew of a discreet, intelligent, patient fellow who would be willing to go and serve as gentleman’s companion to a Colonel Felisberto, in return for a decent wage. My friend duly consulted me, and I gladly accepted, for I was already becoming fed up with copying out Latin quotations and ecclesiastical formulas. I returned to Rio to say goodbye to a brother of mine, then set off for the provinces.",CO157CL12
16262,6,"When I arrived in the town, I heard dire reports about the colonel. He was, it seemed, a quite unbearable man, eccentric and demanding; no one, it was said, could stand him, not even his friends. He had been through more gentleman’s companions than medicines. Indeed, he had punched two of them in the face. I replied that I was not afraid of healthy folk, still less of the sick; and after discussing matters with the priest, who confirmed what I had heard and recommended an attitude of meekness and loving charity, I proceeded to the colonel’s residence.",CO157CL12
16263,7,"I found him stretched out in a chair on the veranda, breathing heavily. He did not receive me badly; at first he said nothing and merely fixed me with his eyes like a watchful cat. Then a malevolent smile spread across his harsh features. Finally, he told me that none of his previous gentleman’s companions had been any use at all—always sleeping, answering back, chasing after the female slaves. Two of them had been downright thieves!",CO157CL12
16264,8,“Are you a thief?”,CO157CL12
16265,9,"“No, sir.”",CO157CL12
16266,10,"Then he asked me my name. I told him and he looked startled. Colombo? No, sir: Procópio José Gomes Valongo. Valongo? He thought this a preposterous name and proposed calling me just plain Procópio, to which I replied that he could call me whatever he pleased.",CO157CL12
16267,11,"I’m telling you this detail not just because I think it gives you an idea of what he was like, but also because my reply made a very favorable impression on the colonel. He himself said so to the priest, adding that I was the most agreeable of all the gentleman’s companions he’d had. The honeymoon lasted for seven days.",CO157CL12
16268,12,"On the eighth day, my life became exactly the same as that of my predecessors. It was a dog’s life, with no sleep, no thoughts of my own, and being constantly showered with insults, which, at times, I laughed at with an air of resignation and deference, for I had noticed that this was one way of mollifying him.",CO157CL12
16269,13,"His rudeness stemmed as much from his illness as from his temperament, for he suffered from a litany of complaints: an aneurism, rheumatism, and three or four lesser afflictions. He was nearly sixty, and from the age of five everyone had indulged his every whim. Had he been merely grumpy, that would have been fine; but he had a mean streak in him, and took pleasure in the pain and humiliation of others. At the end of three months I’d had enough and decided to leave; I waited only for the right opportunity.",CO157CL12
16270,14,"It wasn’t long in coming. One day, when I failed to give him his embrocation at the correct time, he grabbed his stick and struck me two or three times. That was the last straw; I quit there and then and went to pack my bags. Later, he came to my room and begged me to stay, saying that there was no need to take offense at an old man’s bad temper. He was so insistent that I stayed.",CO157CL12
16271,15,"“I’m in a terrible pickle, Procópio,” he told me that night. “I won’t live much longer. One foot in the grave, you might say. But you must go to my funeral, Procópio; I absolutely insist. You must go, and you must pray at my graveside. If you don’t,” he added with a chuckle, “I’ll come back at night and torment you. Do you believe in spirits from the other world, Procópio?”",CO157CL12
16272,16,“Certainly not!”,CO157CL12
16273,17,"“Why wouldn’t you believe, you donkey?” he retorted excitedly, opening his eyes very wide.",CO157CL12
16274,18,"If these were the truces, just imagine the wars! He stopped hitting me with the stick, but the insults were just as bad, if not worse. With time I became inured to them and stopped noticing; I was an ass, a dolt, an idiot, a good-for-nothing lazybones, everything under the sun. There wasn’t even anyone to share these insults with me.",CO157CL12
16275,19,"He had no relatives; there had been a nephew up in Minas Gerais, but he had died of consumption sometime between the end of May and the beginning of July. His friends came by occasionally to flatter and indulge him; a five- or ten-minute visit, nothing more. So there was no one but me, just me, for an entire dictionary of expletives. More than once I resolved to leave, but each time, at the priest’s insistence, I ended up staying.",CO157CL12
16276,20,"Not only were relations between us becoming increasingly strained, I was also keen to return to Rio. At forty-two I wasn’t yet ready to become a complete recluse tending to a petulant old invalid in the back of beyond. To get an idea of my isolation, suffice it to say that I didn’t even read the newspapers; apart from the odd piece of news that reached the colonel, I was totally cut off from the rest of the world.",CO157CL12
16277,21,"I therefore decided to return to the capital at the first opportunity, even if it meant crossing swords with the local priest. Seeing as I’m making a general confession, I should perhaps add that, since I was spending nothing and saving up all of my wages, I was eager to come and squander them here in the city.",CO157CL12
16278,22,"Such an opportunity seemed imminent. The colonel’s health was steadily deteriorating and he had drawn up his will, managing to offend the notary almost as much as he had me.",CO157CL12
16279,23,"His manners became ever coarser, and the brief lapses of peace and affability were now rare. I had already lost the meager dose of pity that had made me overlook the sick man’s excesses; inside, I was seething with hatred and revulsion. At the beginning of August, I resolved definitively to go; the priest and the doctor, while accepting my reasons, asked me to stay just a little longer. I granted them one month; at the end of the month I would leave, no matter what the patient’s condition. The priest took it upon himself to find my replacement.",CO157CL12
16280,24,"Now here comes the event itself. On the evening of the twenty-fourth of August, the colonel fell into a fit of rage and knocked me down, calling me all sorts of vile names, threatening to shoot me, even ending up by throwing a bowl of porridge at me because he said it had gone cold. The bowl hit the wall and shattered into pieces.",CO157CL12
16281,25,"“You’ll pay for that, you thief!” he bellowed.",CO157CL12
16282,26,"He rumbled on in this manner for quite some time. At eleven o’clock he fell asleep. While he slept, I pulled from my pocket an old translation of a d’Arlincourt novel which I had happened to find lying about. I sat down in his room to read it, a short distance from the bed, since I would have to wake the colonel at midnight to give him his medicine. Whether it was the effects of tiredness or the book itself, before I had reached the end of the second page, I, too, fell asleep.",CO157CL12
16283,27,"The colonel’s shouts woke me with a start and I sprang to my feet, still half asleep. He seemed delirious and kept on shouting, finally flinging the water jug at me. There was no time to duck; the jug caught me hard on the left cheek. Blinded by pain, I lunged at the invalid and grabbed him by the throat; we struggled, and I strangled him.",CO157CL12
16284,28,"When I realized he had stopped breathing, I stepped back in alarm and cried out, but no one heard me. I shook him then, trying to bring him back to life, but it was too late; the aneurism must have burst, and the colonel was dead. I went into the adjoining room and for two hours did not dare return to the bedroom. I cannot even begin to describe what went through my mind during that time. I was in a complete daze, a kind of vague, vacant delirium.",CO157CL12
16285,29,"It seemed to me that the walls had faces, and I could hear muffled voices. The victim’s cries, both before and during the struggle, continued to reverberate inside me, and whichever way I turned, the air seemed to shake with convulsions. Do not imagine that I’m simply making up colorful imagery for mere stylistic effect; I am telling you that I distinctly heard several voices crying: “Murderer! Murderer!”",CO157CL12
16286,30,"Otherwise, the house was silent. The slow, staccato tick tick of the clock only emphasized the silence and solitude. I put my ear to the bedroom door hoping to hear a groan, a word, an insult, anything that would indicate that he was alive and restore some peace to my conscience. I would have willingly taken ten, twenty, a hundred blows from the colonel’s fists. But nothing, absolutely nothing; all was silent. I began to pace the room once again; I sat down, my head in my hands, wishing I had never come to this place.",CO157CL12
16287,31,"“Damn and blast their wretched job!” I exclaimed. And I cursed the priest from Niterói, the doctor, the local priest, everyone who had gotten me the job and begged me to stay just a little longer. I clung to their complicity.",CO157CL12
16288,32,"When I began to find the silence too terrifying, I opened a window in the hope of hearing the sound of the wind, but there was no wind. The night was utterly still and the stars shone with the indifference of those who remove their hats when a funeral passes by but carry on with their conversation. I leaned out of the window for some time, staring into the darkness, mentally reviewing my life in the hope that this might ease my present anguish.",CO157CL12
16289,33,"Only then can I say that I thought clearly about my possible punishment. A heinous crime weighed upon me and certain retribution awaited. At this point, fear was added to my feelings of remorse. I felt my hair stand on end. A few minutes later, I saw three or four human shapes peering in at me from yard, as if ready to pounce; I stepped back into the room, the shapes vanished into thin air; it was a hallucination.",CO157CL12
16290,34,"Before day broke, I carefully cleaned the wound on my cheek. Only then did I dare return to the bedroom. Twice I drew back, but, finally, there was no avoiding it and I went in; even then I couldn’t go near the bed. My legs shook, my heart pounded; I considered fleeing the scene, but that would be tantamount to confessing my guilt, when what I urgently needed to do was to remove all traces of it. I went over to the bed and looked at the corpse, at its staring eyes and open mouth, as if it were uttering those eternal, centuries-old words: “Cain, what hast thou done with thy brother?”",CO157CL12
16291,35,"I saw the marks of my fingernails on his neck; I buttoned his nightshirt as high as I could and drew the sheet up to his chin. Then I called one of the slaves, told him the colonel had died in the night, and sent word to the local priest and the doctor.",CO157CL12
16292,36,"My first thought was to leave immediately, on the pretext that my brother was ill, for I had indeed received a letter from him a few days earlier saying he was not feeling well. But I realized that such a sudden departure might arouse suspicions, and so I stayed. I laid out the body myself, with the help of a shortsighted old Negro.",CO157CL12
16293,37,"I sat with the body, afraid others might notice something. I wanted to scrutinize their faces for some flicker of suspicion, and yet I dared not look at anyone. Everything made me jittery: the quiet footsteps stealing into the room, the whispers, the priest’s rituals and mumbled prayers. When the time came to close the coffin, my hands trembled so much that someone commented pityingly to their neighbor:",CO157CL12
16294,38,"“Poor Procópio! See how moved he is, despite all he had to put up with.”",CO157CL12
16295,39,"Fearing this might be an ironic remark, I was desperate to get it all over with. We moved outside. Passing from the half darkness of the house into the bright light of the street terrified me, convinced now that my crime would be impossible to hide. I fixed my eyes on the ground and kept walking. When it was all over, I breathed a sigh of relief. I was at peace with my fellow men, if not with my conscience; the next few nights were naturally ones of anxiety and affliction. I need hardly say that I came straight back to Rio de Janeiro and that I lived here in terror, even though I was far removed from the scene of the crime. I never laughed and barely spoke; I ate badly and suffered from hallucinations and nightmares . . .",CO157CL12
16296,40,"“Let the dead rest in peace,” people would say to me. “There’s no reason to be so upset.”",CO157CL12
16297,41,"And I took full advantage of this illusion, singing the praises of the dead man, calling him a fine old fellow, a little rough around the edges, perhaps, but with a heart of gold. And as I praised him, I almost persuaded myself that this was true, at least for a few moments. Another interesting aspect, which may be of some interest to you, is that, although I wasn’t a religious man, I had a mass said for the eternal rest of the colonel’s soul, at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament.",CO157CL12
16298,42,"I didn’t send out any invitations, or mention it to anyone; I went to hear it alone, kneeling throughout and crossing myself many times. I paid the priest double the usual amount and distributed alms at the door of the church, all in the name of the deceased. I wasn’t trying to deceive anyone, the proof being that I went to the mass alone. I should also add that I never mentioned the colonel without saying, “God rest his soul!” And then I would tell a couple of lighthearted anecdotes about him and some of his more amusing outbursts.",CO157CL12
16299,43,"Seven days after arriving in Rio de Janeiro, I received the letter from the priest that I showed you, telling me they’d found the colonel’s will and that I was his sole heir. You can imagine my astonishment. I thought I had misread the letter; I showed it to my brother and some friends; they all interpreted it in exactly the same way.",CO157CL12
16300,44,"It was there in writing: I was the colonel’s sole heir. I even wondered if it was a trap, but quickly realized that there were other means of ensnaring me if the crime had been discovered. Furthermore, I knew the priest to be an honest man and a most unlikely instrument for such a scheme. I reread the letter countless times; there it was in black and white.",CO157CL12

Ask me, on the other hand, for my dead man’s shoes, and they will be yours and yours alone.",CO157CL10
16324,5,"As you know, these events took place in 1860. Sometime around August of the preceding year, when I was forty-two, I became a theologian—or rather, I began copying out theological tracts for a priest in Niterói, an old friend from school, who thereby tactfully provided me with room and board. During that month of August 1859, he received a letter from a fellow priest in a certain provincial town, who asked him if he knew of a discreet, intelligent, patient fellow who would be willing to go and serve as gentleman’s companion to a Colonel Felisberto, in return for a decent wage. My friend duly consulted me, and I gladly accepted, for I was already becoming fed up with copying out Latin quotations and ecclesiastical formulas. I returned to Rio to say goodbye to a brother of mine, then set off for the provinces.",CO157CL10
16325,6,"When I arrived in the town, I heard dire reports about the colonel. He was, it seemed, a quite unbearable man, eccentric and demanding; no one, it was said, could stand him, not even his friends. He had been through more gentleman’s companions than medicines. Indeed, he had punched two of them in the face. I replied that I was not afraid of healthy folk, still less of the sick; and after discussing matters with the priest, who confirmed what I had heard and recommended an attitude of meekness and loving charity, I proceeded to the colonel’s residence.",CO157CL10
16326,7,"I found him stretched out in a chair on the veranda, breathing heavily. He did not receive me badly; at first he said nothing and merely fixed me with his eyes like a watchful cat. Then a malevolent smile spread across his harsh features. Finally, he told me that none of his previous gentleman’s companions had been any use at all—always sleeping, answering back, chasing after the female slaves. Two of them had been downright thieves!",CO157CL10

16328,9,"“No, sir.”",CO157CL10
16329,10,"Then he asked me my name. I told him and he looked startled. Colombo? No, sir: Procópio José Gomes Valongo. Valongo? He thought this a preposterous name and proposed calling me just plain Procópio, to which I replied that he could call me whatever he pleased.",CO157CL10
16330,11,"I’m telling you this detail not just because I think it gives you an idea of what he was like, but also because my reply made a very favorable impression on the colonel. He himself said so to the priest, adding that I was the most agreeable of all the gentleman’s companions he’d had. The honeymoon lasted for seven days.",CO157CL10
16331,12,"On the eighth day, my life became exactly the same as that of my predecessors. It was a dog’s life, with no sleep, no thoughts of my own, and being constantly showered with insults, which, at times, I laughed at with an air of resignation and deference, for I had noticed that this was one way of mollifying him.",CO157CL10
16332,13,"His rudeness stemmed as much from his illness as from his temperament, for he suffered from a litany of complaints: an aneurism, rheumatism, and three or four lesser afflictions. He was nearly sixty, and from the age of five everyone had indulged his every whim. Had he been merely grumpy, that would have been fine; but he had a mean streak in him, and took pleasure in the pain and humiliation of others. At the end of three months I’d had enough and decided to leave; I waited only for the right opportunity.",CO157CL10
16333,14,"It wasn’t long in coming. One day, when I failed to give him his embrocation at the correct time, he grabbed his stick and struck me two or three times. That was the last straw; I quit there and then and went to pack my bags. Later, he came to my room and begged me to stay, saying that there was no need to take offense at an old man’s bad temper. He was so insistent that I stayed.",CO157CL10
16334,15,"“I’m in a terrible pickle, Procópio,” he told me that night. “I won’t live much longer. One foot in the grave, you might say. But you must go to my funeral, Procópio; I absolutely insist. You must go, and you must pray at my graveside. If you don’t,” he added with a chuckle, “I’ll come back at night and torment you. Do you believe in spirits from the other world, Procópio?”",CO157CL10
16335,16,“Certainly not!”,CO157CL10
16336,17,"“Why wouldn’t you believe, you donkey?” he retorted excitedly, opening his eyes very wide.",CO157CL10
16337,18,"If these were the truces, just imagine the wars! He stopped hitting me with the stick, but the insults were just as bad, if not worse. With time I became inured to them and stopped noticing; I was an ass, a dolt, an idiot, a good-for-nothing lazybones, everything under the sun. There wasn’t even anyone to share these insults with me.",CO157CL10
16338,19,"He had no relatives; there had been a nephew up in Minas Gerais, but he had died of consumption sometime between the end of May and the beginning of July. His friends came by occasionally to flatter and indulge him; a five- or ten-minute visit, nothing more. So there was no one but me, just me, for an entire dictionary of expletives. More than once I resolved to leave, but each time, at the priest’s insistence, I ended up staying.",CO157CL10
16339,20,"Not only were relations between us becoming increasingly strained, I was also keen to return to Rio. At forty-two I wasn’t yet ready to become a complete recluse tending to a petulant old invalid in the back of beyond. To get an idea of my isolation, suffice it to say that I didn’t even read the newspapers; apart from the odd piece of news that reached the colonel, I was totally cut off from the rest of the world.",CO157CL10
16340,21,"I therefore decided to return to the capital at the first opportunity, even if it meant crossing swords with the local priest. Seeing as I’m making a general confession, I should perhaps add that, since I was spending nothing and saving up all of my wages, I was eager to come and squander them here in the city.",CO157CL10
16341,22,"Such an opportunity seemed imminent. The colonel’s health was steadily deteriorating and he had drawn up his will, managing to offend the notary almost as much as he had me.",CO157CL10
16342,23,"His manners became ever coarser, and the brief lapses of peace and affability were now rare. I had already lost the meager dose of pity that had made me overlook the sick man’s excesses; inside, I was seething with hatred and revulsion. At the beginning of August, I resolved definitively to go; the priest and the doctor, while accepting my reasons, asked me to stay just a little longer. I granted them one month; at the end of the month I would leave, no matter what the patient’s condition. The priest took it upon himself to find my replacement.",CO157CL10
16343,24,"Now here comes the event itself. On the evening of the twenty-fourth of August, the colonel fell into a fit of rage and knocked me down, calling me all sorts of vile names, threatening to shoot me, even ending up by throwing a bowl of porridge at me because he said it had gone cold. The bowl hit the wall and shattered into pieces.",CO157CL10
16344,25,"“You’ll pay for that, you thief!” he bellowed.",CO157CL10
16345,26,"He rumbled on in this manner for quite some time. At eleven o’clock he fell asleep. While he slept, I pulled from my pocket an old translation of a d’Arlincourt novel which I had happened to find lying about. I sat down in his room to read it, a short distance from the bed, since I would have to wake the colonel at midnight to give him his medicine. Whether it was the effects of tiredness or the book itself, before I had reached the end of the second page, I, too, fell asleep.",CO157CL10
16346,27,"The colonel’s shouts woke me with a start and I sprang to my feet, still half asleep. He seemed delirious and kept on shouting, finally flinging the water jug at me. There was no time to duck; the jug caught me hard on the left cheek. Blinded by pain, I lunged at the invalid and grabbed him by the throat; we struggled, and I strangled him.",CO157CL10
16347,28,"When I realized he had stopped breathing, I stepped back in alarm and cried out, but no one heard me. I shook him then, trying to bring him back to life, but it was too late; the aneurism must have burst, and the colonel was dead. I went into the adjoining room and for two hours did not dare return to the bedroom. I cannot even begin to describe what went through my mind during that time. I was in a complete daze, a kind of vague, vacant delirium.",CO157CL10
16348,29,"It seemed to me that the walls had faces, and I could hear muffled voices. The victim’s cries, both before and during the struggle, continued to reverberate inside me, and whichever way I turned, the air seemed to shake with convulsions. Do not imagine that I’m simply making up colorful imagery for mere stylistic effect; I am telling you that I distinctly heard several voices crying: “Murderer! Murderer!”",CO157CL10
16349,30,"Otherwise, the house was silent. The slow, staccato tick tick of the clock only emphasized the silence and solitude. I put my ear to the bedroom door hoping to hear a groan, a word, an insult, anything that would indicate that he was alive and restore some peace to my conscience. I would have willingly taken ten, twenty, a hundred blows from the colonel’s fists. But nothing, absolutely nothing; all was silent. I began to pace the room once again; I sat down, my head in my hands, wishing I had never come to this place.",CO157CL10
16350,31,"“Damn and blast their wretched job!” I exclaimed. And I cursed the priest from Niterói, the doctor, the local priest, everyone who had gotten me the job and begged me to stay just a little longer. I clung to their complicity.",CO157CL10
16351,32,"When I began to find the silence too terrifying, I opened a window in the hope of hearing the sound of the wind, but there was no wind. The night was utterly still and the stars shone with the indifference of those who remove their hats when a funeral passes by but carry on with their conversation. I leaned out of the window for some time, staring into the darkness, mentally reviewing my life in the hope that this might ease my present anguish.",CO157CL10
16352,33,"Only then can I say that I thought clearly about my possible punishment. A heinous crime weighed upon me and certain retribution awaited. At this point, fear was added to my feelings of remorse. I felt my hair stand on end. A few minutes later, I saw three or four human shapes peering in at me from yard, as if ready to pounce; I stepped back into the room, the shapes vanished into thin air; it was a hallucination.",CO157CL10
16353,34,"Before day broke, I carefully cleaned the wound on my cheek. Only then did I dare return to the bedroom. Twice I drew back, but, finally, there was no avoiding it and I went in; even then I couldn’t go near the bed. My legs shook, my heart pounded; I considered fleeing the scene, but that would be tantamount to confessing my guilt, when what I urgently needed to do was to remove all traces of it. I went over to the bed and looked at the corpse, at its staring eyes and open mouth, as if it were uttering those eternal, centuries-old words: “Cain, what hast thou done with thy brother?”",CO157CL10
16354,35,"I saw the marks of my fingernails on his neck; I buttoned his nightshirt as high as I could and drew the sheet up to his chin. Then I called one of the slaves, told him the colonel had died in the night, and sent word to the local priest and the doctor.",CO157CL10
16355,36,"My first thought was to leave immediately, on the pretext that my brother was ill, for I had indeed received a letter from him a few days earlier saying he was not feeling well. But I realized that such a sudden departure might arouse suspicions, and so I stayed. I laid out the body myself, with the help of a shortsighted old Negro.",CO157CL10
16356,37,"I sat with the body, afraid others might notice something. I wanted to scrutinize their faces for some flicker of suspicion, and yet I dared not look at anyone. Everything made me jittery: the quiet footsteps stealing into the room, the whispers, the priest’s rituals and mumbled prayers. When the time came to close the coffin, my hands trembled so much that someone commented pityingly to their neighbor:",CO157CL10
16357,38,"“Poor Procópio! See how moved he is, despite all he had to put up with.”",CO157CL10
16358,39,"Fearing this might be an ironic remark, I was desperate to get it all over with. We moved outside. Passing from the half darkness of the house into the bright light of the street terrified me, convinced now that my crime would be impossible to hide. I fixed my eyes on the ground and kept walking. When it was all over, I breathed a sigh of relief. I was at peace with my fellow men, if not with my conscience; the next few nights were naturally ones of anxiety and affliction. I need hardly say that I came straight back to Rio de Janeiro and that I lived here in terror, even though I was far removed from the scene of the crime. I never laughed and barely spoke; I ate badly and suffered from hallucinations and nightmares . . .",CO157CL10
16359,40,"“Let the dead rest in peace,” people would say to me. “There’s no reason to be so upset.”",CO157CL10
16360,41,"And I took full advantage of this illusion, singing the praises of the dead man, calling him a fine old fellow, a little rough around the edges, perhaps, but with a heart of gold. And as I praised him, I almost persuaded myself that this was true, at least for a few moments. Another interesting aspect, which may be of some interest to you, is that, although I wasn’t a religious man, I had a mass said for the eternal rest of the colonel’s soul, at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament.",CO157CL10
16361,42,"I didn’t send out any invitations, or mention it to anyone; I went to hear it alone, kneeling throughout and crossing myself many times. I paid the priest double the usual amount and distributed alms at the door of the church, all in the name of the deceased. I wasn’t trying to deceive anyone, the proof being that I went to the mass alone. I should also add that I never mentioned the colonel without saying, “God rest his soul!” And then I would tell a couple of lighthearted anecdotes about him and some of his more amusing outbursts.",CO157CL10
16362,43,"Seven days after arriving in Rio de Janeiro, I received the letter from the priest that I showed you, telling me they’d found the colonel’s will and that I was his sole heir. You can imagine my astonishment. I thought I had misread the letter; I showed it to my brother and some friends; they all interpreted it in exactly the same way.",CO157CL10
16363,44,"It was there in writing: I was the colonel’s sole heir. I even wondered if it was a trap, but quickly realized that there were other means of ensnaring me if the crime had been discovered. Furthermore, I knew the priest to be an honest man and a most unlikely instrument for such a scheme. I reread the letter countless times; there it was in black and white.",CO157CL10

At first, he didn’t buy many tickets, but little by little age, and then solitude, aggravated that habit and caused him not to let a lottery go by without buying a ticket.",CO215CL08
16388,6,"Initially, not seeing any winnings, he promised to stop buying tickets, and for a time he kept his promise. But then someone who would urge him to choose a nice number would turn up and he would buy the number and hope. Thus he went through time until at one point lotteries became synonymous with days and he started buying six tickets a week; Sundays he rested. The notary, one Amaral, who is still alive, was the tempting archfiend in his breakdowns. No sooner than he discovered the clerk’s addiction than he started to encourage it, telling him thrilling stories of people who got rich from one moment to the next.",CO215CL08
16389,7,"“One fellow was this way, another fellow that way,” Amaral would say to him, recounting each one’s great good luck.",CO215CL08
16390,8,"Coimbra listened and believed. By now he was giving in to the thousand ways of bringing on luck that superstition can lend certainty to: the number of some deeds, the amount of some expenses, a chance arrangement of numerals—everything was a combination for ordering tickets, buying them, and hoping. For the first lottery of every year he would buy the number of the year; he used this method as of 1884.",CO215CL08
16391,9,"For the last lottery of 1892 he came up with another method; he reversed the digits from right to left and bought the number 2981. Even then he didn’t get tired of it for two fundamental reasons and one accidental one. You already know about the first two, necessity and habit; the third one is that fortune was nicely enticing. Not all of his tickets came up empty. Sometimes (deliberately, it seemed), Coimbra would say about a ticket that it was the last and that if it came up empty he would never buy another; the wheel would turn, he would win five or a hundred or twenty mil-réis or even the same money he had paid.",CO215CL08
16392,10,"It meant that he could also win the jackpot; in any event, that money allowed him to buy some lottery tickets for nothing. “Buying for nothing” was the very expression he used. One time, the jackpot went to a ticket two numbers ahead of his, 7377; his was 7375. The clerk was reborn.",CO215CL08
16393,11,"Thus he went through the final years of the empire and the first ones of the republic no longer believing in either of the regimes. He didn’t believe in anything. Not even justice, inasmuch as it was official, earned his faith; it struck him as an institution created to resolve or perpetuate human disputes, but in varied and contradictory ways, now with one approach, now with another.",CO215CL08
16394,12,"As he was not familiar with the Ordinances of the Kingdom, except by name, or with imperial and republican laws, he believed religiously that they counted for as much in the mouths of authors as they did in those of criminals—that is to say, that they formed a repository of conflicting rules applicable to all situations and claims. Don’t attribute any elegant skepticism to him; he wasn’t of that breed that tempers its disbelief in men and in things with a subtle and benevolent smile. No, in him disbelief was like a bedraggled cloak.",CO215CL08
16395,13,"Only once did he leave Rio de Janeiro; it was to go to Espírito Santo in search of some diamonds he didn’t find. There are some who said that it was that adventure that gave him his taste for and faith in the lottery; nor was there any shortage of those who suggested the opposite—that his faith in the lottery is what had given him a premature vision of the diamonds. Both explanations are possible. Also possible is a third explanation, some inducement common to diamonds and prizes.",CO215CL08
16396,14,"The human soul is so subtle and complicated that it sows evident confusion in its outward actions. Regardless, he left Rio de Janeiro that time only. Most of the time, he lived in this city, where he grew old and died. The Saint Bernard confraternity took it on itself to give him give him a tomb—not that he lacked the means for one, as we shall see—out of a kind of moral obligation to its founder.",CO215CL08
16397,15,"He died during the Campos Sales presidency, in early April 1899. He had just been to the notary Amaral’s wedding, as a witness, when he was overcome by heart failure, and before midnight he had breathed his last. All of the advice that was found in his will can be summarized in this word: persist. Amaral had the document transcribed for the use and edification of his son, who was five years old and was starting school. He did so sincerely, and not without sadness, as Coimbra’s death always struck him as a result of his bad luck; it had left no time for any fond recollection of his old friend, witness to his marriage and likely godfather to his son.",CO215CL08
16398,16,"Before the blow that did him in, Coimbra suffered no ailment, had not the slightest injury, just a bit of fatigue. All of his organs were in good shape, and even his brain, though never anything tremendous, was not anything less than before. Perhaps his memory had gotten a bit weaker, but he consoled himself for the weakness by saying that “a lot of wretched things were leaving his head as he started losing his memory.” In judicial offices he was well liked and in the registry office he was respected. In 1897, for Saint John’s Day, the notary Amaral mentioned the benefits of resting to him and offered to take over the registry office to follow his friend’s “stirring example.” Coimbra, offering thanks, refused. In the meantime, he kept fearing that he might lose his strength and fall completely apart, with no more body and soul to give to his trade. Now, evenings, he no longer left the office without a glance of precursory longing.",CO215CL08
16399,17,"It was Christmas of 1898. As of the first of December, tickets were being sold for the big drawing for five hundred contos, called the monster in some moneychangers’ advertisements. Coimbra bought one. This time, he apparently didn’t go for any combination of numerals; he chose his ticket from among those he was shown at the counter. At home, he put it in a desk drawer and waited.",CO215CL08
16400,18,"“This time, yes,” he said to the notary Amaral the next day; “this time I’m going to stop trying my luck. If I don’t get anything, I’m going to quit buying lottery tickets.”",CO215CL08
16401,19,"Amaral was about to endorse the resolution, but a contrary thought stopped him short before he could get a word out, and instead of an assertion he made an inquiry. Why quit for good? The lottery is a woman—she might end up giving in one day.",CO215CL08
16402,20,"“I’m no longer of the age to hope,” replied the clerk.",CO215CL08
16403,21,"“Hope has no age,” pronounced Amaral, recalling some lines of verse he had once written before concluding with a variant on the old adage: “Good things come to those who hope.”",CO215CL08
16404,22,"“Well, I won’t hope and I won’t get good things,” insisted the clerk. “This ticket is the last one.”",CO215CL08
16405,23,"Since he had made the same declaration many times before, it was likely that now, too, he would forget the declaration and, defeated on Christmas Day, try his luck again on Three Kings’ Day. It was what Amaral thought, and he didn’t insist on persuading him of a vice that was in his blood. In fact, though, Coimbra was sincere. He considered that temptation his last. He didn’t think of the possibility of winning, as before, some fifty or one hundred mil-réis, a miniscule amount in view of his ambitions, but enough to get him to backslide. His heart was set on the two extremes: nothing or five hundred contos. If it were nothing, it was the end. He would do as he had done with the confraternity and religion; he would kick the habit, stop being a regular, and go listen to the devil’s mass.",CO215CL08
16406,24,"The days started going by, as they tend to, with, as always, their twenty-four hours, in the same order, with the same succession of light and darkness, work and rest. The clerk’s soul was attuned to the twenty-fourth, Christmas Eve, when the wheel would turn, and he went on with the transcriptions of and attachments and conclusions to his trial proceedings. It’s worth nothing, to this man’s credit, that no extraneous concern detracted from the joys he took from his clerkship, no matter how much he might have preferred riches to work.",CO215CL08
16407,25,"Only when day dawned on the twentieth and shortened the interval to the fateful day did the image of the five hundred contos interfere with the papers from the courts. But it wasn’t just the greater proximity that had this effect—it was also conversations about big lottery prizes in the street and even in the office, and, more than the conversations, the very figure of a man who had won one of them five years earlier. Coimbra had received one Guimarães, executor of a shoe importer’s will, who turned up to sign a statement. As the statement was being drafted, someone who was with him asked him if he was “taking his chances in the Christmas lottery.”",CO215CL08
16408,26,"“No,” said Guimarães.",CO215CL08
16409,27,"“You’re not always going to get lucky, either.”",CO215CL08
16410,28,"Coimbra didn’t have time to ask any questions; the executor’s friend told him that in 1893, he had won two hundred contos. Coimbra looked at the executor in astonishment. He was the one, he was the very man, he was someone who through a small payment and a numbered ticket had taken possession of two hundred contos de réis. Coimbra took a good luck at the man. He was a man, a fortunate man.",CO215CL08
16411,29,“Two hundred contos?” he said to hear confirmation from the man himself.,CO215CL08
16412,30,"“Two hundred contos,” Guimarães said again. “It wasn’t an effort or a wish on my part,” he explained. “I didn’t usually play, and that time I just about tore into the kid who was trying to sell me the ticket. He was an Italian. ‘Guardate, signore,’ he begged, sticking the ticket in my face. Tired of scolding, I went into the hall and bought the ticket. Three days later I had the money in my hand. Two hundred contos.”",CO215CL08
16413,31,"The clerk made no mistakes on the statement because his fingers themselves were clerks; in fact, he was thinking only of decorating that man, reproducing him in his memory, examining him, shouting to him that he, too, had a ticket for the five hundred contos of the twenty-fourth and demanding that he give him the secret to winning. Guimarães signed the statement and left; Coimbra felt an urge to run after him, to feel him, to see if he was really human, if he was flesh, if he was blood. . . . It was true, then? There were prizes? Big prizes were awarded? And the serenity that fellow told the story of the purchase with! He, too, would be that way if he got two hundred contos, much less five hundred.",CO215CL08
16414,32,"Those snippets convey somewhat vaguely the clerk’s muddled thoughts. Until now he had had faith, though reduced to habit alone now, long and deeply rooted habit lacking either miracles or wonderment. Now he was seeing a man who had gone from nothing to two hundred contos with a mere gesture of annoyance. He was someone who didn’t even have the lottery itch; on the contrary, he just about tore into Fortune; she, however, with a lover’s gaze, had him turn his impatience into acquiescence, pay her five or ten mil-réis, and three days later. . . . Coimbra did all the rest of the day’s work mechanically.",CO215CL08
16415,33,"That evening, walking home, the conviction that the five hundred contos was his started worming into his soul. It was more than the other fellow’s, but he deserved more, too, persisting as he had for long, barren, and empty years meagerly sprinkled with a rare few hundred mil-réis. He had more of a right than the other man, perhaps more than anybody. He had dinner, went to the house next door, where, for fear of not winning anything and getting laughed at, he said nothing. He fell asleep and dreamed about the ticket and the prize; it was the moneychanger himself who gave him the news of his win; that morning, he didn’t remember clearly if it was the moneychanger who had sought him out or if he had sought out the moneychanger; he did remember the banknotes, which were apparently big, green, and cool. On thinking about them he felt his hands again. Pure illusion!",CO215CL08
16416,34,"Illusion notwithstanding, the gentleness of sleep had left the coolness, the green, and the heft of the contos in his hands. As he went by the Bank of the Republic, he thought he would put the money there sooner than use it on real estate, stocks, and other goods. That day, the twenty-first, meant worse cravings than on the twentieth. Coimbra was so nervous that he found work excessive, when he was ordinarily happy in the midst of papers. He felt a bit better that afternoon, but on leaving, he heard children selling lottery tickets, and this language, shouted from a large stand, troubled his soul anew.",CO215CL08
16417,35,"As he went by the church where the image of Saint Bernard, whose confraternity he had founded, was venerated, Coimbra turned a yearning gaze on the past. Those days in which he had been a believer! In the past, he would have made a vow to the saint; now. . . .",CO215CL08
16418,36,"“Unfortunately, not,” he sighed to himself.",CO215CL08
16419,37,"He shook his head and made his way home. As he was eating dinner, the image of the saint, with a seraphic gaze and an attitude of undying beatitude, came two or three times to take a peep at him. The poor clerk was being beset now by this annoyance, this other arid and greater wasteland. He did not believe; he was without sweet religious faith, he told himself. He went for a walk that night and to take a shortcut he turned into an alley.",CO215CL08
16420,38,"As he was leaving the alley, he had the impression someone was calling him; he looked back and saw the person of the saint, now more celestial. It was no longer the wooden image; it was the person, as I say, the living person of the great Christian abbot. The illusion was so complete that it seemed to him he was seeing the saint reach out to him with the banknotes from his dream, those big and cool banknotes, in his hand.",CO215CL08
16421,39,"Imagine that night of the twenty-first and the morning of the twenty-second. He couldn’t help but go by the church of the confraternity and go back into it on the way to the registry office. What he told himself was that it was to see if the local people were treating his institution with the same devotion as before. He came across the sacristan, a devout old man who advanced toward him with his soul in his gaze.",CO215CL08
16422,40,“You here!” he cried out.,CO215CL08
16423,41,"“Yes, indeed. I was going by; it occurred to me to see how my guest was being treated here.”",CO215CL08
16424,42,"“What guest?” asked the sacristan, not understanding the figurative language.",CO215CL08
16425,43,“My old Saint Bernard.”,CO215CL08
16426,44,“Ah! Saint Bernard! How is a miraculous saint like him going to be treated? Did you come to the feast this year?”,CO215CL08
16427,45,“I couldn’t.”,CO215CL08
16428,46,"“Well, it was very nice. People gave a lot of alms and there was a big crowd. The officers were reelected, you know?”",CO215CL08
16429,47,"Coimbra didn’t know, but he said he did, and he thought sincerely that he should have known; he called himself careless, lazy, and turned on the image a gaze that he imagined contrite and that may well have been. To the sacristan it looked devout. He, too, raised his eyes to the image and made the usual bow, tilting half of his body and bending at the knee. Coimbra didn’t go so far, but he imitated the gesture.",CO215CL08
16430,48,"“The school is going well, you know?” said the sacristan.",CO215CL08
16431,49,"“The school? Ah, yes! It’s still around?”",CO215CL08
16432,50,“Still around? It has seventy-nine students.”,CO215CL08
16433,51,"It was a school that the confraternity had founded, and given the saint’s name, Saint Bernard’s School, when the clerk’s wife was still alive. The clerk’s indifference to religion had reached the point that, almost forgetting it entirely, he hadn’t kept up with the prosperity of the establishment. On hearing the news, he was amazed. In his day, there were no more than a dozen students; now there were seventy-nine. Through a few questions about the administration, he learned that the brotherhood was paying a headmaster and three teachers. At year’s end there was going to be a prize ceremony, a big celebration the archbishop was expected to attend.",CO215CL08
16434,52,"When he left the church, Coimbra was in the grips of heaven knows what vague and gray resurgence. In fact, it was colorless, but the expression suggests a trait neither alive, as before, nor entirely dead. The heart is not cradle and grave alone—it is also a hospital. It offers protection to a patient who one day, without knowing how, recovers, shakes off his paralysis, and leaps up. In Coimbra’s heart the patient didn’t leap up—he started moving his fingers and his lips with such signs of life that they seemed to be beckoning the clerk and telling him things from another time.",CO215CL08
16435,53,“Last chance! Five hundred contos!” shouted the boys as he was about to go into the registry office. “Five hundred contos! Last chance!”,CO215CL08
16436,54,"These voices went in with him and were heard again several times over the course of the day, either from other hawkers or from the ones he himself had heard. When he went back home, he went by the church again but didn’t go in; a devil, or what have you, headed off the move he started to make.",CO215CL08
16437,55,"He was no less anxious the twenty-third. Coimbra remembered to go by Saint Bernard’s; the school was no longer in the old house, but in another, a good, two-story house with seven windows, an iron gateway, and a garden. How is it that he could have been one of the initial creators of such a notable institution? He went by it twice, even wanted to go in, but he didn’t know what he would say to the headmaster and he feared the laughter of the schoolchildren. He headed for the registry office, and on the way memory after memory took him back to the days when he was learning to read.",CO215CL08
16438,56,"He, too, went to school, after all, and making promises to pray to the saints got him out of many a paddling. One day, at home, threatened with a beating for having pilfered a sweet—disgusting, for the rest—from his father, he promised Our Lady a wax candle. His mother prayed for him, and managed to get him forgiven; he asked his mother for the money for the candle and kept his promise. Old and charming reminiscences that alleviated the uninspiring drafting of papers. When he was an active brother and officer, he had made more than one promise to Saint Bernard himself, and he had kept them all. Where had those days gone?",CO215CL08
16439,57,"Finally, it was the morning of the twenty-fourth of December. The wheel was going to turn at midday. Coimbra woke earlier than usual; it was just starting to get light. Although he knew the number of the ticket by heart, he wrote it down on a sheet of note paper to make sure he would have it in case he won the jackpot. . . .",CO215CL08
16440,58,"That thought made him shudder. A last hope (which a man of faith never loses) asked him wordlessly: what is it that’s preventing him from winning the five hundred contos? Five hundred contos! Such things did he see in this amount that he closed his dazzled eyes. The air, like an echo, repeated: five hundred contos! And his hands felt the same amount.",CO215CL08
16441,59,"On his way, he went to the church, which he found open and deserted. No, it wasn’t deserted. An old black woman, on her knees before the altar to Saint Bernard, with a rosary in hand, seemed to be asking him for something, if she wasn’t paying back in prayers the benefaction she had already received. Coimbra saw her position and her attitude. It occurred to him that he was behind the consolation granted that devout woman and he, too, looked at the image. It was the same as in his day. The woman ended up kissing the cross from her rosary; she crossed herself, stood up, and left.",CO215CL08
16442,60,"He was going to leave, too, when two things went through his head: the prize, of course, and the school. After them came a suggestion, then a calculation. This calculation, however much we may say the clerk loved money (and he did), was disinterested; it was to give a lot of himself, to contribute more and more to the growth of the school, which was in part his work. He promised to give one hundred contos de réis for education, for schooling, for Saint Bernard’s School, if he won the lottery.",CO215CL08
16443,61,"He made the promise not in so many words, but in these terms, not written down, but no less sincere for all that: “I promise to give Saint Bernard’s School one hundred contos de réis if I win the lottery.” Back outside, it struck him that he wouldn’t lose anything if he didn’t win the lottery and that he would win four hundred contos if he did. He sped up and entered the registry office once again, where he tried to immerse himself in work.",CO215CL08
16444,62,"The agonies of that twenty-fourth of December of 1898 cannot be told. Let someone who has once expected five hundred contos de réis imagine them. Yet he didn’t stop receiving and counting the amounts he was owed for legal documents. Between eleven o’clock and twelve noon, after the opening lines of a document and before a conclusion, he apparently again made the promise of a hundred contos for the school: “I promise to give, etc.”",CO215CL08
16445,63,"The clock struck twelve, and Coimbra’s heart, joining in, pounded, with the difference that the twelve strokes of the clock of São Francisco de Paula were what they have always been since clocks were invented—a sure, steady, and perfected action—and the beating of that man’s heart was rapid, spasmodic, irregular, unending. When he heard the final stroke, he couldn’t help thinking more intensely about the wheel or about whatever it was that was going to draw the numbers and the lottery prizes. It was now. . . . He thought about going out to get news, but he hesitated. It’s hard to imagine such impatience in an old gambler. He was apparently sensing what was going to happen to him.",CO215CL08
16446,64,"Do you doubt what happened to him? At half past four, his work done, he left with his soul in his legs and ran to the closest lottery establishment. There, written in chalk on a blackboard, were the number of his ticket and the five hundred contos. He may have had his soul in his legs, but it must have been made of lead, because they stopped working, and light didn’t come back into his eyes until a few minutes later, either. Once he had come to, he checked his wallet—it was that very number. Even so, he could have made a mistake on copying it. He flew home in a tilbury; he hadn’t made a mistake. It was his number.",CO215CL08
16447,65,"Everything was done with loyalty. Five days later, the officers of the confraternity received the one hundred contos de réis for Saint Bernard’s School, and they sent the founder of the two institutions an official letter of gratitude, delivered to him by a delegation of all of the officers.",CO215CL08

16470,22,"“So, anyway, my mother’s widowed sister, Aunt Marcolina, whose husband had been Captain Peçanha of the National Guard, and who lived by herself on a remote, solitary farm many leagues from town, sent word that I should go visit her for a few days and wear my uniform. I went, accompanied only by a servant who returned to town within a few days carrying a letter to my mother. Aunt Marcolina had written her to say that, having me in her clutches, she did not intend to let me leave for at least a month. She hugged me repeatedly, called me ‘her lieutenant,’ and said that I was a fine-looking young man. She joked that she was jealous of whomever I might marry.",CO111CL06

It was ‘lieutenant this,’ ‘lieutenant that,’ all the time ‘lieutenant.’ I asked her just to call me ‘João,’ as she always had before, but she shook her head, no sir, I was ‘mister lieutenant.’ An older man who was living there, Captain Peçanha’s brother, called me the same thing, not in jest, but seriously, and in front of the slaves, who were soon doing it, too.",CO111CL06
16472,24,"I occupied the place of honor at the head of the table, and I was the first one served at dinner. You have no idea. Aunt Marcolina even had a large looking glass moved into my bedroom, a beautiful, old mirror in a standing frame that contrasted with the other furnishings of the house, which were simple and modest. It was an heirloom, a gift from her godmother, who had inherited it from her mother, who had supposedly purchased it from a Portuguese noblewoman, one of the courtiers who came with King João to Brazil in 1808. That’s what they said in the family, at least. I don’t know how much is true. The looking glass was really old, of course, with the gold paint worn off the frame in places. It had dolphins and artistic ornaments sculpted at the upper corners, very nicely done and inlaid with mother of pearl. Old, but nice.”",CO111CL06

But there wasn’t a power on earth that could dissuade her from the idea. She said that she didn’t need it in the front room, that it was only for a few weeks, and finally that ‘the lieutenant’ deserved the looking glass and much, much more. The truth is that all the attention—the gifts, the honors, the affection—worked a transformation in me, a transformation that the natural feelings of youth encouraged and completed.

Once I got the idea of writing something, a newspaper editorial, a novel, an ode—I couldn’t make up my mind. I sat down and wrote a few random words and phrases to combine thematically, but the theme, like Aunt Marcolina, refused to materialize. Soeur Anne, soeur Anne … but no, nothing at all.

On the contrary, I attributed the phenomenon to my upset state, and then I did feel fear. If this situation lasted much longer, I could go mad. ‘I’m getting out of here,’ I said to myself.

16510,3,"LATE ONE NIGHT, four or five gentlemen were debating various lofty matters, and although they all had different views, there were no frayed tempers. The house was situated on the Santa Teresa hill overlooking Rio; the room was small and lit by candles, whose glow mingled mysteriously with the moonlight streaming in from outside. Between the bustle and excitement of the city below and the sky above, where the stars were shining in the still, clear air, sat our four or five metaphysical detectives, amicably resolving the universe’s knottiest problems.",CO111CL12
16511,4,"Four or five, I say, and yet, strictly speaking, only four of them spoke, but there was a fifth person in the room who sat in silence, thinking or dozing, and whose only contribution to the debate was an occasional grunt of approval. The man was the same age as his companions, i.e., between forty and fifty years old; he was from the provinces, wealthy, intelligent, not uneducated, and, it would seem, shrewd and somewhat caustic.",CO111CL12
16512,5,"He never participated in their discussions or arguments, and always justified his silence with a paradox, saying that discussion was simply the polite form of the latent warrior instinct man had inherited from beasts. He would add that the seraphim and cherubim never disagreed, and they were eternal, spiritual perfection. When he gave this same answer that night, one of the others took him up on it and challenged him to prove his assertion, if he could. Jacobina (for that was his name) thought for a moment, then replied:",CO111CL12
16513,6,"“All things considered, perhaps you’re right.”",CO111CL12
16514,7,"And suddenly, in the middle of the night, this taciturn fellow began to hold forth, not for two or three minutes, but for thirty or forty. The meandering conversation had come to rest upon the nature of the soul, a point that radically divided the four friends. No two minds thought alike; not only was there no agreement, discussion became difficult, not to say impossible, on account of the multiplicity of issues branching out from the main trunk of the debate, and perhaps also on account of the inconsistency of the various positions adopted. One of the participants asked Jacobina to offer an opinion, or, at the very least, a conjecture.",CO111CL12
16515,8,"“No conjecture and no opinion,” he replied. “Either one can lead to disagreement and, as you all know, I never engage in arguments. But if you will listen in silence, I can tell you about an episode in my life that demonstrates the issue in question in the clearest possible terms. To begin with, there is not one soul, but two—”",CO111CL12
16516,9,“Two?”,CO111CL12
16517,10,"“Yes, two. Every human creature contains two souls: one that looks from the inside out, and the other that looks from the outside in. Go on, gawk, stare, shrug your shoulders, whatever you like, but don’t say anything. If you try to argue, I’ll finish my cigar and go home to bed. Now, the external soul can be a spirit, a fluid, a man (or many men), an object, even an action. There are cases, for example, of a simple shirt button being a person’s external soul, or it could be the polka, a card game, a book, a machine, a pair of boots, a song, a drum, etc.",CO111CL12
16518,11,"Clearly, the function of this second soul, like the first, is to transmit life; together they complete the man, who is, metaphysically speaking, an orange.

I am not alluding to certain all-consuming souls, such as one’s country, of which Camões famously said that he would not only die in his country, but with it; or power, which was Caesar’s and Cromwell’s external soul. These are forceful, all-excluding souls, but others, though still forceful, are changeable in nature. There are gentlemen, for example, whose external soul in their earliest years is a rattle or a hobbyhorse, but later on in life it will be their seat on the board of a charity. For my part, I know a lady—and a charming creature she is too—who changes her external soul five or six times a year. During the season it’s the opera, and when the season is over, she swaps her external soul for another: a concert, a ball at the Cassino, a trip to Rua do Ouvidor or Petrópolis—”",CO111CL12

Cousins, aunts, uncles, everyone was bursting with the purest, sincerest joy.

16531,24,"I sat at the head of the table and was always served first. It was absurd, really. Such was Auntie Marcolina’s enthusiasm that she went so far as to have a large mirror placed in my room—a magnificent, ornate piece of work, quite out of keeping with the rest of the house, which was furnished simply and modestly. It had been given to her by her godmother, who had inherited it from her mother, who had bought it from one of the Portuguese noblewomen who came to Brazil in 1808 with the rest of King João VI’s court. I don’t know how much truth there was in this story, but that was the family tradition. Naturally, the mirror was very old, but you could still see the gilding, eaten away by time, a couple of carved dolphins in the top corners of the frame, a few bits of mother-of-pearl, and other such artistic flourishes. All rather old, but very good quality.”",CO111CL12

But there was no dissuading my aunt; she replied that it would not be missed, that it was only for a couple of weeks, and, after all, it was the least the ‘Senhor Lieutenant’ deserved. The fact is that all these little attentions, shows of affection, and kindnesses brought about a transformation in me, aided and abetted by the natural vanity of youth, as I’m sure you can imagine.”",CO111CL12

16569,3,"LATE ONE NIGHT, four or five gentlemen were debating various lofty matters, and although they all had different views, there were no frayed tempers. The house was situated on the Santa Teresa hill overlooking Rio; the room was small and lit by candles, whose glow mingled mysteriously with the moonlight streaming in from outside. Between the bustle and excitement of the city below and the sky above, where the stars were shining in the still, clear air, sat our four or five metaphysical detectives, amicably resolving the universe’s knottiest problems.",CO111CL10
16570,4,"Four or five, I say, and yet, strictly speaking, only four of them spoke, but there was a fifth person in the room who sat in silence, thinking or dozing, and whose only contribution to the debate was an occasional grunt of approval. The man was the same age as his companions, i.e., between forty and fifty years old; he was from the provinces, wealthy, intelligent, not uneducated, and, it would seem, shrewd and somewhat caustic.",CO111CL10
16571,5,"He never participated in their discussions or arguments, and always justified his silence with a paradox, saying that discussion was simply the polite form of the latent warrior instinct man had inherited from beasts. He would add that the seraphim and cherubim never disagreed, and they were eternal, spiritual perfection. When he gave this same answer that night, one of the others took him up on it and challenged him to prove his assertion, if he could. Jacobina (for that was his name) thought for a moment, then replied:",CO111CL10
16572,6,"“All things considered, perhaps you’re right.”",CO111CL10
16573,7,"And suddenly, in the middle of the night, this taciturn fellow began to hold forth, not for two or three minutes, but for thirty or forty. The meandering conversation had come to rest upon the nature of the soul, a point that radically divided the four friends. No two minds thought alike; not only was there no agreement, discussion became difficult, not to say impossible, on account of the multiplicity of issues branching out from the main trunk of the debate, and perhaps also on account of the inconsistency of the various positions adopted. One of the participants asked Jacobina to offer an opinion, or, at the very least, a conjecture.",CO111CL10
16574,8,"“No conjecture and no opinion,” he replied. “Either one can lead to disagreement and, as you all know, I never engage in arguments. But if you will listen in silence, I can tell you about an episode in my life that demonstrates the issue in question in the clearest possible terms. To begin with, there is not one soul, but two—”",CO111CL10
16575,9,“Two?”,CO111CL10
16576,10,"“Yes, two. Every human creature contains two souls: one that looks from the inside out, and the other that looks from the outside in. Go on, gawk, stare, shrug your shoulders, whatever you like, but don’t say anything. If you try to argue, I’ll finish my cigar and go home to bed. Now, the external soul can be a spirit, a fluid, a man (or many men), an object, even an action. There are cases, for example, of a simple shirt button being a person’s external soul, or it could be the polka, a card game, a book, a machine, a pair of boots, a song, a drum, etc.",CO111CL10
16577,11,"Clearly, the function of this second soul, like the first, is to transmit life; together they complete the man, who is, metaphysically speaking, an orange. Whoever loses one half, automatically loses half of his existence, and there have been instances, quite common ones, in which the loss of the external soul implies the loss of one’s entire existence.",CO111CL10

16579,13,The external soul of that particular Jew was his ducats; to lose them was the same as dying.,CO111CL10
16580,14,"‘I shall never see my gold again,’ he says to Tubal; ‘thou stick’st a dagger in me.’ Consider carefully his choice of words: for him, the loss of the ducats, his external soul, meant death. One must, of course, remember that the external soul does not always stay the same—”",CO111CL10
16581,15,“No?”,CO111CL10
16582,16,"“Indeed not, sir; it changes both in nature and in state. I am not alluding to certain all-consuming souls, such as one’s country, of which Camões famously said that he would not only die in his country, but with it; or power, which was Caesar’s and Cromwell’s external soul. These are forceful, all-excluding souls, but others, though still forceful, are changeable in nature. There are gentlemen, for example, whose external soul in their earliest years is a rattle or a hobbyhorse, but later on in life it will be their seat on the board of a charity. For my part, I know a lady—and a charming creature she is too—who changes her external soul five or six times a year. During the season it’s the opera, and when the season is over, she swaps her external soul for another: a concert, a ball at the Cassino, a trip to Rua do Ouvidor or Petrópolis—”",CO111CL10

16585,19,"Eager to hear the promised tale, his four companions forgot all about their raging controversy. Blessèd curiosity! Thou art not only the soul of civilization; thou art the apple of concord, a divine fruit that tastes quite different from the apple of mythology. The room, until then buzzing with physics and metaphysics, is now a becalmed sea; all eyes are on Jacobina, who trims his cigar while collecting his thoughts. Here’s how he began:",CO111CL10
16586,20,"“I was twenty-five years old and poor, and had just been made a second lieutenant in the National Guard, the very lowest rank of commissioned officer. You cannot imagine what a huge event this was in our house. My mother was so happy and so proud! She insisted on addressing me as her lieutenant. Cousins, aunts, uncles, everyone was bursting with the purest, sincerest joy. In the town, to be sure, there were several disgruntled fellows—a wailing and gnashing of teeth, as it says in the Scriptures—the reason being that there had been many candidates for the post, and these other fellows were the losers.",CO111CL10
16587,21,"I suppose some of their annoyance was less understandable, though, and arose simply from a feeling of resentment that someone else should be singled out for distinction. I remember how some young men, even friends of mine, looked at me askance for quite some time afterward. On the other hand, many people were pleased by my appointment, the proof of which is that the whole of my rather splendid uniform was paid for by friends.",CO111CL10
16588,22,"It was then that one of my aunts, Dona Marcolina, Captain Peçanha’s widow, who lived on a remote and isolated farm many leagues from town, begged me to come and see her, and to bring my uniform. I went, accompanied by a footman, who returned to town a few days later, because no sooner had Auntie Marcolina lured me to her house than she wrote to my mother telling her that she wouldn’t let me go for at least a month. And how she hugged me! She, too, called me her lieutenant. She pronounced me a handsome devil and, being a rather jolly sort herself, even confessed to envying the girl who would one day be my wife.",CO111CL10
16589,23,"She declared that there was not a man in the entire province who was my equal. And it was always lieutenant this, lieutenant that, every hour of the day or night. I asked her to call me Joãozinho as she used to, but she shook her head, exclaiming that, no, I was ‘Senhor Lieutenant’ and that was that. One of her brothers-in-law, her late husband’s brother, who lived in the house, also refused to address me in any other way. I was ‘Senhor Lieutenant’ not in jest but perfectly seriously, and in front of the slaves as well, who naturally followed suit.",CO111CL10
16590,24,"I sat at the head of the table and was always served first. It was absurd, really. Such was Auntie Marcolina’s enthusiasm that she went so far as to have a large mirror placed in my room—a magnificent, ornate piece of work, quite out of keeping with the rest of the house, which was furnished simply and modestly. It had been given to her by her godmother, who had inherited it from her mother, who had bought it from one of the Portuguese noblewomen who came to Brazil in 1808 with the rest of King João VI’s court. I don’t know how much truth there was in this story, but that was the family tradition. Naturally, the mirror was very old, but you could still see the gilding, eaten away by time, a couple of carved dolphins in the top corners of the frame, a few bits of mother-of-pearl, and other such artistic flourishes. All rather old, but very good quality.”",CO111CL10
16591,25,“Was it large?”,CO111CL10
16592,26,"“Indeed it was. And as I say, it was really very kind of her, because the mirror had previously been in the parlor, and was the best piece in the house. But there was no dissuading my aunt; she replied that it would not be missed, that it was only for a couple of weeks, and, after all, it was the least the ‘Senhor Lieutenant’ deserved. The fact is that all these little attentions, shows of affection, and kindnesses brought about a transformation in me, aided and abetted by the natural vanity of youth, as I’m sure you can imagine.”",CO111CL10
16593,27,"“Well, no, actually.”",CO111CL10
16594,28,"“The officer eliminated the man. For several days, the two hung in the balance, but it wasn’t long before my original nature gave way to the other; only a tiny part of my humanity remained. What had happened was that my external soul, which, up until then, had been the sun, the air, the rolling countryside, and the eyes of young women, changed entirely and became the bowing and scraping that went on around the house, everything that spoke to me of my rank, and nothing about me, the man. Only the officer remained; the private citizen had vanished into thin air, and into the past. Hard to believe, isn’t it?”",CO111CL10
16595,29,"“I find it hard even to understand,” replied one of his listeners.",CO111CL10
16596,30,"“You will in due course. Actions are better at explaining feelings: actions are everything. After all, even the very best definition of love is no match for a kiss from the girl you’re courting, and, if memory serves me right, an ancient philosopher once demonstrated movement by walking. So let’s cut to the chase. Let us see how, as the consciousness of the man was slowly being obliterated, that of the officer was becoming intensely alive. Human suffering and human joys, if that’s all they were, barely won from me so much as an apathetic nod or a condescending smile. After three weeks, I was a different person, changed utterly.",CO111CL10
16597,31,I was all lieutenant and nothing else.,CO111CL10
16598,32,"Then one day, Auntie Marcolina received some grave news. One of her daughters, married to a farmer who lived five leagues away, was ill, perhaps dying. Farewell, nephew! Farewell, Lieutenant! The distraught mother immediately made arrangements to travel, asked her brother-in-law to go with her, and me to take charge of the farm. I believe that had she not been so upset she would have done the opposite, leaving the brother-in-law behind and taking me with her.",CO111CL10
16599,33,"As it turned out, however, I was left on my own, with a couple of household slaves. I immediately felt a great sense of oppression, as if the four walls of a prison had suddenly closed around me. It was my external soul contracting, you see, for now it was limited to a handful of half savages. The officer continued to hold sway within me, albeit less intensely alive and less fiercely conscious.",CO111CL10
16600,34,"The slaves put a note of humility into their bows and curtsys, which somewhat made up for the lack of family affection and the interruption of domestic intimacy. That same night, they noticeably redoubled their cheerful expressions of respect and admiration. It was ‘Massa’ Lieutenant every other minute. Massa Lieutenant very handsome, Massa Lieutenant soon be colonel, Massa Lieutenant marry pretty girl, general’s daughter; a concerto of praise and prophesies that left me feeling ecstatic. Ah, the traitors! Little did I suspect the scoundrels’ secret intentions.”",CO111CL10
16601,35,“What? To kill you?”,CO111CL10
16602,36,“If only.”,CO111CL10
16603,37,“Worse?”,CO111CL10
16604,38,"“Just listen. The following morning I awoke to find myself alone. The scoundrels, whether egged on by others or of their own accord, had plotted to run away in the night, and had done precisely that. I found myself completely alone, with no one else within the four walls of the house, staring out at the deserted yard and empty countryside beyond. Not a single human breath. I searched the house, the slave quarters, everywhere, but found nothing and no one, not a single pickaninny. Only some cocks and hens, a pair of mules philosophizing about life as they flicked away the flies, and three oxen.",CO111CL10
16605,39,"The slaves had even taken the dogs. Not a single human being. Do you think this was better than dying? Well, I can tell you it was worse. Not that I was afraid; I swear to you that I wasn’t; in fact, I was almost devil-may-care, to the point of not feeling anything at all during those first few hours. After that, I felt sad for Auntie Marcolina’s financial loss, and was in somewhat of a quandary as to whether I should go and see her and give her the bad news, or stay and take care of the house.",CO111CL10
16606,40,"I opted for the latter course of action, so as not to leave the house completely defenseless, and because, if my cousin was seriously ill, I would only be increasing her mother’s distress without providing any remedy. Besides, I expected Uncle Peçanha’s brother to return that day or the next, since he’d already been gone thirty-six hours. But the morning passed with no sign of him, and during the afternoon I began to feel decidedly odd, like someone who has lost all sensation in his nerves and can no longer feel his muscles move.",CO111CL10

16629,4,"DON’T ASK ME about Dr. Jeremias Halma’s family, nor what brought him to Rio de Janeiro in that year of 1768, during the viceroyalty of the Count of Azambuja, who people initially said had been the one to send for the doctor, a version of events that proved short-lived. He came, he stayed, and he died with the century. What I can, however, confirm is that he was Dutch, and a physician.",CO127CL10
16630,5,"He had traveled widely, knew everything there was to know about chemistry, and spoke five or six living languages fluently, as well as two dead ones. He was such an inventive and universal fellow that he endowed Malay poetry with a new meter and conceived a theory on the formation of diamonds, not to mention the many therapeutic advances he made, as well as innumerable other admirable things.",CO127CL10
16631,6,"And all this without being in the least pigheaded or arrogant. On the contrary, his life and person were like the house that a fellow Dutchman procured for him on Rua do Piolho, a very humble house indeed, where he died sometime around Christmas 1799. Yes, Dr. Halma was unpretentious, sincere, and modest, indeed so modest that . . . But no, that would upset the order of the story. Let’s start at the beginning.",CO127CL10
16632,7,"At the end of Rua do Ouvidor, which had not yet become the Via Dolorosa of long-suffering husbands that it is today, near what used to be Rua dos Latoeiros, there lived at that time a certain Tomé Gonçalves, a wealthy man and, according to some accounts, a member of the city council. Councillor or not, this Tomé Gonçalves had not only money, he also had debts, which were neither few nor recent. These arrears could easily be explained by carelessness or, indeed, knavery; but anyone who favors one or other of these interpretations clearly has no business reading a serious piece of writing like this.",CO127CL10
16633,8,"After all, there is no point in someone going to all the effort of scribbling page after page just to say that at the end of the last century there lived a man who, for reasons of crookery or carelessness, failed to pay his creditors. Accounts confirm that this fellow countryman of ours was precise in everything he did, punctilious in the most mundane duties, strict, and even meticulous. The truth is that he was a “redeemed brother” of many lay orders and confraternities and had been since the days when he was still in the habit of paying his debts; and those that had the good fortune to count him as one of their members did not need to wrangle out of him tokens of his devotion and esteem; and, if he was indeed a councillor, as all the evidence suggests, one can be sure that he served to the satisfaction of the whole city.",CO127CL10
16634,9,"So? I’m coming to that now, for the subject matter of this piece is precisely this curious phenomenon, the cause of which is known only because Dr. Halma discovered it. On the afternoon of a religious procession, Tomé Gonçalves, wearing the habit of a lay order and helping to carry one of the floats bearing holy images, was walking along with the serene look of a man who does ill to no man. Looking on from windows and sidewalks were many of his creditors, and two of them, standing at the corner of Beco das Cancelas (the procession was making its way down Rua do Hospício), after duly kneeling, praying, crossing themselves, and standing up again, asked one another whether now was perhaps the time to resort to law.",CO127CL10
16635,10,"“What’s the worst that can happen?” said one of them. “If he quarrels with me, all the better; he’ll get nothing more from me without paying for it first. Without a quarrel, I can hardly refuse to give him what he asks, and so I’ll just keep on selling him more and more stuff on credit in the hope that he does finally pay me what he already owes. No, sir; it can’t go on like this.”",CO127CL10
16636,11,"“As for me,” said the other, “the only reason I haven’t done anything before is because of my wife, who’s scared, and thinks I shouldn’t quarrel with important people like him. But other people’s importance won’t put food or drink on the table. And what about my wigs?”",CO127CL10
16637,12,"The latter was a wigmaker on Rua da Vala, opposite the cathedral, who had sold Tomé Gonçalves ten wigs in five years, without seeing so much as a penny from him. The other was a tailor, and an even bigger creditor than the wigmaker. By now the procession had passed by, but they remained on that same street corner, agreeing that they should send in the bailiffs. The wigmaker commented that there were many other creditors ready and waiting to swoop on the delinquent debtor, and the tailor thought it would be a good idea to include Mata the shoemaker in their scheme, since his situation was now desperate.",CO127CL10
16638,13,"Tomé Gonçalves owed him more than eighty mil-réis. They were discussing this when they heard a voice behind them asking, in a foreign accent, why they were plotting against a sick man. They turned around and, coming face-to-face with Dr. Halma, the two creditors removed their caps; with the greatest of respect, they then pointed out that the debtor was very far from being sick, for there he was taking part in the procession, hale and hearty, helping to shoulder one of the floats.",CO127CL10
16639,14,“What’s that got to do with it?” interrupted the doctor. “No one’s saying there’s anything wrong with his arms or legs . . .”,CO127CL10
16640,15,"“His heart, then? Or his stomach?”",CO127CL10
16641,16,"“Neither heart nor stomach,” replied Dr. Halma, and he continued, very gently, explaining that it was a highly speculative matter, which he could not discuss there on the street, and indeed he wasn’t sure if they would understand him. “If I had to style someone’s hair or cut a pair of breeches,” he added, so as not to upset them, “it’s highly unlikely that I would meet the exacting standards of your respective professions, so useful and indeed essential to the state . . .”",CO127CL10
16642,17,"Chuckling amiably, he bade them good day and continued on his way. The two creditors stood there openmouthed. The wigmaker was the first to speak, saying that the news from Dr. Halma should not discourage them in their efforts to get paid. “If even the dead pay up, or at least someone else does on their behalf,” reflected the wigmaker, “then it’s only right to ask the sick to do the same.” The tailor, envious of the wigmaker’s little joke, stitched on his own witty frill: “Pay up and be cured!”",CO127CL10
16643,18,"This opinion was not shared by Mata the shoemaker, who thought some secret lay behind Dr. Halma’s words, and proposed that, first, they should carefully analyze what this might be, and then decide upon the most appropriate course of action. They then invited other creditors to join them in conclave the following Sunday at the house of a certain Dona Aninha, in the vicinity of Rocio, on the pretext of a baptism.",CO127CL10
16644,19,"The precaution was a prudent one, so as not to give the superintendent of police reason to suspect that the gathering concerned any shady machinations against the state. As soon as darkness fell, the creditors began to arrive, swathed in cloaks, and, as public street-lighting only came in with the Count of Resende’s viceroyalty, each of them carried a hand lantern as custom then dictated, thereby giving their cabal a touch of the theatrical and picturesque. There were thirty or forty of them, and they were not all of his creditors, either.",CO127CL10
16645,20,"Charles Lamb’s theory about the division of humankind into two great races came after the Rocio cabal, but here we have no better example to demonstrate it. The men’s distressed and downcast demeanor, the despair of some and the anxieties of all, were proof in advance that the distinguished essayist’s theory was indeed true, and that of the two great human races—those who lend and those who borrow—the sad gestures of the former contrast with “the open, trusting, generous manners of the other.” For at that very same hour, having returned home from the procession, Tomé Gonçalves was gaily entertaining some of his friends with the wine and chicken he had purchased on credit, while his creditors, pale and disillusioned, were secretly trying to work out some way of getting their money back.",CO127CL10
16646,21,"The debate was long and no single opinion convinced everyone. Some were inclined to litigate, others to wait, and more than a few were open to consulting Dr. Halma. Five or six partisans of this latter course of action seemed to favor it, but only with the secret and disguised intention of doing nothing whatsoever, for they were the slaves of fear and hope. The wigmaker opposed it, asking what illness could possibly prevent a man from paying what he owed. But Mata the shoemaker said to him:",CO127CL10
16647,22,"“My good friend, ours is not to reason why; just remember that the doctor is a foreigner, and in foreign parts they know things they wouldn’t even tell the devil. In any case, it wouldn’t take long.” This argument won the day, and they appointed the shoemaker, the tailor, and the wigmaker to speak to Dr. Halma on everyone’s behalf, and the cabal dissolved into general merrymaking. Terpsichore herself, the muse of dance, leapt and spun her joyful graces before them, so much so that some even forgot the secret ulcer gnawing away inside them.",CO127CL10

16649,24,"The following day, between seven and eight o’clock in the morning, Dr. Halma received the three creditors, “Come in, come in . . .” And with his broad Dutch face and a laugh that spilled from his mouth like a full-bodied wine from a broken cask, the great physician came in person to open the door to them. At that moment, he was engrossed in studying a snake found dead the previous day on Santo Antônio hill; but, as he liked to say, humanity takes precedence over science. He invited the three men to sit down on the only three empty chairs in the room; the fourth chair was his own, while all the others, some five or six, were piled high with all manner of things.",CO127CL10
16650,25,"It was Mata the shoemaker who explained the problem; of the three he was the most endowed with diplomatic talents. He began by saying that the good doctor’s skill was going to save a large number of families from destitution, and it would be neither the first nor the last great work of a doctor who—with no disrespect to the local doctors—was the wisest to have been seen there since the days of Gomes Freire’s government.",CO127CL10
16651,26,"Tomé Gonçalves’s creditors had no one else to turn to. Knowing that the good doctor attributed Gonçalves’s arrears to an illness, they had decided that a cure should first be attempted, before resorting to legal proceedings. They would keep litigation as a last resort, if all else failed. This was what they had come to tell him, on behalf of dozens of creditors. They wanted to know if it was true that, on top of all the other possible human ailments, the nonpayment of debts was yet another illness, and whether it was incurable, and, if it wasn’t, whether the tears of so many families might—",CO127CL10
16652,27,"“There is a rather unusual illness,” interrupted Dr. Halma, visibly moved by their plight, “known as a ‘memory lapse.’ To put it quite simply, Tomé Gonçalves has lost all notion of paying for anything. The reason he fails to settle his bills is neither a deliberate ploy nor mere carelessness; rather, the idea of paying, of handing over the price of a thing, has been entirely erased from his mind. I discovered this two months ago when I was at his house, and the prior of the Carmo monastery called by, saying he had come to ‘pay him the courtesy of a visit.’",CO127CL10
16653,28,"No sooner had the prior left than Tomé Gonçalves asked me what ‘pay’ meant and added that, several days earlier, an apothecary had used the same word, without any further explanation, and he thought he had also heard it from other people. Hearing the prior say it, he supposed it must be Latin. I understood everything then; I had studied this condition in various parts of the world, and I understood that he was suffering an attack of ‘memory lapse.’ It was for this very reason that I said to these two gentlemen the other day that they should not issue proceedings against a sick man.",CO127CL10
16654,29,"“But then,” ventured Mata, turning pale, “our money is completely lost . . .”",CO127CL10
16655,30,"“The illness is not incurable,” said the doctor.",CO127CL10
16656,31,“Ah!”,CO127CL10
16657,32,"“Indeed not. I both know of and possess the drug that will cure it, and I have already employed it in two major cases: a barber who had so entirely lost any notion of space that one night he reached up to pluck the stars from the sky, and a lady from Catalonia who had lost all notion of her husband. The barber risked his life many times trying to jump out of the highest windows in the house, as if he were on the ground floor . . .”",CO127CL10
16658,33,“Good gracious!” exclaimed the three creditors.,CO127CL10
16659,34,"“My feelings exactly,” the doctor continued calmly. “As for the Catalan lady, at first she confused her husband with a graduate called Matias, who was tall and slim, whereas her husband was short and fat; then with a captain called Hermógenes, and, at the time I began to treat her, with a clergyman. In three months she was completely cured. Her name was Dona Agostinha.”",CO127CL10
16660,35,"It was a truly miraculous drug. The three creditors were radiant with hope; everything indicated that Tomé Gonçalves was indeed suffering from that ‘lapse,’ and since a drug existed, and the doctor had it in his house . . . Ah! but there was the rub. Although the doctor was on good terms with the man, Tomé Gonçalves was not one of Dr. Halma’s regular patients, and he could scarcely turn up at his house offering his services. Tomé Gonçalves had no close family to take responsibility for calling a doctor, and the creditors could scarcely assume the burden themselves.",CO127CL10
16661,36,"Silent and perplexed, the creditors exchanged glances. Those of the tailor, like the wigmaker’s, expressed the following desperate suggestion: that the creditors should all chip in, and, by means of a fat and appetizing sum, invite Dr. Halma to perform his cure. Perhaps the money . . . But the illustrious Mata saw the danger in such a proposal, since the patient might not recover and their losses would thereby be doubled. Great was their anguish; all seemed lost. The doctor twirled his snuffbox between his fingers, waiting for them to leave, not impatiently, but cheerfully.",CO127CL10
16662,37,"It was then that Mata, like a captain in the grand old days of yore, saw the enemy’s weak point. He had noticed that his opening words had moved the doctor, and so returned to his theme of their families’ tears and their children’s empty stomachs, for they were but humble artisans or tradesmen of little means, whereas Tomé Gonçalves was rich. Shoes, breeches, cloaks, cough syrups, wigs, all these things cost them time, money, and health . . . Yes, sir, health; the calluses on his hands showed clearly that his trade was a hard one, and his good friend the tailor, standing here among them, who spluttered and coughed with consumption night after night by the light of a candle, endlessly stitching away with his needle and thread . . .",CO127CL10
16663,38,"Kind, generous Jeremias! His eyes had filled up with tears before the shoemaker could finish. The awkwardness of his manner was compensated by the effusions of a devout and human heart. Yes, of course he would try to cure him; he would place science at the service of a just cause. Moreover, the main beneficiary would be Tomé Gonçalves himself, for his reputation was now in tatters on account of something for which he was as blameless as a blasphemous lunatic. Naturally the delegation’s delight translated into endless bows and extravagant praise for the doctor’s exemplary qualities.",CO127CL10
16664,39,"The latter modestly cut this short by asking them to join him for breakfast, an honor which they declined, meanwhile thanking him most cordially. Even when they were out in the street where the doctor could no longer hear them, they did not tire of praising his wisdom, goodness, generosity, and courtesy. Such simple, natural good manners!",CO127CL10
16665,40,"From that day on, Tomé Gonçalves began to notice that the doctor had become an assiduous visitor, and—with no ulterior motive, because he genuinely liked him—he did everything he could to attach him to his household once and for all. His “lapse” was indeed complete; not just the idea of paying, but also the related notions of creditor, debt, bills, and so on, had been completely erased from his memory, forming a large hole in his mind.",CO127CL10
16666,41,"I fear I may be accused of making fanciful comparisons, but Pascal’s abyss is the one that most readily comes to mind. Tomé Gonçalves had Pascal’s abyss not beside him, but within his very being, and it was so deep that it held within it more than sixty creditors, thrashing around down there with a wailing and gnashing of teeth, as the Scriptures put it. It was an urgent matter to fish out all those unhappy creatures and fill in the hole.",CO127CL10
16667,42,"Jeremias convinced the patient that he was under the weather, and, to reinvigorate him, began administering the drug. On its own, the drug was not enough; an accompanying therapy was also necessary, because the cure operated on two levels. The general or abstract level, i.e., restoring the idea of paying, along with all other related notions, was the part entrusted to the drug; whereas the specific or concrete level, i.e., the suggesting or naming of a particular debt and a particular creditor, fell to the doctor. Let’s suppose that the first chosen creditor was the shoemaker.",CO127CL10
16668,43,"The doctor would take the patient to various shoe shops in order to witness the sale and purchase of the merchandise, and watch again and again the action of paying; he would talk about the manufacture and sale of shoes throughout the world, and compare the price of footwear in that year of 1768 with the prices of thirty or forty years earlier; he would get the shoemaker to visit Tomé Gonçalves’s house ten or twenty times to present his bill and ask for his money; and a hundred other such stratagems.",CO127CL10
16669,44,"One by one, the same thing happened with the tailor, the wigmaker, the coachmaker, and the apothecary; it took longer with the ones who went first, for the perfectly natural reason that the illness was more ingrained, whereas the preceding efforts benefited those who went later, and compensated them for the delay.",CO127CL10
16670,45,"All bills were paid. The creditors’ joy was indescribable, the blessings they heaped upon the name of Dr. Halma too numerous to mention. “Yes, sir, a great man,” they shouted high and low. “Sounds like witchcraft to me,” ventured the women. As for Tomé Gonçalves, astonished at so many old debts, he never tired of praising his creditors’ forbearance, and at the same time reprimanded them for letting them accumulate.",CO127CL10
16671,46,"“From now on,” he told them, “I want to be billed every week.”",CO127CL10
16672,47,"“Don’t worry, we’ll remind you,” was the creditors’ wholehearted response.",CO127CL10
16673,48,"There remained, however, one creditor. This was the most recent, Dr. Halma himself, for his fees for that valuable service rendered. But, alas, modesty tied his tongue. As generous of heart as he was awkward of manner, he planned three, even five attempts, but didn’t manage even one. And yet it would have been the easiest thing in the world; he merely needed to suggest the debt using the same method employed in relation to the others. But was that appropriate? he asked himself; was it decent? So he waited, and waited. Not wanting to appear too brazen, he began to visit less frequently, but Tomé Gonçalves would go to the doctor’s modest house on Rua do Piolho and take him out to dinner or supper and discuss foreign affairs, about which he was very curious, but never saying a word about paying.",CO127CL10
16674,49,"Dr. Halma began to think that perhaps the creditors might do so, but even though the thought of reminding Tomé Gonçalves about the unpaid doctor’s bill might have crossed their minds, the creditors did nothing, because they presumed it had been paid first, before all the others. That, at least, is what they told each other, clothed in many formulations of popular wisdom—Look first to your own, Matthew—Charity begins at home—A fool asks God to kill him and the devil to take his soul, etc. All false; the truth is that on the day he died, Tomé Gonçalves had only one creditor in the world: Dr. Halma.",CO127CL10
16675,50,"By then, in 1798, Dr. Halma was virtually a saint. “Farewell to a great man!” Mata, now ex-shoemaker, said to him, as they sat in the chaise taking them both to Tomé Gonçalves’s requiem mass at the Carmelite church.

16725,50,“Ah! That’s right. . . .”,CO051CL08
16726,51,"There was no obvious reason for Luís Negreiros, after those words uttered in a gloomy tone, to have spoken them again, but this time in an uncommonly joyful tone:",CO051CL08
16727,52,“Ah! That’s right!. . .”,CO051CL08
16728,53,"Meireles, who was putting his parasol on a hat stand in the hall, turned to his son-in-law, on whose face he saw the frankest, most sudden, and most inexplicable joy.",CO051CL08
16729,54,“He’s crazy!” Meireles said softly to himself.,CO051CL08
16730,55,"“Let’s eat,” shouted the son-in-law, going farther into the house, while Meireles, taking the hall, made his way to the dining room.",CO051CL08
16731,56,"Luís Negreiros went looking for his wife in the sewing room, and he found her standing up, arranging her hair in front of a mirror:",CO051CL08
16732,57,"“Thank you,” he said.",CO051CL08
16733,58,The young woman looked at him in astonishment.,CO051CL08
16734,59,"“Thank you,” said Luís Negreiros again. “Thank you, and forgive me.”",CO051CL08
16735,60,"At these words, Luís Negreiros tried to embrace her, but the young woman, with a noble gesture, rejected the caress and headed to the dining room.",CO051CL08
16736,61,“She’s right!” muttered Luís Negreiros.,CO051CL08
16737,62,"A bit later, all three of them found themselves at the dinner table and were served the soup, which Meireles, of course, found cold. He was about to launch into a speech about the carelessness of the servants when Luís Negreiros confessed that it was all his fault, since dinner had been on the table for a long time.",CO051CL08
16738,63,"His declaration hardly changed the subject of the speech, which then turned to what a terrible thing a reheated dinner—qui ne valut jamais rien—was.",CO051CL08
16739,64,"Meireles was a cheerful, facetious man, perhaps too frivolous for his age, but an interesting person in any case. Luís Negreiros was very fond of him, and this fondness worthy of a relative and friend was reciprocated, all the sincerer in that Meireles had given him his daughter only after a long time and reluctantly.",CO051CL08
16740,65,"The courtship lasted nearly four years, with Clarinha’s father taking more than two thinking about the marriage and working it out. In the end, he gave his consent, influenced more by his daughter’s tears than by his son-in-law’s qualities, or so he said.",CO051CL08
16741,66,"Luís Negreiros’s less-than-austere habits were the cause of the long hesitation—not those he had shown during the courtship but those he had shown before and could return to later. Meireles confessed fondly that he himself hadn’t exactly been a model husband, and for that very reason he thought he should give his daughter to a husband better than he had been.",CO051CL08
16742,67,"Luís Negreiros confounded his father-in-law’s apprehensions; the hot-tempered lion of old became a peaceful lamb. A frank friendship sprang up between father-in-law and son-in-law, and Clarinha became one of the most envied young women in the city.",CO051CL08
16743,68,And Luís Negreiros’s merit was all the greater in that he did not want for temptations. The devil sometimes got into the skin of a friend of his and went to invite him to a commemoration of old times. But Luís Negreiros would say he had made it safely ashore and didn’t want to brave the storms of the high seas anymore.,CO051CL08
16744,69,"Clarinha loved her husband tenderly and was at the time the sweetest and most gracious creature breathing the air of Rio de Janeiro. Never between the two of them had there been the slightest dispute; the clarity of the conjugal sky was always the same, and it looked to be lasting. What bad luck blew in the first cloud?",CO051CL08
16745,70,"At dinner Clarinha didn’t say a word—or rather she said few, as curtly as possible and in a dry tone.",CO051CL08
16746,71,"“They’re in a tiff, without a doubt,” thought Meireles on seeing his daughter’s stubborn silence. “Or maybe just she’s in a tiff, because he strikes me as happy.”",CO051CL08
16747,72,"Luís Negreiros was in fact overwhelming his wife, who was not even looking at him, with endearments, caresses, and gallantries. The husband had now had enough of his father-in-law and wanted to be alone with his wife for the explanation that would reconcile them. Clarinha seemed not to want it; she ate little, and two or three times she let out a little sigh.",CO051CL08
16748,73,"It was clear that the dinner, no matter what efforts were made, would not be the same as on other days.",CO051CL08
16749,74,"Meireles, above all, was uncomfortable. It wasn’t that he was dreading some big problem; his belief was that without disputes it was impossible to appreciate happiness, just as without storms one didn’t appreciate good weather.",CO051CL08
16750,75,"Withal, his daughter’s sadness always put a damper on things for him.",CO051CL08
16751,76,"When the coffee came, Meireles suggested that all three of them go to the theater; Luís Negreiros accepted the idea with enthusiasm. Clarinha refused curtly.",CO051CL08
16752,77,"“I don’t understand you today, Clarinha,” her father said to her impatiently. “Your husband is cheerful, and you look downcast and worried. What’s wrong?”",CO051CL08
16753,78,"Clarinha didn’t answer; Luís Negreiros, not knowing what to say, decided to make little balls with the doughy part of the bread. Meireles shrugged.",CO051CL08
16754,79,"“Well, it’s your business,” he said. “If tomorrow, despite being the day it is, you act the same way, I promise you you won’t see even my shadow.”",CO051CL08
16755,80,"“Oh, you must come,” Luís Negreiros said, but he was interrupted by his wife, who burst out crying.",CO051CL08
16756,81,"Dinner came to a cheerless and horrid end. Meireles asked his son-in-law to explain to him what was happening, and he promised him he would tell him everything on the right occasion.",CO051CL08
16757,82,"Clarinha’s father left shortly thereafter, protesting again that if he were to find them the same way the next day he would never again set foot in their house and that if there was anything worse than a cold and reheated meal it was a badly digested meal. This axiom was as good as Boileau’s, but no one paid it any heed.",CO051CL08
16758,83,"Clarinha went to her room; as soon as he had seen his father-in-law off, her husband went to talk to her. He found her sitting on the bed, with her head on a pillow, and sobbing. Luís Negreiros got down on his knees in front of her and took one of her hands.",CO051CL08
16759,84,"“Clarinha,” he said to her, “forgive me everything. I have the reason for the watch now; if your father hadn’t talked to me about coming for dinner tomorrow, I would never have imagined that the watch was a birthday present you were giving me.”",CO051CL08
16760,85,I don’t dare describe the lofty gesture of indignation with which the young woman got to her feet when she heard her husband’s words. Luís Negreiros watched her in utter incomprehension. The young woman didn’t say a word; she walked out of the room and left her hapless spouse more astonished than ever.,CO051CL08
16761,86,"“But what is this enigma?” Luís Negreiros asked himself. “If it’s not a birthday present, what possible explanation is there for this watch?”",CO051CL08
16762,87,"The situation was the same as before dinner. Luís Negreiros resolved to discover everything that night. All the same, he thought he would do well to reflect fully on the case to come to a definitive resolution of it.",CO051CL08
16763,88,"With this aim, he withdrew to his study, and there he went back over everything that had happened since he had gotten home. Dispassionately, he weighed every motive, every incident, and he tried to reproduce in his memory the expression on his young wife’s face throughout that evening.",CO051CL08
16764,89,"The gesture of indignation and her abhorrence when he went to embrace her in the sewing room were in her favor; but the impulse with which she had checked herself when he showed her the watch, the tears she shed at the table, and above all the silence she had kept with respect to the origin of the fateful object all weighed against the young woman.",CO051CL08
16765,90,"Luís Negreiros, after racking his brains for a long time, succumbed to the saddest and most deplorable of hypotheses.",CO051CL08
16766,91,"An awful thought started boring into his mind like a drill, and it got so far in that it took possession of him in a few seconds. Luís Negreiros was a wrathful man when the occasion called for it. He uttered two or three threats, left the study, and went to confront his wife.",CO051CL08
16767,92,"Clarinha had gone back to her room. The door was ajar. It was nine at night; a small lamp was giving off a dim light. The young woman was sitting on the bed again, but she was no longer crying; her gaze was turned on the floor. She didn’t look up even when she heard her husband come in.",CO051CL08
16768,93,There was a moment of silence.,CO051CL08
16769,94,Luís Negreiros was the first to speak.,CO051CL08
16770,95,"“Clarinha,” he said, “this moment is serious. Are you going to answer me what I’ve been asking you since this afternoon?”",CO051CL08
16771,96,The young woman didn’t answer.,CO051CL08
16772,97,"“Think about it, Clarinha,” went on her husband. “You could be risking your life.”",CO051CL08
16773,98,The young woman shrugged.,CO051CL08
16774,99,A cloud passed before Luís Negreiros’s eyes. The unhappy husband his hands around his wife’s neck and shouted:,CO051CL08
16775,100,"“Answer, damn it, or you die!”",CO051CL08
16776,101,Clarinha let out a cry.,CO051CL08
16777,102,“Wait!” she said.,CO051CL08
16778,103,Luís Negreiros backed off.,CO051CL08
16779,104,"“Kill me,” she said, “but read this first. When this letter went to your office you were already gone; that’s what the messenger told me.”",CO051CL08
16780,105,"Luís Negreiros took the letter, went over to the lamp, and, thunderstruck, read these lines:",CO051CL08
16781,106,“My nhonhô. I know it’s your birthday tomorrow; I’m sending you this gift. —Aunt Iaiá.”,CO051CL08
16782,107,Thus ended the story of the gold watch.,CO051CL08
16783,1,The Gold Watch_Miss Dollar_eng,CO051CL09
16784,2,"Now I will tell you the story of the gold watch. It was a big and entirely new chronometer, working over some precious stones. Luiz Negreiros had all the right to be astonished when he saw the watch at home, a watch that didn’t belong to him, and couldn’t belong to his wife either.",CO051CL09
16785,3,"Couldn’t it be an illusion of his eyes? It wasn’t; the watch was there, over the bedroom’s table, staring at him, perhaps as scared as he was about the place and the situation.",CO051CL09
16786,4,"Clarinha wasn’t in the bedroom when Luiz Negreiros entered. She stayed in the living room, flipping through a novel, reciprocating not less nor much to the kiss her husband had given her when he arrived.",CO051CL09
16787,5,"Clarinha was a beautiful young lady despite her paleness, or maybe just because of it; she was small and slim. From a distance she looked like a child; the one who closely examined her eyes would see that she was a woman like few.",CO051CL09
16788,6,"She was leaning softly on the sofa, with the book open, and the eyes on the book, only the eyes, because I’m not sure if her thoughts were on the book or somewhere else. In any case she seemed unaware of her husband and the watch.",CO051CL09
16789,7,Luiz Negreiros took the clock with an expression that I don’t dare describing. Neither the watch nor the chain belonged to him; they also didn’t belong to the people he knew. It was a puzzle.,CO051CL09
16790,8,"Luiz Negreiros liked puzzles, and was considered to be a fearless decipherer; but he liked puzzles only in the almanacs and fashion magazines. Luiz Negreiros didn’t appreciate puzzles which were alive and palpable, and above all without concept.",CO051CL09
16791,9,"For this reason, and for others that are obvious, the reader will understand why Clarinha’s husband threw himself on a chair, pulled his hair out nervously, stamped his foot on the floor and threw the watch and the chain over the table.",CO051CL09
16792,10,"As his first rage manifestation was over, Luiz Negreiros took the fatal objects and examined them again. His disposition was the same. He crossed his arms for a while and reflected about the case, questioned all his memories and concluded that, without Clarinha’s explanations, his behavior was useless and impulsive.",CO051CL09
16793,11,He left the room.,CO051CL09
16794,12,Clarinha had just finished reading a page and was turning it back with the unconcerned and peaceful air of those who aren’t concerned about deciphering chronometer puzzles. Luiz Negreiros looked straight at her; his eyes were similar to two glowing daggers.,CO051CL09
16795,13,"“What’s your problem?” she asked with that sweet, soft voice that everybody agreed she had.",CO051CL09
16796,14,"Luiz Negreiros didn’t answer his wife’s question. He looked at her for a while, then went around the room twice, passing the hands through his hair, and making other gestures so that the lady asked again:",CO051CL09
16797,15,“What’s your problem?”,CO051CL09
16798,16,Luiz Negreiros stopped in front of her.,CO051CL09
16799,17,"“What’s this?” he said, taking the fatal watch from his pocket and presenting it in front of her eyes. “What’s this?” he repeated with a thunder voice.",CO051CL09
16800,18,"Clarinha bit her lips and didn’t answer the question. Luiz Negreiros kept the watch in his hands for a while and his eyes on his wife, who had her eyes on the book. There was a deep silence.",CO051CL09
16801,19,"Luiz Negreiros was the first to break it, throwing the watch on the floor noisily then saying to his wife:",CO051CL09
16802,20,"“Go on, whose watch is that?”",CO051CL09
16803,21,"Clarinha slowly raised her eyes towards him, then looked down, and murmured:",CO051CL09
16804,22,“I don’t know.”,CO051CL09
16805,23,"Luiz Negreiros made a gesture as if he wanted to strangle her; he refrained himself. His wife stood up, took the watch and put it on a small table. Luiz Negreiros couldn’t refrain himself. He walked towards her, and holding her wrists tightly, he said:",CO051CL09
16806,24,"“Won’t you answer me, demon? Won’t you explain this puzzle to me?”",CO051CL09
16807,25,"Clarinha made a gesture of pain, and Luiz Negreiros immediately let off her wrists, which were tightly compressed. If the circumstances were different, it is probable that Luiz Negreiros would fall on her feet and apologize for hurting her. He didn’t even remember this; he left her in the middle of the room and began to walk around again, always agitated, stopping at intervals, as if he was meditating upon a tragic ending.",CO051CL09
16808,26,Clarinha left the room.,CO051CL09
16809,27,Soon after a slave announced that the dinner was served.,CO051CL09
16810,28,“Where is the lady?”,CO051CL09
16811,29,"“I don’t know, sir.”",CO051CL09
16812,30,"Luiz Negreiros went looking for his wife; he found her in a small sewing room, sitting on a low chair, sobbing with her head in her hands. She raised her head when she heard the noise as he closed the door behind her, and Luiz Negreiros could see that her face was all wet with tears.",CO051CL09
16813,31,"This situation was even worse for him than in the room. Luiz Negreiros couldn’t see a woman crying, especially if the woman was his wife. He was going to dry her tears with a kiss, but he refrained himself again and walked coldly towards her; he pulled a chair and sat in front of Clarinha.",CO051CL09
16814,32,"“I am calm, as you can see.” he said. “Answer this question with the same sincerity that you have always used with me. I’m not accusing nor suspecting of you. I only wanted to know how that watch appeared there. Did your father forget it here?”",CO051CL09
16815,33,“No.”,CO051CL09
16816,34,“But then…”,CO051CL09
16817,35,“Oh! don’t you ask me anything!” Clarinha exclaimed. “I really don’t know how this watch appeared there… I don’t know to whom it belongs…. Leave me alone.”,CO051CL09
16818,36,"“It’s too much!” Luiz Negreiros screamed, standing up and throwing the chair on the floor.",CO051CL09
16819,37,"Clarinha trembled and remained in the same place. The situation became more and more serious; Luiz Negreiros walking around more and more agitated, revolving his eyes in the orbits, as if he wanted to throw himself over his unhappy wife.",CO051CL09
16820,38,"She, with her elbows on her lap and her head on her hands, had her eyes pinned to the wall. The situation remained the same for a quarter of an hour. Luiz Negreiros was going to interrogate his wife again, when he heard his father-in-law’s voice, climbing up the stairs screaming:",CO051CL09
16821,39,"“Hey, Mr. Luiz! Hey, Mr. Little Rascal!”",CO051CL09
16822,40,"“Here comes your father,” Luiz Negreiros said. “You will soon pay me.”",CO051CL09
16823,41,"He left the sewing room to greet his father-in-law, who was already in the middle of the room, turning his hat in his hands with great risk to the jars and the chandelier.",CO051CL09
16824,42,"“Were you sleeping?” Mr. Meirelles asked, taking off his hat and wiping his forehead with a big and red scarf.",CO051CL09
16825,43,"“No, sir, we were talking…”",CO051CL09
16826,44,"“Talking?” Meirelles repeated in a very low voice.
And he said to himself:",CO051CL09
16827,45,“You were in a tiff… that’s what it is.”,CO051CL09
16828,46,"“We are going to have dinner” Luiz Negreiros said, “would you have dinner with us?”",CO051CL09
16829,47,"“I didn’t come here for anything else,” Meirelles said. “I will have dinner here today and tomorrow. You didn’t invite me, but that’s the same.”",CO051CL09
16830,48,“Didn’t I invite you?...”,CO051CL09
16831,49,"“Yes, isn’t it your birthday tomorrow?”",CO051CL09
16832,50,“Oh! that’s true…”,CO051CL09
16833,51,"There wasn’t an apparent reason for repeating these words, especially after saying them with a gloomy tone, but Luiz Negreiros repeated them with an extreme and intense happiness:",CO051CL09
16834,52,“Oh! that’s true!...”,CO051CL09
16835,53,"Meirelles, who was going to put his hat on a hanger in the hallway, was astounded when he turned back to his son-in-law, in whose face he saw the most sincere, sudden and inexplicable happiness.",CO051CL09
16836,54,“He’s crazy!” Meirelles said with a low voice.,CO051CL09
16837,55,"“Let’s have dinner,” the son-in-law said, going inside the house, while Meireles, following him in the hallway, went to the dining room.",CO051CL09
16838,56,Luiz Negreiros went to see his wife in the sewing room and found her arranging her hair in front of a small mirror:,CO051CL09
16839,57,"“Thank you,” he said when he entered.",CO051CL09
16840,58,The lady looked admiringly at him.,CO051CL09
16841,59,"“Thank you,” Luiz Negreiros repeated, “thank you and forgive me.”",CO051CL09
16842,60,"Having said this, he tried to embrace her, but she repelled her husband with a noble gesture and went to the dining room.",CO051CL09
16843,61,“She is right!” Luiz Negreiros murmured.,CO051CL09
16844,62,"Soon after this they were all at the dining table and the soup was served. As always, Meirelles thought it was icy. He was going to give a speech about the servers’ negligence, when Luiz Negreiros confessed that it was his fault, as there has been a long time since dinner was served.",CO051CL09
16845,63,"This declaration only changed the subject matter of the speech, which became a discussion on how terrible a reheated dinner could be, an idea which the poet had already summarized in this axiomatic verse: Un diner réchauffé ne valut jamais rien.",CO051CL09
16846,64,"Meirelles was a happy man, a joker, perhaps too frivolous for his age and for the position he occupied. Luiz Negreiros really liked to have him over for dinner.

16891,2,"I WILL NOW TELL YOU the story of the gold watch. It was a large chronometer, brand-new, and attached to an elegant chain. Luís Negreiros was quite right to be astonished when he saw the watch in his house, a watch that didn’t belong to him, and couldn’t possibly be his wife’s, either.",CO051CL10
16892,3,"An optical illusion? No. There it lay on the bedside table, looking at him, perhaps as amazed as he was by the place and the situation.",CO051CL10
16893,4,"Clarinha was not in the bedroom when Luís Negreiros entered. She was still in the parlor, leafing through a novel, and she barely responded to the kiss with which he greeted her when he arrived.",CO051CL10
16894,5,"Clarinha was a pretty young woman, although somewhat pale, or perhaps she was pretty precisely because she was pale. 
<NOT FULLY TRANSLATED>",CO051CL10
16895,6,"She lounged languidly on the sofa, her book open, her eyes on the book, but only her eyes, because I’m not sure her thoughts were also on the book, but, rather, elsewhere. In any case, she seemed equally indifferent to her husband and the watch.",CO051CL10
16896,7,"Luís Negreiros picked up the watch with a look on his face I do not even dare to describe. Neither the watch nor the chain were his, nor did they belong to anyone he knew. It was a riddle.",CO051CL10
16897,8,"Luís Negreiros liked riddles and was thought to be an intrepid solver of riddles; but he liked the kind you find in almanacs or in newspapers. He didn’t like physical or chronometrical riddles, especially not ones without any clues.",CO051CL10
16898,9,"For this and other obvious reasons, the reader will understand why Clarinha’s husband flung himself down in a chair, angrily tore at his hair, stamped his foot, and threw the watch and chain down on the table.",CO051CL10
16899,10,"Once this first outburst of rage was over, he again picked up the fateful object and examined it once more. He folded his arms and thought about the matter, scrutinized all his memories, and, at last, concluded that, without some explanation from Clarinha, any action he took would be either useless or precipitate.",CO051CL10
16900,11,He went to find her.,CO051CL10
16901,12,"Clarinha was just turning a page in her book with the calm, indifferent air of someone who is not puzzling over any chronometrical riddles. Luís Negreiros stared at her, his eyes like two shining daggers.",CO051CL10

16907,18,"Clarinha bit her lip and said nothing. Luís Negreiros stood for some time with the watch in his hand and his eyes fixed on his wife, who, in turn, had her eyes fixed on her book. There was a deep silence.",CO051CL10
16908,19,"Luís Negreiros was the first to break that silence, angrily hurling the watch to the floor and saying to his wife:",CO051CL10

16910,21,"Clarinha slowly raised her eyes to him, only to lower them again, murmuring:",CO051CL10

16912,23,"Luís Negreiros made a gesture as if he wanted to strangle her, but held back. She got to her feet, picked up the watch, and placed it on a small table. Unable to contain himself any longer, he walked over to her and grabbed her wrists, saying:",CO051CL10
16913,24,"“So, wretch, you won’t answer me, you won’t explain this enigma.”",CO051CL10
16914,25,"Clarinha winced, and Luís Negreiros immediately released his grip on her wrists. In different circumstances, he would probably have fallen at her feet and begged forgiveness for having hurt her. Just then, this didn’t even occur to him; he abandoned her in the middle of the parlor and recommenced his frantic pacing, stopping now and then as if he were pondering some possible tragic denouement.",CO051CL10

16919,30,"Luís Negreiros went looking for his wife and found her in a room set aside for sewing; she was sitting on a low chair, sobbing, her head in her hands. When she heard the sound of the door closing, she looked up, and he saw that her cheeks were wet with tears.",CO051CL10
16920,31,"This was an even worse situation for him than the one in the parlor. He could not bear to see a woman cry, still less his own wife. He was about to kiss away her tears, but stopped himself, went over to her, pulled up a chair, and sat down opposite her.",CO051CL10
16921,32,"“As you can see, I’m quite calm now,” he said, “just answer my question with your usual frankness. I’m not accusing you or suspecting you of anything. I simply want to know where that watch came from. Did your father leave it here?”",CO051CL10
16922,33,“No.”,CO051CL10
16923,34,“So where did it come from?”,CO051CL10

16925,36,"“This is too much!” roared Luís Negreiros, springing to his feet and sending the chair crashing to the floor.",CO051CL10
16926,37,"Clarinha shuddered and stayed where she was. The situation was becoming more and more serious; Luís Negreiros was again pacing up and down, growing increasingly agitated and wild-eyed, apparently ready to hurl himself on his poor wife.",CO051CL10
16927,38,"She was sitting with her elbows on her knees and her head in her hands, staring at the wall. Almost a quarter of an hour passed. Luís Negreiros was about to ask the same question when he heard his father-in-law’s booming voice coming up the steps:",CO051CL10
16928,39,"“Senhor Luís, where the devil have you got to?”",CO051CL10

16941,52,"“Yes, that’s right!”",CO051CL10
16942,53,"Meireles was just about to leave the room and hang his hat on a hatstand in the hallway, but, instead, he turned and stared in alarm at his son-in-law, on whose face he saw a look of frank, sudden, inexplicable joy.",CO051CL10
16943,54,“The fellow’s mad!” he muttered.,CO051CL10
16944,55,"“Let’s have supper,” roared Luís Negreiros, going inside, while Meireles, continuing down the hallway, made his way to the dining room.",CO051CL10

16950,61,"“Quite right too,” he murmured.",CO051CL10
16951,62,"Shortly afterward, all three were sitting around the dining table, and when the soup was served, it was, inevitably, stone-cold. Meireles was about to launch into a diatribe about negligent servants, when Luís Negreiros confessed that it was all his fault that supper had been on the table for so long.",CO051CL10
16952,63,"This declaration only slightly changed the topic of conversation, which then became a lament about the horror of the warmed-up supper, echoing Boileau’s words: un dîner réchauffé ne valut jamais rien.",CO051CL10
16953,64,"Meireles was a cheerful, jovial fellow, although possibly rather too flippant for a man his age, but he was, nonetheless, an interesting character. Luís Negreiros was very fond of him, and his affection was requited in a fatherly, friendly way, an affection that was all the more sincere considering that Meireles had only given him his daughter in marriage after much delay and some reluctance.",CO051CL10
16954,65,"They were courting for nearly four years, with Clarinha’s father taking more than two years to consider and resolve the matter of marriage. Finally, he gave his consent, swayed, he said, more by his daughter’s tears than by his son-in-law’s fine qualities.",CO051CL10
16955,66,"What lay behind that long hesitation were Luís Negreiros’s rather loose ways, not that he had indulged in these during their courtship, but he had before and might do so afterward. Meireles was the first to admit that he himself had been a far from exemplary husband, which is why he felt he should give his daughter a better husband than he had been.",CO051CL10
16956,67,"Luís Negreiros gave the lie to all his father-in-law’s fears; the impetuous lion of his youth became a meek little lamb. Friendship blossomed between father-in-law and son-in-law, and Clarinha became one of the most envied young women in the city.",CO051CL10
16957,68,"And Luís Negreiros deserved even more credit for this, because he did not lack for temptations. Sometimes the devil would get into one of his friends, who would invite Luís out to relive the old days. Luís Negreiros would always say that now he had found a safe harbor, he had no wish to risk setting sail again on the high seas.",CO051CL10
16958,69,"Clarinha loved her husband dearly and was the sweetest, gentlest creature to breathe the Rio air of her day. There was never the slightest disagreement between them; the clear conjugal sky was always the same and looked set to stay that way. What evil fate had blown in that first dark cloud?",CO051CL10
16959,70,"During supper, Clarinha said not a word, or only very occasionally, and then only briefly and abruptly.",CO051CL10
16960,71,"“They’ve obviously quarreled,” thought Meireles when he saw his daughter’s stubborn silence. “Or perhaps she’s just sulking, because he seems happy enough.”",CO051CL10
16961,72,"Luís Negreiros was indeed all gratitude, politeness, and sweet words to his wife, who would not even look at him. He inwardly cursed his father-in-law, longing to be left alone with his wife so that she could give him a full and final account of events that would restore peace between them. Clarinha did not appear to share this wish; she ate little and once or twice uttered a heartfelt sigh.",CO051CL10
16962,73,"It was clear that, however hard they tried, supper could not be as it was on other evenings.",CO051CL10
16963,74,"Meireles felt particularly uncomfortable, not because he feared there was some serious problem, for he was of the belief that without the odd quarrel one could not truly appreciate happiness, just as one needs a storm to fully appreciate fine weather.",CO051CL10
16964,75,"Nevertheless, it always upset him to see his daughter sad.",CO051CL10
16965,76,"When coffee was served, Meireles suggested that they all go to the theater. Luís Negreiros greeted the idea with enthusiasm. Clarinha refused point-blank.",CO051CL10
16966,77,"“I don’t know what’s wrong with you today, Clarinha,” said her father somewhat irritably. “Your husband seems perfectly cheerful, but you seem depressed and worried. Whatever’s wrong?”",CO051CL10
16967,78,"Clarinha did not answer, and, not knowing what to say, Luís Negreiros started making little balls out of the innards of what remained of a bread roll. Meireles shrugged.",CO051CL10
16968,79,"“Well, you’ll just have to sort it out between you,” he said. “And even though tomorrow is a special day, if you’re both still in this same strange mood, you won’t see hide nor hair of me.”",CO051CL10
16969,80,"“Oh, but you must come—” Luís Negreiros began, only to be interrupted by his wife bursting into tears.",CO051CL10
16970,81,"The supper ended on that sad, distressing note. Meireles asked his son-in-law to tell him what was going on, and Luís Negreiros promised that he would do so on a more opportune occasion.",CO051CL10
16971,82,"Shortly afterward, Meireles left, saying again that if they were in the same odd mood the following day, he would not be back, and that if there was one thing worse than a cold or warmed-up supper, it was one that gave you indigestion. This axiom was just as good as Boileau’s, but no one paid it any attention.",CO051CL10
16972,83,"Clarinha went to her room, and her husband joined her as soon as he had shown his father-in-law to the door. He found her sitting on the bed, sobbing, a pillow pressed to her face. Luís Negreiros knelt before her and took one of her hands.",CO051CL10
16973,84,"“Clarinha,” he said, “forgive me. I understand now. If your father hadn’t mentioned coming to supper tomorrow, it would never have occurred to me that the watch was your birthday present to me.”",CO051CL10
16974,85,"I will not even attempt to describe the proud, indignant look on the young woman’s face when she sprang to her feet on hearing these words. Luís Negreiros stared at her, uncomprehending. She said nothing, but stormed out of the room, leaving her poor husband more confused than ever.",CO051CL10
16975,86,"“What is this enigma?” Luís Negreiros was asking himself. “If it wasn’t a birthday present, then what other explanation can there be for that watch?”",CO051CL10
16976,87,"The situation was the same now as it had been before supper. Luís Negreiros determined that he would find out the truth that night. He thought it best, however, to give the matter mature consideration before reaching any firm conclusion.",CO051CL10
16977,88,"With this in mind, he went to his study, and there went over everything that had happened since he came home. He coolly weighed up every word, every incident, and tried to recall the changing expressions on his wife’s face during the evening.",CO051CL10
16978,89,"The look of indignation and revulsion when, in the sewing room, he had tried to embrace her, that counted in her favor; but the way she had bitten her lip when he showed her the watch, her tears at the supper table, and, more than anything else, her silence as to where the wretched object had come from, all those things counted against her.",CO051CL10
16979,90,"After much thought, Luís Negreiros tended toward the saddest and most deplorable of hypotheses.",CO051CL10
16980,91,"An evil idea began to drill its way into his mind, so deeply that, in a matter of moments, it had him entirely in its grasp. When the occasion called for it, Luís Negreiros could be very quick to anger. He uttered a few dark threats, then left his study and went to find his wife.",CO051CL10
16981,92,"Clarinha had gone back to her room. The door stood ajar. It was nine o’clock. The room was only dimly lit by a small lamp. She was again sitting on the bed, but not crying now; she kept her eyes fixed on the floor. She did not even look up when she heard her husband come in.",CO051CL10

17013,17,"Augusta was thirty years old and Adelaide was fifteen; but comparatively the mother looked younger than the daughter.

Adelaide reformed herself, and the day when this story starts she was already another girl; however, she was still quite far from Augusta.",CO026CL09
17027,31,A coach stopped at the front door at the moment Augusta was answering her daughter’s curious question about Vasconcellos’s occupations.,CO026CL09
17028,32,Adelaide ran to the window.,CO026CL09
17029,33,"“It’s Carlota, mom,” the girl said, turning round.",CO026CL09
17030,34,"A few minutes later aforementioned D. Carlota entered the living room. The readers will know this new character by the simple statement that she was a second volume of Augusta; beautiful, like her; elegant, like her; vain, like her. All this means that they were both the friendliest enemies that could be in this world.",CO026CL09
17031,35,"Carlota came to ask Augusta to go sing in a concert she was organizing in her house, which she dreamed up with the purpose of inaugurating a magnificent musical romance she had composed.",CO026CL09
17032,36,Augusta willingly accepted the request.,CO026CL09
17033,37,“How’s your husband?” she asked Carlota.,CO026CL09
17034,38,“He went to the Praça; and yours?”,CO026CL09
17035,39,“Mine is sleeping.”,CO026CL09
17036,40,"“Like a just man?” Carlota asked, smiling maliciously.",CO026CL09
17037,41,"“It seems,” Augusta answered.",CO026CL09
17038,42,"At this moment Adelaide, who had, by her mother’s request, gone to the piano to play a nocturne, went back to the group.",CO026CL09
17039,43,Augusta’s friend asked her:,CO026CL09
17040,44,“I bet you already have a fiancé in sight?”,CO026CL09
17041,45,The girl blushed and babbled:,CO026CL09
17042,46,“Don’t talk about that.”,CO026CL09
17043,47,"“Oh, you must have! Or it’s approaching the time when you’ll have a fiancé, and I already prophesy that he’ll be handsome…”",CO026CL09
17044,48,"“It’s too early,” Augusta said.",CO026CL09
17045,49,“Early?”,CO026CL09
17046,50,"“Yes, she’s too young; she will marry when the time comes, and time is far…”",CO026CL09
17047,51,"“I know,” Carlota said, laughing, “you want to prepare her well… I approve your intention. But in this case don’t take the dolls away from her.”",CO026CL09
17048,52,“She doesn’t have them anymore.”,CO026CL09
17049,53,“So it’s difficult to prevent the boyfriends. One thing replaces the other.”,CO026CL09
17050,54,"Augusta smiled, and Carlota stood up to go.",CO026CL09
17051,55,“Already?” Augusta said.,CO026CL09
17052,56,“I need to; goodbye!”,CO026CL09
17053,57,“Goodbye!”,CO026CL09
17054,58,"They exchanged some kisses, and Carlota left.",CO026CL09
17055,59,"A little later two door-to-door salesmen arrived: one with some dresses and the other with a novel; these had been ordered the day before. The dresses were really expensive, and the novel had the following title: Fanny, by Ernesto Feydeau.",CO026CL09
17056,60,II,CO026CL09
17057,61,That day Vasconcellos woke up around one in the afternoon.,CO026CL09
17058,62,"Vasconcellos was a forty-year-old man, good-looking and with a pair of wonderful gray-haired sideburns that gave him a diplomatic air, something he was a good hundred leagues far from being. He had a smiley and expansive face; his whole self breathed robust health.",CO026CL09
17059,63,"He had a good fortune and didn’t work, that is, he worked hard on the destruction of it, work in which his wife collaborated conscientiously.",CO026CL09
17060,64,Adelaide’s observation was true; Vasconcellos retired late; he always woke up after midday; and he left at the Ave Marias to return at dawn. Which meant he regularly made few short excursions to his family’s house.,CO026CL09
17061,65,"Augusta was the only person who had the right to demand from Vasconcellos a certain assiduity at home; but she never said anything to him. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t get along, as the husband, in compensation for her tolerance, didn’t deny his wife anything, and all her whims were rapidly satisfied.",CO026CL09
17062,66,"If it turned out that Vasconcellos couldn’t go with her to all the promenades and balls, his brother was entrusted to do so. He was a commander of two orders, an opposition politician, an excellent voltarete player, and a kind man in his spare time, which was very little.",CO026CL09
17063,67,"This brother, Lourenço, was what could be called a terrible brother. He obeyed all his sister-in-law’s desires, but didn’t save his brother from sermons. A good seed that didn’t thrive.",CO026CL09
17064,68,"Vasconcellos finally woke up, and in a good mood. The daughter was very cheerful when she saw him, and he showed great affability towards his wife, who reciprocated the same way.",CO026CL09
17065,69,"“Why do you wake up so late?” Adelaide asked, caressing Vasconcellos’s whiskers.",CO026CL09
17066,70,“Because I go to bed late.”,CO026CL09
17067,71,“But why do you go to bed late?”,CO026CL09
17068,72,"“Now you’re asking too much!” Vasconcellos said, smiling.",CO026CL09
17069,73,And he continued:,CO026CL09
17070,74,“I go to bed late because of the demands of my political necessities. You don’t know what politics is; it’s a very ugly but necessary thing.”,CO026CL09
17071,75,“I do know what politics is!” Adelaide said.,CO026CL09
17072,76,"“Ah! Then, explain to me what it is.”",CO026CL09
17073,77,"“In the country, when they broke the justice of the peace’s head, they said that it was because of politics; which I thought it was weird, because politics would not be to break the head…”",CO026CL09
17074,78,"Vasconcellos laughed a lot at his daughter’s observation and went to have lunch exactly upon the arrival of his brother, who couldn’t help exclaiming:",CO026CL09
17075,79,“Good time to have lunch!”,CO026CL09
17076,80,"“There you come with your reprimands. I have lunch when I’m hungry… Now you see if you want me to be a slave to the hours and denominations. Call it luncheon or lunch, the truth is that I’m eating.”",CO026CL09
17077,81,Lourenço replied with a grimace.,CO026CL09
17078,82,"When lunch was finished, Mr. Baptista’s arrival was announced. Vasconcellos welcomed him in his private office.",CO026CL09
17079,83,"Baptista was a young man of twenty-five; he was the perfect archetype of debauchery, an excellent companion at a dubious group’s supper but an inept guest in an honest group. He had wit and a certain intelligence, but it was necessary for him to be in a proper environment for these qualities to develop. All in all he was good-looking; he had a beautiful mustache; he wore Campas boots, and dressed in the most refined taste; he smoked as much as a soldier and as well as a lord.",CO026CL09
17080,84,"“I bet you just woke up?” Baptista said, entering Vasconcellos’s office.",CO026CL09
17081,85,“I’ve been awake for three quarters of an hour; I’ve just had lunch. Please take a cigar.”,CO026CL09
17082,86,Baptista accepted the cigar and stretched out in an Adirondack chair as Vasconcellos lighted a match.,CO026CL09
17083,87,“Have you seen Gomes?” Vasconcellos asked.,CO026CL09
17084,88,“I saw him yesterday. The great news is that he broke up with society.”,CO026CL09
17085,89,“Really?”,CO026CL09
17086,90,"“When I asked him why nobody had seen him in a month, he answered that he was undergoing a transformation, and that only memories will remain of the Gomes he used to be. It seems incredible, but he speaks with conviction.”",CO026CL09
17087,91,“I don’t believe it. He seems to be playing a joke on us. What’s new?”,CO026CL09
17088,92,"“Nothing; I mean, you might know something.”",CO026CL09
17089,93,“I know nothing…”,CO026CL09
17090,94,“Please! Didn’t you go to Jardim yesterday?”,CO026CL09
17091,95,"“Yes, I did. There was a dinner…”",CO026CL09
17092,96,"“Yes, a family party. I went to Alcazar. At what time did the meeting finish?”",CO026CL09
17093,97,“At four in the morning…”,CO026CL09
17094,98,"Vasconcellos stretched out on a hammock and the conversation continued in this tone, until a pickaninny came to tell him that Mr. Gomes was in the living room.",CO026CL09
17095,99,“That’s the man!” Baptista said.,CO026CL09
17096,100,"“Ask him to come upstairs,” Vasconcellos ordered.",CO026CL09
17097,101,"The boy went down to take the message; but Gomes appeared only a quarter of an hour later, as he spent some time downstairs talking to Augusta and Adelaide.",CO026CL09
17098,102,"“A bad penny always turns up,” Vasconcellos said when he saw the young man.",CO026CL09
17099,103,“You don’t come see me anymore…” he said.,CO026CL09
17100,104,"“I beg your pardon; I’ve been there twice already, and people told me you had gone out.”",CO026CL09
17101,105,"“This would be only for a great coincidence, because I never go out.”",CO026CL09
17102,106,“So then you became a complete hermit?”,CO026CL09
17103,107,"“I’m a chrysalis; I’ll reappear as a butterfly,” Gomes said, having a seat.",CO026CL09
17104,108,"“We have poetry… wait and see, Vasconcellos…”",CO026CL09
17105,109,"The new character, the so widely desired and hidden Gomes, looked like he was thirty years old. Gomes, Vasconcellos and Baptista were the trinity of pleasure and dissipation, linked by an indissoluble friendship.",CO026CL09
17106,110,"Everybody noticed when Gomes, around a month earlier, failed to appear in the usual social circles, but Vasconcellos and Baptista were the only ones who really felt his absence. However, they didn’t insist much upon pulling him out from loneliness, just out of consideration that this might be of his own interest.",CO026CL09
17107,111,"Therefore, Gomes was welcomed as a prodigal son.",CO026CL09
17108,112,“But where have you been? What is this chrysalis and butterfly thing? Be aware that I’m from the swamps.,CO026CL09
17109,113,"“That’s what I tell you, my friends. I’m sprouting wings.”",CO026CL09
17110,114,"“Wings!” Baptista said, stifling a laugh.",CO026CL09
17111,115,“Only if they are hawk wings to fall…”,CO026CL09
17112,116,"“No, I’m serious.”",CO026CL09
17113,117,And with effect Gomes was presenting a serious and conceited air.,CO026CL09
17114,118,Vasconcellos and Baptista looked at each other.,CO026CL09
17115,119,"“If what you’re saying is true, explain to us what your wings are for, and above all where you want to fly to.”",CO026CL09
17116,120,"Following Vasconcellos’s word, Baptista added:",CO026CL09
17117,121,"“Yes, you should give us an explanation, and we, your family council, will approve it if we think you have a good explanation; otherwise, your will have no wings, and you’ll still be what you have always been…”",CO026CL09
17118,122,"“You have my support,” Vasconcellos said.",CO026CL09
17119,123,"“That’s simple: I’m sprouting wings of love, and I want to fly to love’s heaven.”",CO026CL09
17120,124,“Love!” Gomes’s friends said.,CO026CL09
17121,125,"“That’s true,” Gomes continued. “What have I been until now? A true reveler, a perfect joker, spending my money and my heart generously. But is this enough to fill a life? Apparently not...”",CO026CL09
17122,126,"“Up to there, I agree with you… it’s not enough; other things are also necessary; the difference consists in the way we…”",CO026CL09
17123,127,"“It’s true, Vasconcellos, it’s true, it’s natural that you think in a different way, but I think I’m right to say that life is pure desert without a pure and chaste love.”",CO026CL09
17124,128,Baptista jumped...,CO026CL09
17125,129,Vasconcellos stared at Gomes.,CO026CL09
17126,130,“I bet you’re going to get married?” he said.,CO026CL09
17127,131,"“I don’t know if I’m going to get married; I know I’m in love, and I wait to end up marrying the woman who I love.”",CO026CL09
17128,132,“Getting married!” Baptista exclaimed.,CO026CL09
17129,133,And he let out a strident laugh.,CO026CL09
17130,134,But Gomes spoke so seriously and insisted so seriously in those projects of regeneration that the two friends finally listened to him with similar gravity.,CO026CL09
17131,135,Gomes spoke a strange language that was entirely new on the lips of a young man who was the craziest and noisiest in the parties of Bacchus and Kythera.,CO026CL09
17132,136,“Are you really leaving us?” Vasconcellos asked.,CO026CL09
17133,137,"“Me? Yes and no; you’ll meet me at the saloons; but in the hotels and houses of ill repute, never more.”",CO026CL09
17134,138,“De profundis…” Baptista hummed.,CO026CL09
17135,139,"“But after all,” Vasconcellos said, “where’s your Marion? Can we know who she is?”",CO026CL09
17136,140,"“It’s not Marion, it’s Virgínia… Pure congeniality at first, then pronounced affection, now true passion. I fought as much as I could; but I dropped my weapons before a stronger force.",CO026CL09
17137,141,"My great fear was not having a soul to offer this gentle creature. Now I have it, and it’s so high-spirited and as virgin as it was when I was eighteen. Only the chaste gaze of a virgin could discover this divine pearl in my sludge. I’m reborn better than I was....",CO026CL09
17138,142,"“It’s clear, Vasconcellos, the young man is insane; let’s send him to Praia Vermelha; and since he might have a fit, I’m leaving…”",CO026CL09
17139,143,Baptista got his hat.,CO026CL09
17140,144,“Where are you going?” Gomes said.,CO026CL09
17141,145,“I’ve got something to do; but I’ll soon come to your house; I want to see if there’s still time to drag you back from this abyss.”,CO026CL09
17142,146,And he left.,CO026CL09
17143,147,III,CO026CL09
17144,148,The two men were alone.,CO026CL09
17145,149,"“So, is it true you’re in love?”",CO026CL09
17146,150,"“I am. I knew you both would hardly believe it; I myself still don’t believe it, and, nevertheless, it’s true. I finish where you start. Would it be better or worse? I believe it’s better.”",CO026CL09
17147,151,“Are you interested in hiding the person’s name?”,CO026CL09
17148,152,“I’m hiding it from everyone except from you.”,CO026CL09
17149,153,“That’s proof of trust…”,CO026CL09
17150,154,Gomes smiled.,CO026CL09
17151,155,"“No,” he said, “it’s a sine qua non condition; before everybody else, you must know who was chosen by my heart; it’s your daughter.”",CO026CL09
17152,156,"“Adelaide?” Vasconcellos asked, scared.",CO026CL09
17153,157,"“Yes, your daughter.”",CO026CL09
17154,158,Gomes’s revelation fell like a bomb. Vasconcellos not even by far had suspected such a thing.,CO026CL09
17155,159,“Do you approve of this love?” Gomes asked him.,CO026CL09
17156,160,"Vasconcellos reflected, and after some minutes of silence he said:",CO026CL09
17157,161,"“My heart approves your choice; you’re my friend, you’re in love, and once she loves you…”",CO026CL09
17158,162,"Gomes was going to talk, but Vasconcellos kept smiling:",CO026CL09
17159,163,“But what about society?”,CO026CL09
17160,164,“Which society?”,CO026CL09
17161,165,"“The society that sees us as libertines, you and me, and it’s natural that it doesn’t approve what I do.”",CO026CL09
17162,166,"“I already see that it’s a refusal,” Gomes said, becoming upset.",CO026CL09
17163,167,"“What refusal, goofy! It’s an objection you could destroy by saying: society is a great slanderer and a famous prier. My daughter is yours, but I have one condition.”",CO026CL09
17164,168,“Which one?”,CO026CL09
17165,169,“Reciprocity. Does she love you?”,CO026CL09
17166,170,"“I don’t know,” Gomes answered.",CO026CL09
17167,171,“But do you suspect…”,CO026CL09
17168,172,"“I don’t know. I know that I love her and that I would give my life for her, but I don’t know if I’m reciprocated.”",CO026CL09
17169,173,“You will be... I’ll test the water. I’ll give you my answer in two days. Oh! I’ll see you become my son-in-law!”,CO026CL09
17170,174,Gomes replied by falling in his arms. The scene bordered on comedy when the clock struck three in the afternoon. Gomes remembered he had a rendezvous with a friend; Vasconcellos remembered he had to write a few letters.,CO026CL09
17171,175,Gomes left the house without talking to the ladies.,CO026CL09
17172,176,"At around four o’clock Vasconcellos was ready to go out, when a visit by Mr. José Brito was announced.",CO026CL09
17173,177,The joyful Vasconcellos frowned when he heard this name.,CO026CL09
17174,178,"Shortly thereafter, Mr. José Brito entered the office.",CO026CL09
17175,179,"For Vasconcellos, Mr. José Brito was a real ghost, an echo from the abyss, a voice of reality; he was a creditor.",CO026CL09
17176,180,"“I wasn’t expecting your visit today,” Vasconcellos said.",CO026CL09
17177,181,"“I’m surprised,” Mr. José Brito replied with stabbing tranquility, “because today is the 21st.”",CO026CL09
17178,182,"“I thought it was the 19th,” Vasconcellos muttered.",CO026CL09
17179,183,"“The 19th was the day before yesterday, but today is the 21st. Look,” the creditor said, taking Jornal do Commercio, which was on a chair, “Thursday, he 21st.”",CO026CL09
17180,184,“Did you come to collect the money?”,CO026CL09
17181,185,"“Here you have the letter of credit,” Mr. José Brito said, taking the wallet from his pocket and a piece of paper from the wallet.",CO026CL09
17182,186,"“Why didn’t you come earlier?” Vasconcellos asked, seeking to space out the main topic of the conversation.",CO026CL09
17183,187,"“I came at eight,” the creditor answered, “you were sleeping; the same happened when I came at nine, ditto; at ten, ditto; at eleven, ditto, I came at midday, ditto. I wanted to come at one, but I had to send a man to prison, and I couldn’t finish this job earlier. I had lunch at three, and I’m here at four.”",CO026CL09
17184,188,Vasconcellos pulled out a cigar to see if he had a good idea to get out of the payment he wasn’t counting on.,CO026CL09
17185,189,"He wasn’t able to come up with any ideas, but the creditor provided him with an opportunity.",CO026CL09
17186,190,"“Besides,” he said, “the time doesn’t matter because I was sure you would pay me.”",CO026CL09
17187,191,"“Ah!” Vasconcellos said, “maybe it’s a mistake; I wasn’t expecting you today, and I didn’t get the money…”",CO026CL09
17188,192,"“So, how’s it going to be?” the creditor asked with naivety.",CO026CL09
17189,193,Vasconcellos felt hope penetrating his soul.,CO026CL09
17190,194,"“Nothing simpler,” he said, “you wait until tomorrow…”",CO026CL09
17191,195,"“Tomorrow I can’t, as I want to watch the garnishment of a man I sued for a large debt…”",CO026CL09
17192,196,“Pardon me; I’ll take the money to your house.”,CO026CL09
17193,197,"“It would be good if commercial business were arranged so. If we were two friends, it would be natural that I content myself with your promise, and all would be over tomorrow; but I’m your creditor, and I only have a view of saving my interests… Therefore, I think it would be better you pay me today…”",CO026CL09
17194,198,Vasconcellos ran his hand through his hair.,CO026CL09
17195,199,"“But if I don’t have the money,” he said.",CO026CL09
17196,200,"“It’s something that must bother you very much, but it doesn’t make the slightest impression on me… That is, it should make some impression on me, because your situation is precarious today.”",CO026CL09
17197,201,“Mine?”,CO026CL09
17198,202,"“That’s true; your houses at Rua da Imperatriz are all mortgaged; the one at Rua de São Pedro has been sold, and the amount paid already has already gone away; your slaves have been going one by one, without you noticing; and the expenses you’ve just made to furnish a house for a certain lady from the equivocal society are immense. I know everything… I know more than you do...”",CO026CL09
17199,203,Vasconcellos was visibly frightened.,CO026CL09
17200,204,The creditor was telling the truth.,CO026CL09
17201,205,"“But anyway,” Vasconcellos said, “what shall we do?”",CO026CL09
17202,206,"“A simple thing: we double the debt, and you put down a deposit right now.”",CO026CL09
17203,207,“Double the debt! But that’s a…”,CO026CL09
17204,208,"“This is a lifeline; I’m going easy on you. Come on, accept it. Write me the deposit, and we tear the letter to pieces.”",CO026CL09
17205,209,Vasconcellos still wanted to object; but it was impossible to convince Mr. José Brito.,CO026CL09
17206,210,He signed a deposit of eighteen contos.,CO026CL09
17207,211,"When the creditor left, Vasconcellos began to seriously meditate on his life.",CO026CL09
17208,212,"Until then he had spent so much money, and so blindly, that he didn’t notice the abyss he himself had dug under his feet.",CO026CL09
17209,213,"The voice of one of his tormentors, however, came to warn him.",CO026CL09
17210,214,"Vasconcellos reflected, calculated, recapitulated his expenses and his obligations, and saw that he had less than a fourth of the fortune he used to have.
To live as he had hitherto lived, that was nothing less than absolute poverty.",CO026CL09
17211,215,What to do in such situation?,CO026CL09
17212,216,Vasconcellos took his hat and left.,CO026CL09
17213,217,Night was falling.,CO026CL09
17214,218,"After walking on the street for some time, surrendered to his meditations, Vasconcellos entered Alcazar.",CO026CL09
17215,219,It was a way to distract himself.,CO026CL09
17216,220,He would find the usual society there.,CO026CL09
17217,221,Baptista came to meet his friend.,CO026CL09
17218,222,“Why that face?” he said.,CO026CL09
17219,223,"“It’s nothing, someone stepped on my toes,” Vasconcellos replied, as he couldn’t find a better answer.",CO026CL09
17220,224,"But a pedicurist who was next to them listened to what he said, and never took his eyes off the unhappy Vasconcellos, whom the most indifferent thing bothered. The pedicurist’s persistent look annoyed him so much that Vasconcellos left.",CO026CL09
17221,225,He went to the Milan Hotel for dinner. The demands of his stomach didn’t linger despite his concerns.,CO026CL09
17222,226,"Well, in the middle of dinner he remembered something that couldn’t have left his mind: Gomes’s wedding proposal that afternoon.",CO026CL09
17223,227,It was a ray of light.,CO026CL09
17224,228,"“Gomes is rich,” Vasconcellos thought, “this is the way to escape the greatest grief; Gomes marries Adelaide, and as he’s my friend he won’t deny the help I need. I’ll try to win what’s lost if it depends on me… What good fortune was the recollection of the wedding!”",CO026CL09
17225,229,"Vasconcellos ate joyfully; afterwards he returned to Alcazar, where some young men and other people made him completely forget his misfortunes.",CO026CL09
17226,230,At three in the morning Vasconcellos entered his house with his usual tranquility and regularity.,CO026CL09
17227,231,IV,CO026CL09
17228,232,"The following day Vasconcellos’s first concern was to check on Adelaide’s heart. However, he wanted to do so when Augusta was absent. Fortunately she needed to go to Rua da Quitanda20 to see some new fabrics, and she went out with her brother-in-law, leaving Vasconcellos completely free.",CO026CL09
17229,233,"As the readers already know, Adelaide liked her father very much and was willing to do everything for him. She had, moreover, an excellent heart. Vasconcellos was counting on these two forces.",CO026CL09
17230,234,"“Come here, Adelaide,” he said, entering the living room, “do you know how old you are?”",CO026CL09
17231,235,“I’m fifteen.”,CO026CL09
17232,236,“Do you know how old is your mother?”,CO026CL09
17233,237,"“Twenty-seven, isn’t she?”",CO026CL09
17234,238,“She’s thirty; it means she got married when she was fifteen.”,CO026CL09
17235,239,"Vasconcellos stopped, in order to see the effect produced by these words; but his expectation was useless; Adelaide didn’t understand anything.",CO026CL09
17236,240,The father continued:,CO026CL09
17237,241,“Haven’t you thought about marriage?”,CO026CL09
17238,242,"The girl blushed a lot and hesitated to speak, but at her father’s urging, she replied:",CO026CL09
17239,243,"“Why, dad! I don’t want to get married.”",CO026CL09
17240,244,“You don’t! That’s a good one! Why?”,CO026CL09
17241,245,"“Because I don’t feel such desire, and I live well here.”",CO026CL09
17242,246,“But you can get married and continue to live here…”,CO026CL09
17243,247,“Well; but I don’t have such desire.”,CO026CL09
17244,248,“Come on... Confess to me that you are in love with someone.”,CO026CL09
17245,249,"“Don’t you ask me that, dad… I’m not in love with anyone.”",CO026CL09
17246,250,Adelaide’s speech was so sincere that Vasconcellos couldn’t doubt it.,CO026CL09
17247,251,"“She speaks the truth,” he thought, “it’s useless to try it this way.”",CO026CL09
17248,252,"Adelaide sat at his feet, and said:",CO026CL09
17249,253,"“So, daddy, let’s not talk about that anymore…”",CO026CL09
17250,254,"“We will, my daughter; you’re a child, you don’t know how to calculate things. Imagine if your mother and I die tomorrow. Who will support you? Only a husband.”",CO026CL09
17251,255,“But what if I don’t like anyone…”,CO026CL09
17252,256,"“That’s for a while; but you’ll come around to come to like a fiancé who is good-looking and good-hearted… I’ve already chosen one who loves you very much, and whom you’ll love too.”",CO026CL09
17253,257,Adelaide shivered.,CO026CL09
17254,258,"“Loves me?” she said, “But… who is he?”",CO026CL09
17255,259,“It’s Gomes.”,CO026CL09
17256,260,"“I don’t love him, my father.”",CO026CL09
17257,261,"“Now, I believe it; but you can’t deny that he’s worthy of being loved. Within two months you’ll be in love with him.”",CO026CL09
17258,262,"Adelaide didn’t say a word. She bowed her head and began twisting one of her thick, black plaits in her fingers. Her chest was heaving strongly; the girl had her eyes fixed on the carpet.",CO026CL09
17259,263,"“Come on, it’s decided, right?” Vasconcellos asked.",CO026CL09
17260,264,"“But daddy, and if I am unhappy?…”",CO026CL09
17261,265,"“That’s impossible my daughter; you’ll be very happy, and you’ll love your husband very much.”",CO026CL09
17262,266,"“Oh! Daddy,” Adelaide said with her eyes full of tears, “I ask you not to marry me yet…”",CO026CL09
17263,267,"“Adelaide, the first duty of a daughter is to obey her father, and I’m your father. I want you to marry Gomes; and you shall.”",CO026CL09
17264,268,"These words, to have any effect, should be followed by a quick withdrawal. Vasconcellos understood this, and left the living room leaving Adelaide in the most complete desolation.",CO026CL09
17265,269,Adelaide wasn’t in love with anybody. Her refusal wasn’t based on having another love; it also wasn’t the result of an aversion for her suitor.,CO026CL09
17266,270,The girl felt absolute disinterest in the young man.,CO026CL09
17267,271,Under these conditions the marriage was nothing more than an odious imposition.,CO026CL09
17268,272,But what would Adelaide do? To whom would she resort?,CO026CL09
17269,273,She resorted to tears.,CO026CL09
17270,274,"As for Vasconcellos, he went to his office and wrote his future son-in-law the following lines:",CO026CL09
17271,275,"Everything goes well; I authorize you to court the little one, and I hope the marriage to be concluded in two months.",CO026CL09
17272,276,He closed the letter and sent it.,CO026CL09
17273,277,Augusta and Lourenço returned home shortly after that.,CO026CL09
17274,278,"While Augusta went to the dressing room to change her clothes, Lourenço went to talk to Adelaide, who was in the garden.",CO026CL09
17275,279,He noticed that her eyes were red from crying and questioned her the cause; but the girl denied it was from crying.,CO026CL09
17276,280,"Lourenço didn’t believe his niece’s words, and urged her to tell him what was happening.",CO026CL09
17277,281,"Adelaide had a great confidence in her uncle, even because of the roughness of his manners. After a few minutes of insistence, Adelaide told Lourenço her quarrel with her father.",CO026CL09
17278,282,"“So, is that why are you crying, little one?”",CO026CL09
17279,283,“So? How can I escape marriage?”,CO026CL09
17280,284,"“Don’t worry, you won’t get married; I promise you shall not get married…”",CO026CL09
17281,285,The young lady felt a thrill of joy.,CO026CL09
17282,286,"“Do you promise me, my uncle, that you will convince my father?”",CO026CL09
17283,287,"“I shall defeat or convince him, it doesn’t matter; you won’t get married. Your father is a fool.”",CO026CL09
17284,288,"Lourenço went up to Vasconcellos’s office, exactly at the moment he was about to leave.",CO026CL09
17285,289,“Are you going out?” Lourenço asked.,CO026CL09
17286,290,"“Yes, I am.”",CO026CL09
17287,291,“I need to talk to you.”,CO026CL09
17288,292,"Lourenço sat down, and Vasconcellos, who already had the hat on his head, stood up waiting for him to speak.",CO026CL09
17289,293,"“Sit down,” Lourenço said.",CO026CL09
17290,294,Vasconcellos sat down.,CO026CL09
17291,295,“For sixteen years …”,CO026CL09
17292,296,"“You start from long ago; see if you can abbreviate a half dozen years, otherwise I can’t promise I’ll listen to what you’re going to tell me.”",CO026CL09
17293,297,"“For sixteen years,” Lourenço continued, you’ve been married, but the difference between the first day and today is great.”",CO026CL09
17294,298,"“This is natural,” Vasconcellos said. “Tempora mutantur et...”",CO026CL09
17295,299,"“At that time,” Lourenço said, “you used to say that you had found heaven, the true heaven, and for two or three years you were the model husband. Then you changed completely; and heaven would turn into a complete hell if your wife wasn’t as dispassionate and cold as she is, thus avoiding the most terrible domestic scenes.”",CO026CL09
17296,300,"“But Lourenço, what do you have to do with it?”",CO026CL09
17297,301,"“Nothing; and I’m not going to talk to you about that. What interests me is that you don’t sacrifice your daughter because of a whim, handing her over to one of your fellow libertines…”",CO026CL09
17298,302,Vasconcellos stood up.,CO026CL09
17299,303,“You’re crazy!” he said.,CO026CL09
17300,304,"“I’m calm, and I’m giving you this wise advice: don’t sacrifice your daughter to a libertine.”",CO026CL09
17301,305,"“Gomes isn’t a libertine; it’s true that he had a common young man’s life, but he likes Adelaide and has reformed completely. It’s a good marriage, and so I think we should all accept it. It’s my will, and in this house, I’m the boss.”",CO026CL09
17302,306,"Lourenço still tried to speak, but Vasconcellos was already off.",CO026CL09
17303,307,“What to do?” Lourenço thought.,CO026CL09
17304,308,V,CO026CL09
17305,309,"Lourenço’s opposition didn’t make a great impression on Vasconcellos. It’s true that he could suggest ideas of resistance to his niece; but Adelaide, who had a weak spirit, would give in to the last one who spoke to her, and the advice given on one day would be overcome by imposition of the next day.",CO026CL09
17306,310,"However, it was advantageous to get Augusta’s support. Vasconcellos thought of dealing with it as soon as possible.",CO026CL09
17307,311,"Meanwhile it was urgent to organize his business, and Vasconcellos sought a lawyer to whom he handed all the papers and information, trusting him with guidance about all the necessities of the situation, by which means he could oppose any case of claim for debt or mortgage.",CO026CL09
17308,312,None of this meant that Vasconcellos would change his habits. He was only getting ready to continue his previous life.,CO026CL09
17309,313,"Two days after the conversation with his brother, Vasconcellos went to talk to Augusta, in order to frankly discuss Adelaide’s marriage.",CO026CL09
17310,314,"During this interval the fiancé, obeying Vasconcellos’s advice, was already courting Adelaide. It was possible that, if the marriage wasn’t imposed, Adelaide would end up liking the young man. Gomes was an elegant, good-looking young man; and moreover, he knew all the strategies that should be used to impress a woman.",CO026CL09
17311,315,Would Augusta have noticed the young man’s assiduous presence? Vasconcellos was asking this question to his soul when he entered his wife’s dressing room.,CO026CL09
17312,316,“Are you going out?” he asked.,CO026CL09
17313,317,“No; I have some visitors.”,CO026CL09
17314,318,“Ah! Who?”,CO026CL09
17315,319,"“Seabra’s wife,” she said.",CO026CL09
17316,320,"Vasconcellos sat down, and sought a way to start the special conversation which had led him there.",CO026CL09
17317,321,“You look very beautiful today!”,CO026CL09
17318,322,"“Really?” she said smiling. “I look the same as ever, and it’s strange that you say that today…”",CO026CL09
17319,323,"“No; really, today you’re more beautiful than usual, to the point that I can be jealous.”",CO026CL09
17320,324,“What!” Augusta said with an ironic smile.,CO026CL09
17321,325,"Vasconcellos scratched his head, took off his watch and wound it up; then, he began to pull his beard, took out a sheet of paper, read two or three advertisements, threw the sheet on the floor and at last, after an already long silence, Vasconcellos thought it would be better to assault the fortress head on.",CO026CL09
17322,326,"“I’ve been thinking about Adelaide lately,” he said.",CO026CL09
17323,327,“Ah! Why?”,CO026CL09
17324,328,“She’s a young lady…”,CO026CL09
17325,329,“Young lady?” Augusta exclaimed. “She’s a child.”,CO026CL09
17326,330,“She’s older than you were when you got married…”,CO026CL09
17327,331,Augusta frowned slightly.,CO026CL09
17328,332,“But then…” she said.,CO026CL09
17329,333,"“Then that I want is to make her happy, and happy for the marriage. A young man, worthy of her in every respect, asked me for her days ago and I said ‘yes.’ You’ll approve the choice when you know who he is: it’s Gomes. We will marry her, won’t we?”",CO026CL09
17330,334,“No!” Augusta answered.,CO026CL09
17331,335,“Why not?”,CO026CL09
17332,336,"“Adelaide is a child; she isn’t sensible, and her age isn’t appropriate. She will get married when the time is right.”",CO026CL09
17333,337,“When the time is right? Are you sure that the bridegroom will wait until the time is right?”,CO026CL09
17334,338,"“Patience,” Augusta said.",CO026CL09
17335,339,“Do you have any problems with Gomes?”,CO026CL09
17336,340,"“No, he’s a distinguished young man; but he’s not appropriate for Adelaide.”",CO026CL09
17337,341,"Vasconcellos hesitated to continue; it seemed that nothing could be arranged; but the idea of the fortune gave him strength, and he asked:",CO026CL09
17338,342,“Why?”,CO026CL09
17339,343,"“Are you sure he suits Adelaide?” Augusta asked, eluding her husband’s question.",CO026CL09
17340,344,“I say that he suits her.”,CO026CL09
17341,345,"“Suitable or not, the little one shouldn’t get married now.”",CO026CL09
17342,346,“And if she loved him…?”,CO026CL09
17343,347,“What does it matter? She would wait!”,CO026CL09
17344,348,"“But Augusta, we can’t do without this marriage… It’s a fatal necessity.”",CO026CL09
17345,349,“Fatal? I don’t understand.”,CO026CL09
17346,350,“I’ll explain myself. Gomes has a great fortune.”,CO026CL09
17347,351,“We also have a…”,CO026CL09
17348,352,"“That’s your mistake,” Vasconcellos interrupted.",CO026CL09
17349,353,“What do you mean?”,CO026CL09
17350,354,Vasconcellos continued:,CO026CL09
17351,355,"“You would find out sooner or later, and I appreciate having the opportunity to tell you the whole truth. The truth is that, if we aren’t poor, we’re ruined.”",CO026CL09
17352,356,"Augusta heard these words with scared eyes. When he finished, she said:",CO026CL09
17353,357,“It’s not possible!”,CO026CL09
17354,358,“Unfortunately it’s true!”,CO026CL09
17355,359,This was followed by a moment of silence.,CO026CL09
17356,360,"“It’s all arranged,” Vasconcellos thought.",CO026CL09
17357,361,Augusta broke the silence:,CO026CL09
17358,362,"“But,” she said, “if our fortune is shattered, I think you have better things to do than be talking; you must rebuild it.”",CO026CL09
17359,363,"Vasconcellos made a gesture of astonishment with his head, and, as if the gesture were a question, Augusta was quick to answer:",CO026CL09
17360,364,“Don’t be surprised; I believe that it’s your duty to rebuild the fortune.”,CO026CL09
17361,365,"“I’m not surprised with that obligation, I’m surprised at the way you’re reminding me of it, as if it were my fault…”",CO026CL09
17362,366,"“Well!” Augusta said, “are you going to say it was me…”",CO026CL09
17363,367,"“The blame, if there’s blame, is on us both.”",CO026CL09
17364,368,“Why? Is it also mine?”,CO026CL09
17365,369,"“Yes. Your crazy spending contributed largely to this result; I never refused and I don’t refuse you anything, and that’s what I’m guilty of. If that’s what you rub in my face, I accept.”",CO026CL09
17366,370,Augusta shrugged with contempt; and laid a look on Vasconcellos with such scorn that it would be enough to bring a divorce action.,CO026CL09
17367,371,Vasconcellos saw the movement and the look.,CO026CL09
17368,372,"“The love for luxury and the superfluous,” he said, “will always produce these consequences. They’re terrible but explainable. To conjure them up it would be necessary to live with moderation. You never thought about that. At the end of six months of marriage you began to live in the whirlwind of fashion, and the small stream of expenses turned into an immense river of waste.",CO026CL09
17369,373,You know what my brother said to me once? That the idea of sending Adelaide to the country was suggested to you for the necessity of living without any type of caring.”,CO026CL09
17370,374,Augusta had stood up and took a few steps; she was shaky and pale.,CO026CL09
17371,375,"Vasconcellos was going on in his recriminations when his wife interrupted him, saying:",CO026CL09
17372,376,“But why didn’t you stop the expenses I made?”,CO026CL09
17373,377,“Domestic peace was what I wanted.”,CO026CL09
17374,378,"“No!” she cried out. “For your part you wanted to have a free and independent life, sir; you imagined you were buying your tolerance with mine when you saw I was indulging in these expenses. That’s the only reason; your life isn’t similar to mine, but it’s worse… If my expenses were made at home, yours were made outside of it, sir…",CO026CL09
17375,379,"It’s useless to deny it, because I know everything; I know the name of all the rivals you successively gave me, sir; and I never said a word to you, and I don’t blame you now, because it would be worthless and too late.”",CO026CL09
17376,380,"The situation had changed. Vasconcellos had begun as a judge and turned into a co-defendant. It was impossible to deny, and arguing was risky and useless. He preferred to cavil.",CO026CL09
17377,381,"“If this was so (and I won’t argue about it), in any case we’re both to blame, and I don’t see any reasons for rubbing it in my face. I agree I should repair the fortune; there’s a way; and this is it: the marriage between Adelaide and Gomes.”",CO026CL09
17378,382,"“No,” Augusta said.",CO026CL09
17379,383,"“Well, we’ll be poor, and we’ll be worse than we are now; we’ll sell everything…”",CO026CL09
17380,384,"“I beg your pardon,” Augusta said, “I don’t know why you, sir, who are strong and have the greater share in the disaster, shouldn’t employ your efforts for the reconstruction of the destroyed fortune.”",CO026CL09
17381,385,"“It’s a long project; and from here to then life goes on and we keep spending. The way out, I told you: to marry Adelaide to Gomes.”",CO026CL09
17382,386,“I don’t want it!” Augusta said. “I don’t consent to such a marriage.”,CO026CL09
17383,387,"Vasconcellos was going to reply, but Augusta had left the office hastily soon after uttering these words.",CO026CL09
17384,388,Vasconcellos left a few minutes later.,CO026CL09
17385,389,VI,CO026CL09
17386,390,"Lourenço didn’t have any knowledge about the scene between his brother and his sister-in-law, and after Vasconcellos’s stubbornness he decided he wasn’t going to say anything else. However, as he liked his niece very much and didn’t want to see her in the hands of a man whose habits he disapproved of, Lourenço waited for the situation to assume a more decisive nature in order to take a more active role.",CO026CL09
17387,391,"But, in order not to lose time, and to be able to use some powerful weapon, Lourenço initiated research through which he could gather detailed information about Gomes.",CO026CL09
17388,392,"This one supposed that the marriage was something decided, and he didn’t lose time in the winning of Adelaide’s heart.",CO026CL09
17389,393,"He noticed, however, that Augusta became colder and more indifferent without any apparent reason, and the suspicion that she was opposing the marriage entered his spirit.",CO026CL09
17390,394,"As for Vasconcellos, discouraged by the scene in the dressing room, he waited for better days, and counted, above all, on necessity prevailing.",CO026CL09
17391,395,"One day, however, exactly forty-eight hours after the heated discussion with Augusta, Vasconcellos asked himself this question:",CO026CL09
17392,396,“Augusta refuses Gomes’s proposal to Adelaide; why?”,CO026CL09
17393,397,"From question to question, deduction to deduction, a field for painful suspicion opened in Vasconcellos’s spirit.",CO026CL09
17394,398,“Does she love him?” he asked himself.,CO026CL09
17395,399,"Then, as if the abyss attracted the abyss, and one suspicion claimed another, Vasconcellos asked:",CO026CL09
17396,400,“Would they have loved each other for a while?”,CO026CL09
17397,401,"For the first time, Vasconcellos felt the serpent of jealousy biting his heart.",CO026CL09
17398,402,I say jealousy as a euphemism; I don’t know if it was jealousy; it was offended pride.,CO026CL09
17399,403,Would Vasconcellos’s suspicions be right?,CO026CL09
17400,404,"I must tell the truth: they weren’t. Augusta was vain but faithful to her unfaithful husband for two reasons: her conscience and her temperament. Even if she wasn’t convinced of her wifely duty, it’s certain that she would never betray her marital oath.",CO026CL09
17401,405,"She wasn’t made for passions other than the ridiculous passions imposed by vanity. She loved her own beauty above all; her best friend would be the one who told her she was the most beautiful amongst all women; she would give her friendship, but she would never give her heart, and that’s what saved her.",CO026CL09
17402,406,"That is the truth; but who would tell Vasconcellos? Once suspicious that his honor was affected, he began to recapitulate his whole life. Gomes has been visiting his house for six years and had complete freedom in it.",CO026CL09
17403,407,"Betrayal was easy. Vasconcellos began to remember the words, gestures, looks, all that had previously seemed uninerested in him. They now took on a suspicious character.",CO026CL09
17404,408,"Vasconcellos was full of this thought for two days. He didn’t leave his house. When Gomes arrived, he observed his wife with unusual persistence; her coldness when welcoming the young man was, in her husband’s eyes, a proof of the offense.",CO026CL09
17405,409,"He was thinking so when on the morning of the third day (Vasconcellos was already waking up earlier), his brother entered the office with his usual wild air.",CO026CL09
17406,410,Lourenço’s presence inspired in Vasconcellos the idea to tell him everything.,CO026CL09
17407,411,Lourenço was a man of common sense and supportive in case of need.,CO026CL09
17408,412,"The brother listened to everything Vasconcellos said and, once he concluded, he broke his silence with these words:",CO026CL09
17409,413,"“All you said is foolishness; if your wife refuses the marriage, that’s for any reason other than this.”",CO026CL09
17410,414,“But she refuses Adelaide’s marriage to Gomes.”,CO026CL09
17411,415,"“Yes, because you told her that the suitor is Gomes; she might refuse the same way if you talked about someone else. There must be another reason; maybe Adelaide told her, and asked her to oppose, because your daughter doesn’t love the young man and can’t marry him.”",CO026CL09
17412,416,“She won’t.”,CO026CL09
17413,417,"“It’s not only because of that, but also because...”",CO026CL09
17414,418,“Finish it.”,CO026CL09
17415,419,“Because such a marriage is Gomes’s speculation.”,CO026CL09
17416,420,“Speculation?” Vasconcellos asked.,CO026CL09
17417,421,"“Like yours,” Lourenço said. “You give your daughter with your eyes on his fortune; he accepts her with his eyes on yours…”",CO026CL09
17418,422,“But he has…”,CO026CL09
17419,423,"“He doesn’t have anything; he’s ruined like you. I inquired and I learned the truth. He naturally wants to continue having the same bohemian life he had until today, and your fortune is a way…”",CO026CL09
17420,424,“Are you sure about that?”,CO026CL09
17421,425,“Absolutely sure!”,CO026CL09
17422,426,"Vasconcellos was terrified. In the midst of all his suspicions, he still had the hope of seeing his honor saved, and having that business done would bring him an excellent situation.",CO026CL09
17423,427,But Lourenço’s revelation killed him.,CO026CL09
17424,428,"“If you want proof, call him and tell him you’re poor, and that’s why you refuse him your daughter; keep your eyes on him, and see the effect that your words will produce.”",CO026CL09
17425,429,It wasn’t necessary to send for the suitor. He showed up at Vasconcellos’s house an hour later.,CO026CL09

17428,432,"Soon after the first greetings, Vasconcellos said:",CO026CL09
17429,433,“I was going to send for you.”,CO026CL09
17430,434,“Ah! For what?” Gomes asked.,CO026CL09
17431,435,“To talk about the… marriage.”,CO026CL09
17432,436,“Ah! Is there any obstacle?”,CO026CL09
17433,437,“Let’s talk.”,CO026CL09
17434,438,Gomes became more serious. He glimpsed a great difficulty.,CO026CL09
17435,439,Vasconcellos took the floor.,CO026CL09
17436,440,"“There are circumstances,” he said, “which should be well defined, in order they can be well understood…”",CO026CL09

17440,444,“Is your love above all circumstances?”,CO026CL09
17441,445,"“Yes, except those which agree with her happiness.”",CO026CL09
17442,446,"“We must be frank; apart from being the friend you have always been, now you’re almost my son… Discretion among us would be indiscreet…”",CO026CL09
17443,447,“No doubt!” Gomes replied.,CO026CL09
17444,448,"“I came to know that my businesses aren’t doing well; my expenses profoundly altered the economy of my life, so I’m not lying to you when I tell you that I’m poor.”",CO026CL09
17445,449,Gomes suppressed a grimace.,CO026CL09
17446,450,"“Adelaide,” Vasconcellos continued, “has no fortune, she’ll not even have a dowry; she’s just a woman I’m giving to you. What I assure you is that she’s an angel, and she will be an excellent wife.”",CO026CL09
17447,451,"Vasconcellos was silent, and his gaze, locked on the young man, seemed to want to pluck his soul’s impressions from his facial features.",CO026CL09

17449,453,"At last, the suitor took the floor:",CO026CL09
17450,454,"“I appreciate your sincerity,” he said, “and I’ll use the same.”",CO026CL09
17451,455,“I don’t ask for anything else…”,CO026CL09
17452,456,"“It was certainly not money that inspired this love in me; I believe you’ll do me the justice to believe I’m above such considerations. Apart from that, the day I asked you for my heart’s dear one, I believed I was rich.”",CO026CL09
17453,457,“Did you?”,CO026CL09
17454,458,“Listen. Only yesterday my attorney informed me of the state of my business.”,CO026CL09
17455,459,“Is it bad?”,CO026CL09
17456,460,"“If that was all! But imagine that for six months I’ve been living with the unprecedented efforts made by my prosecutor to find out some money, as he didn’t have the heart to tell me the truth. I came to know everything yesterday!”",CO026CL09
17457,461,“Ah!”,CO026CL09

17464,468,"“Listen. I accept Adelaide on one condition—that she waits a while so that I can start my life. I intend to go to the government and ask for a position, if I still remember what I learned in school… I’ll come get her as soon as I have begun my life. Do you accept?”",CO026CL09
17465,469,"“If she consents,” Vasconcellos said, embracing that lifeline, “it’s decided.”",CO026CL09
17466,470,Gomes continued:,CO026CL09
17467,471,"“Well, you shall speak about it tomorrow, and then send me an answer. Ah! If I still had my fortune, I would now prove my esteem to you!”",CO026CL09

17474,478,"“What I think is singular is that he told me he was poor in advance, when I myself was also poor. But he’ll tarry in vain; two halves don’t make a whole.",CO026CL09
17475,479,Vasconcellos went downstairs.,CO026CL09
17476,480,"His intention was to communicate to Augusta the result of the conversation with the suitor. One thing, however, embarrassed him: it was Augusta’s insistence on not consenting with Adelaide’s marriage without giving any plausible reasons for the refusal.",CO026CL09
17477,481,"He was thinking about it, when, as he crossed the waiting room, he heard voices in the living room.",CO026CL09
17478,482,It was Augusta talking to Carlota.,CO026CL09
17479,483,He was entering the room when these words reached his ears:,CO026CL09
17480,484,“But Adelaide is just a child.”,CO026CL09
17481,485,It was Augusta’s voice.,CO026CL09
17482,486,"“A child,” Carlota said.",CO026CL09
17483,487,“Yes; she isn’t old enough to marry yet.”,CO026CL09
17484,488,"“But if I were you I wouldn’t be opposed to the marriage, even if it were in a few months, because Gomes doesn’t seem to be a bad young man…”",CO026CL09
17485,489,"“He’s not; but anyway, I don’t want Adelaide to get married.”",CO026CL09
17486,490,Vasconcellos put his ear to the keyhole and feared missing a word of the dialogue.,CO026CL09
17487,491,"“What I don’t understand,” Carlota said, “is your insistence. Sooner or later Adelaide is going to get married.”",CO026CL09
17488,492,"“Ah! As late as possible,” Augusta said.",CO026CL09
17489,493,There was silence.,CO026CL09
17490,494,Vasconcellos was impatient.,CO026CL09
17491,495,"“Ah!” Augusta continued, “if you know the terror that gives me the idea of Adelaide’s marriage…”",CO026CL09
17492,496,"“Why, my God?”",CO026CL09
17493,497,"“Why, Carlota? You think of all but one thing. I’m afraid because her children will be my grandchildren! The idea of being a grandmother is horrible, Carlota.”",CO026CL09
17494,498,"Vasconcellos breathed, and opened the door.",CO026CL09
17495,499,“Ah!” Augusta said.,CO026CL09
17496,500,"Vasconcellos greeted Carlota, and just as she left, he turned to his wife and said:",CO026CL09
17497,501,“I’ve heard your conversation with that woman…”,CO026CL09
17498,502,“It wasn’t a secret; but… what did you hear?”,CO026CL09
17499,503,Vasconcellos replied smiling:,CO026CL09
17500,504,"“I heard the cause of your terrors. I never thought that your love for your own beauty could lead you to such egotism. The marriage with Gomes won’t happen. But if Adelaide loves someone, I don’t know how we’ll refuse our consent.”",CO026CL09
17501,505,"“Until then… let’s wait,” Augusta answered.",CO026CL09
17502,506,The conversation stopped there because the distance between the two consorts was too great; one had his head on the noisy pleasures of youth while the other meditated exclusively about herself.,CO026CL09
17503,507,"On the next day, Gomes received a letter from Vasconcellos which was conceived in these terms:",CO026CL09
17504,508,Dear Gomes.,CO026CL09
17505,509,"An unexpected circumstance occurs; the problem is that Adelaide doesn’t want to get married. I wasted my logic, but I couldn’t convince her.",CO026CL09
17506,510,"Yours, Vasconcellos.",CO026CL09
17507,511,"Gomes folded the letter, lighted a cigar and began to smoke as he made the following reflection:",CO026CL09

17509,513,"If anyone knows, let him know in time.",CO026CL09
17510,514,"After what we’ve just told you, Vasconcellos and Gomes sometimes meet on the street or at Alcazar; they talk, they smoke, they hug each other, exactly like two friends, who they have never been, or like the two rascals they are.",CO026CL09

17513,3,IT’S ELEVEN O’CLOCK in the morning.,CO026CL12
17514,4,"Dona Augusta Vasconcelos is reclining on a sofa with a book in her hand. Adelaide, her daughter, is tinkering at the piano.",CO026CL12
17515,5,“Is Papa up yet?” Adelaide asked her mother.,CO026CL12
17516,6,"“No,” Dona Augusta said, without glancing up from her book.",CO026CL12
17517,7,Adelaide left the piano and went over to her mother.,CO026CL12
17518,8,"“But it’s so late, Mama,” she said. “It’s eleven o’clock. Papa does sleep a lot.”",CO026CL12
17519,9,"Augusta put the book down on her lap and, looking at Adelaide, said:",CO026CL12
17520,10,“That’s because he came home very late.”,CO026CL12
17521,11,“I’ve noticed that now Papa’s never here to kiss me good night when I go to bed. He’s always out somewhere.”,CO026CL12
17522,12,Augusta smiled.,CO026CL12
17523,13,"“You’re still such a country bumpkin,” she said. “You go to bed at the same time as the chickens. Things are different here. Your father has things to do at night.”",CO026CL12
17524,14,"“Is it to do with politics, Mama?” asked Adelaide.",CO026CL12
17525,15,"“I don’t know,” said Augusta.",CO026CL12
17526,16,"I began by saying that Adelaide was Augusta’s daughter, and this information, so necessary to the story, was no less necessary in reality, because, at first sight, no one would ever have thought they were mother and daughter; Vasconcelos’s wife was so young that mother and daughter looked more like sisters.",CO026CL12
17527,17,"Augusta was thirty and Adelaide fifteen, but, comparatively speaking, the mother looked even younger than the daughter. She still had all the freshness of a fifteen-year-old, as well as something that Adelaide lacked: an awareness of her own beauty and youth, an awareness that would have been praiseworthy were it not combined with a vanity that was as immense as it was deep.",CO026CL12
17528,18,"She was of only average height, but nevertheless cut an imposing figure. Her skin was, at once, very pale and very rosy. She had brown hair and green eyes. Her long, shapely hands seemed made for loving caresses. Augusta, however, put her hands to better use, covering them in soft kid gloves.",CO026CL12
17529,19,"All of Augusta’s graces were there in Adelaide, but in embryonic form. You could tell that, by the time Adelaide was twenty, she would rival Augusta; meanwhile, she still retained certain childish qualities that somewhat masked those natural gifts.",CO026CL12
17530,20,"And yet a man could easily have fallen in love with her, especially if he was a poet with a liking for fifteen-year-old virgins, perhaps because she was rather pale, and poets down the ages have always had a weakness for pale women.",CO026CL12
17531,21,"Augusta dressed with supreme elegance, and while she did spend a lot of money on clothes, she made the most of those enormous expenditures, if one could describe it as “making the most” of them.",CO026CL12
17532,22,"To be fair, though, Augusta never haggled, she always paid the asking price for everything. She was proud of this, and felt that to behave otherwise was ridiculous and low-class.",CO026CL12
17533,23,"In this, Augusta both shared the sentiments and served the interests of certain traders, who agreed that it would be dishonorable to beat them down on the price of their merchandise.",CO026CL12
17534,24,"Whenever they spoke of this, Augusta’s draper would tell her:",CO026CL12
17535,25,“Asking one price and then selling the product for a lower price is tantamount to confessing that you intended to swindle your customer.”,CO026CL12
17536,26,The draper preferred to do so without confessing to anything.,CO026CL12
17537,27,"And again to be fair to Augusta, we must acknowledge that she spared no expense in ensuring that Adelaide was always dressed as elegantly as she herself was.",CO026CL12
17538,28,And this was no small task.,CO026CL12
17539,29,"From the age of five, Adelaide had been brought up in the country by some of Augusta’s relatives, who were more interested in growing coffee than in spending money on clothes, and Adelaide grew up with those habits and those ideas. This is why arriving in Rio to rejoin her family proved to be a real transformation.",CO026CL12
17540,30,"She passed from one civilization to another; she lived through several years in the space of one hour. Fortunately for her, she had an excellent teacher in her mother. Adelaide changed, and on the day this story begins, she was already quite different, although still a long way behind her mother.",CO026CL12
17541,31,"As Augusta was answering her daughter’s curious question about what Vasconcelos actually did at night, a carriage drew up at the front door.",CO026CL12
17542,32,Adelaide ran to the window.,CO026CL12
17543,33,"“It’s Dona Carlota, Mama,” she said.",CO026CL12
17544,34,"A few minutes later, Dona Carlota entered the room. To introduce readers to this new character, I need say only that she was like a volume two of Augusta: beautiful, like her; elegant, like her; vain, like her, which is to say that they were the very best of enemies.",CO026CL12
17545,35,"Carlota had come to ask Augusta to sing at a concert she was planning to give at home, a concert dreamed up purely as an opportunity to show off her magnificent new dress.",CO026CL12
17546,36,Augusta gladly accepted.,CO026CL12
17547,37,“How’s your husband?” she asked Carlota.,CO026CL12
17548,38,“He’s gone into town. And yours?”,CO026CL12
17549,39,“He’s sleeping.”,CO026CL12
17550,40,“The sleep of the just?” asked Carlota with a mischievous smile.,CO026CL12
17551,41,"“Apparently,” said Augusta.",CO026CL12
17552,42,"At this point, Adelaide, who, at Carlota’s request, had gone over to the piano to play a nocturne, rejoined them.",CO026CL12
17553,43,Augusta’s friend said to her:,CO026CL12
17554,44,“I bet you’ve already got a sweetheart in your sights.”,CO026CL12
17555,45,"Greatly embarrassed, Adelaide blushed deeply and said:",CO026CL12
17556,46,“Don’t say such things.”,CO026CL12
17557,47,"“I’m sure you do; either that or you’re getting to the age when you certainly will have a sweetheart, and I’m telling you now that he’ll be very handsome.”",CO026CL12
17558,48,"“It’s still too early for that,” said Augusta.",CO026CL12
17559,49,“Early!”,CO026CL12
17560,50,"“Yes, she’s only a child. She’ll get married when she’s ready, but that won’t be for a while yet.”",CO026CL12
17561,51,"“I see,” said Carlota, laughing, “you want to prepare her. And I entirely approve, but in that case, don’t take her dolls away from her.”",CO026CL12
17562,52,"“Oh, she’s given up dolls already.”",CO026CL12
17563,53,“Then it will be very hard to fend off any sweethearts. One thing replaces the other.”,CO026CL12
17564,54,"Augusta smiled, and Carlota got up to leave.",CO026CL12
17565,55,“Are you going already?” said Augusta.,CO026CL12
17566,56,"“Yes, I must. Bye-bye.”",CO026CL12
17567,57,“’Bye!”,CO026CL12
17568,58,"They exchanged kisses, and Carlota left.",CO026CL12
17569,59,"Immediately afterward, two delivery boys arrived: one bearing some dresses and the other a novel, all of which had been ordered the day before. The dresses had cost a fortune, and the book was Ernest-Aimé Feydeau’s novel Fanny, a satire on society manners.",CO026CL12
17570,60,II,CO026CL12
17571,61,"At about one in the afternoon that same day, Vasconcelos rose from his bed.",CO026CL12
17572,62,"He was about forty, good-looking, and endowed with a magnificent pair of graying side-whiskers, which gave him the air of a diplomat, something that he was a million miles from being. He had a smiling, expansive face, and positively oozed robust health.",CO026CL12
17573,63,"He possessed a decent fortune and did not work, or, rather, he worked very hard at squandering said fortune, with his wife as enthusiastic collaborator.",CO026CL12
17574,64,"Adelaide had been quite right about her father; he went to bed late, always woke up after midday, and left again in the evening, only to return the following morning in the early hours, which is to say that he made regular brief visits to the family home.",CO026CL12
17575,65,"Only one person had the right to demand that Vasconcelos become a more assiduous visitor, and that was Augusta; but she said nothing. They got on well enough, though, because the husband, as a reward for his wife’s tolerant behavior, denied her nothing and every whim of hers was quickly granted.",CO026CL12
17576,66,"If Vasconcelos could not accompany her to every outing and every ball, a brother of his stood in for him; Lourenço was a commander of two different orders, an opposition politician, an excellent player of ombre, and, in his few moments of leisure, a most amiable fellow.",CO026CL12
17577,67,"He was what might be described as “an awkward so-and-so,” at least as regards his brother, for while he obeyed his sister-in-law’s every order, he would address the occasional admonitory sermon to his brother. Good seed that fell on stony ground.",CO026CL12
17578,68,"Anyway, Vasconcelos had eventually woken up, and he woke in a good mood. His daughter was very pleased to see him; he spoke to his wife most affably, and she responded in kind.",CO026CL12
17579,69,"“Why do you always wake up so late?” asked Adelaide, stroking his side-whiskers.",CO026CL12
17580,70,“Because I go to bed late.”,CO026CL12
17581,71,“But why do you go to bed late?”,CO026CL12
17582,72,"“What a lot of questions!” said Vasconcelos, smiling.",CO026CL12
17583,73,Then he went on:,CO026CL12
17584,74,"“I go to bed late because my political duties require it. You don’t know what politics is: it’s something very ugly, but very necessary.”",CO026CL12
17585,75,“I do know what politics is!” said Adelaide.,CO026CL12
17586,76,"“All right, then, tell me.”",CO026CL12
17587,77,"“In the country, whenever they were beating up the magistrate, they always used to say that the motive was political, which I thought was really odd, because politically speaking, not beating him up would have made much more sense . . .”",CO026CL12
17588,78,"Vasconcelos laughed out loud at his daughter’s remark, and was just going off to have his breakfast when in came his brother, who could not resist saying:",CO026CL12
17589,79,“A fine time to be having breakfast!”,CO026CL12
17590,80,"“Don’t you start. I have my breakfast whenever I feel like it. Don’t try and pin me down to certain hours and certain meanings. Call it breakfast or lunch, I don’t mind, but whatever it is, I’m going to eat it.”",CO026CL12
17591,81,Lourenço responded by pulling a face.,CO026CL12
17592,82,"When breakfast was over, Senhor Batista arrived. Vasconcelos received him in his private study.",CO026CL12
17593,83,"Batista was twenty-five and the typical man-about-town; excellent company at a supper attended by rather dubious guests, but absolutely useless in respectable company. He was witty and quite intelligent, but he had to be in the right situation for these qualities to be revealed. Otherwise, he was handsome, sported a fine mustache, wore expensive shoes, and dressed impeccably; he also smoked like a trooper, but smoked only the finest cigars.",CO026CL12
17594,84,"“Only just woken up, have you?” Batista asked as he went into Vasconcelos’s study.",CO026CL12
17595,85,"“Yes, about three-quarters of an hour ago. I’ve just finished breakfast. Have a cigar.”",CO026CL12
17596,86,"Batista took one and sat down in a chair, while Vasconcelos struck a match.",CO026CL12
17597,87,“Have you seen Gomes?” asked Vasconcelos.,CO026CL12
17598,88,"“Yes, I saw him yesterday. The big news is that he’s given up society life.”",CO026CL12
17599,89,“Really?”,CO026CL12
17600,90,"“When I asked him why he hadn’t been seen for over a month, he told me he was undergoing a transformation, and that the Gomes he was will live on only as a memory. Incredible though it may seem, he appeared to mean it.”",CO026CL12
17601,91,“I don’t believe him. He’s having a joke at our expense. Any other news?”,CO026CL12
17602,92,"“None, not unless you’ve heard any.”",CO026CL12
17603,93,“Not a peep.”,CO026CL12
17604,94,“Come on! Didn’t you go to the Jardim yesterday?”,CO026CL12
17605,95,"“Yes, there was a supper on there . . .”",CO026CL12
17606,96,"“A family do, eh? I was at the Alcazar. What time did that ‘family supper’ end?”",CO026CL12
17607,97,“At four in the morning.”,CO026CL12
17608,98,"Vasconcelos lay down in a hammock, and the conversation continued along the same lines, until a houseboy came to tell Vasconcelos that Senhor Gomes was in the parlor.",CO026CL12
17609,99,"“Ah, the man himself!” said Batista.",CO026CL12
17610,100,"“Tell him to come up,” ordered Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17611,101,"The houseboy went back downstairs, but Gomes only joined them a quarter of an hour later, having spent some time chatting with Augusta and Adelaide.",CO026CL12
17612,102,"“Well, long time no see,” said Vasconcelos when Gomes finally entered the room.",CO026CL12
17613,103,"“You haven’t exactly searched me out,” Gomes retorted.",CO026CL12
17614,104,"“Excuse me, but I’ve been to your house twice, and twice they told me you were out.”",CO026CL12
17615,105,"“That was pure bad luck, because I hardly ever go out now.”",CO026CL12
17616,106,"“So you’ve become a hermit, have you?”",CO026CL12
17617,107,"“I’m a chrysalis at the moment, and will reemerge as a butterfly,” said Gomes, sitting down.",CO026CL12
17618,108,"“Poetry, eh? Watch out, Vasconcelos.”",CO026CL12
17619,109,"This new character, the longed-for, long-lost Gomes, appeared to be about thirty. He, Vasconcelos, and Batista were a trinity of pleasure and dissipation, bound together by an indissoluble friendship.",CO026CL12
17620,110,"When, about a month before, Gomes stopped appearing in the usual circles, everyone noticed, but only Vasconcelos and Batista really felt his absence. However, they did not try too hard to drag Gomes out of his solitude, in case there was some ulterior motive on his part.",CO026CL12
17621,111,"Nevertheless, they greeted Gomes like the prodigal son.",CO026CL12
17622,112,“Where have you been hiding? What’s all this business about chrysalises and butterflies? Who do you think you’re fooling?”,CO026CL12
17623,113,"“No, really, my friends. I’m growing wings.”",CO026CL12
17624,114,"“Wings!” said Batista, trying not to laugh.",CO026CL12
17625,115,“Only if they’re the wings of a sparrow-hawk ready to pounce on its prey . . .”,CO026CL12
17626,116,"“No, I’m serious.”",CO026CL12
17627,117,And Gomes seemed absolutely genuine.,CO026CL12
17628,118,Vasconcelos and Batista exchanged a sideways glance.,CO026CL12
17629,119,"“Well, if it’s true, tell us about these wings of yours and where exactly you want to fly,”",CO026CL12
17630,120,"said Vasconcelos, and Batista added:",CO026CL12
17631,121,"“Yes, you owe us an explanation, and if we, your family council, think it a good explanation, we will give our approval. If not, there’ll be no wings for you, and you’ll go back to being what you’ve always been.”",CO026CL12
17632,122,"“I second that,” said Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17633,123,“It’s quite simple. I’m growing angel’s wings so that I can fly up into the heaven of love.”,CO026CL12
17634,124,“Love!” exclaimed his two friends.,CO026CL12
17635,125,"“Yes, love,” said Gomes. “What have I been up until now? A complete wastrel, a total debauchee, squandering both my fortune and my heart. But is that enough to fill a life? I don’t think so.”",CO026CL12
17636,126,"“I agree, it isn’t enough, there needs to be something else, but the difference lies in how . . .”",CO026CL12
17637,127,"“Exactly,” said Vasconcelos, “exactly. It’s only natural that the two of you will think otherwise, but I believe I’m right in saying that without a chaste, pure love, life is a mere desert.”",CO026CL12
17638,128,Batista gave a start.,CO026CL12
17639,129,Vasconcelos fixed his eyes on Gomes.,CO026CL12
17640,130,"“You’re thinking of getting married, aren’t you?” he said.",CO026CL12
17641,131,"“I don’t know about marriage, I only know that I’m in love and hope one day to marry the woman I love.”",CO026CL12
17642,132,“Marry!” cried Batista.,CO026CL12
17643,133,And he let out a loud guffaw.,CO026CL12
17644,134,"Gomes was so serious, though, and insisted so gravely on his plans for his own regeneration, that the two friends ended up listening with equal seriousness.",CO026CL12
17645,135,"Gomes was speaking a strange language, entirely new on the lips of a man who, at any dionysian or aphrodisiac feast, was always the wildest and rowdiest of guests.",CO026CL12
17646,136,"“So, you’re leaving us, then?” said Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17647,137,"“Me? Yes and no. You will find me in certain salons, but never again will we meet in theaters or in houses of ill repute.”",CO026CL12
17648,138,“De profundis . . .” sang Batista.,CO026CL12
17649,139,“May we at least know where and who your Marion is?” asked Vasconcelos.,CO026CL12
17650,140,"“She’s not a Marion, she’s a Virginie. At first I merely felt fond of her, then fondness became love and is now out-and-out passion. I fought it for as long as I could, but lay down my arms in the face of a far more potent force.",CO026CL12
17651,141,"My great fear was that I would not have a soul worthy to be offered to this gentle creature, but I do, a soul as fiery and pure as it was when I was eighteen. Only the chaste eyes of a virgin could have discovered the divine pearl beneath the mud in my soul. I am being reborn a far better man than I was.”",CO026CL12
17652,142,"“The boy’s clearly insane, Vasconcelos. We should pack him off to the lunatic asylum this minute, and just in case he should suffer some new attack of madness, I’ll leave right now.”",CO026CL12
17653,143,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO026CL12
17654,144,“Where are you going?” asked Gomes.,CO026CL12
17655,145,"“I have things to do, but I’ll come and see you shortly. I want to find out if there’s still time to haul you out of the abyss.”",CO026CL12
17656,146,And with that he left.,CO026CL12
17657,147,III,CO026CL12
17658,148,"Once they were alone, Vasconcelos asked:",CO026CL12
17659,149,“So you really are in love?”,CO026CL12
17660,150,"“Yes, I am. I knew you’d find that hard to believe; I myself don’t quite believe it, and yet it’s true. I’m ending up where you began. For better or worse? For better, I think.”",CO026CL12
17661,151,“Do you intend to conceal the person’s name?”,CO026CL12
17662,152,“I’ll conceal it from everyone but you.”,CO026CL12
17663,153,"“You clearly trust me, then . . .”",CO026CL12
17664,154,Gomes smiled.,CO026CL12
17665,155,"“No,” he said, “it’s a necessary condition. You, above all men, should know the name of my heart’s chosen one, for she’s your daughter.”",CO026CL12
17666,156,“Adelaide?” asked Vasconcelos in astonishment.,CO026CL12
17667,157,"“Yes, your daughter.”",CO026CL12
17668,158,This revelation was a real bombshell. Vasconcelos had never suspected such a thing.,CO026CL12
17669,159,“Do you approve?” asked Gomes.,CO026CL12
17670,160,"Vasconcelos was thinking, and, after a few moments of silence, he said:",CO026CL12
17671,161,"“My heart approves of your choice; you’re my friend, you’re in love, and as long as she loves you . . .”",CO026CL12
17672,162,"Gomes was about to speak, but, smiling, Vasconcelos went on:",CO026CL12
17673,163,“But what about society?”,CO026CL12
17674,164,“What society?”,CO026CL12
17675,165,“The society that believes both you and me to be libertines; they’re hardly going to approve.”,CO026CL12
17676,166,"“So that’s a no, is it?” said Gomes sadly.",CO026CL12
17677,167,"“No, it’s not, you fool! It’s an objection you could rebut by declaring that society is a great slanderer and famously indiscreet. My daughter is yours, on one condition.”",CO026CL12
17678,168,“Which is?”,CO026CL12
17679,169,“Reciprocity. Does she love you?”,CO026CL12
17680,170,“I don’t know.”,CO026CL12
17681,171,“So you’re not sure . . .”,CO026CL12
17682,172,"“I really don’t know, I only know that I love her and would give my life for her, but I have no idea if my feelings are requited.”",CO026CL12
17683,173,"“They will be. I’ll test the waters. In two days’ time, I’ll give you my answer. To think you could be my son-in-law . . .”",CO026CL12
17684,174,Gomes’s response was to fall into his friend’s arms. The scene was verging on the comic when three o’clock struck. Gomes remembered that he’d arranged to meet another friend. Vasconcelos remembered that he had to write some letters.,CO026CL12
17685,175,Gomes left without speaking to the two ladies.,CO026CL12
17686,176,"At about four o’clock, Vasconcelos was preparing to go out, when he was told that Senhor José Brito had come to see him.",CO026CL12
17687,177,"When he heard this name, the normally jovial Vasconcelos frowned.",CO026CL12
17688,178,"Shortly afterward, Senhor José Brito entered his study.",CO026CL12
17689,179,"Senhor José Brito was, as far as Vasconcelos was concerned, a specter, an echo from the abyss, the voice of reality—a creditor.",CO026CL12
17690,180,"“I wasn’t expecting to see you today,” said Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17691,181,"“I’m surprised,” answered Senhor José Brito with a kind of piercing calm, “because today is the twenty-first.”",CO026CL12
17692,182,"“I thought it was the nineteenth,” stammered Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17693,183,"“The day before yesterday it was, but today is the twenty-first. Look,” said the creditor, picking up the Jornal do Commercio lying on a chair, “Thursday the twenty-first.”",CO026CL12
17694,184,“Have you come for the money?”,CO026CL12
17695,185,"“Here’s the bill of exchange,” said Senhor José Brito, taking his wallet out of his pocket and a piece of paper out of the wallet.",CO026CL12
17696,186,"“Why didn’t you come earlier?” asked Vasconcelos, trying to put off the evil hour.",CO026CL12
17697,187,"“I came at eight o’clock this morning,” replied the creditor, “and you were asleep; I came at nine, idem; I came at ten, idem; I came at eleven, idem; I came at noon, idem. I could have come at one o’clock, but I had to send a man to prison and I couldn’t get away any earlier. At three, I had my dinner, and here I am at four o’clock.”",CO026CL12
17698,188,Vasconcelos took a puff on his cigar to see if he could come up with some clever way of avoiding making a payment he had not been expecting.,CO026CL12
17699,189,"Nothing occurred to him, but then the creditor himself gave him an opening.",CO026CL12
17700,190,"“Besides,” he said, “the time hardly matters, since I was sure you would pay me.”",CO026CL12
17701,191,"“Ah,” said Vasconcelos, “that explains it. I wasn’t expecting you today, you see, and so I don’t have the money with me.”",CO026CL12
17702,192,"“What’s to be done, then?” asked the creditor innocently.",CO026CL12
17703,193,Vasconcelos felt a glimmer of hope.,CO026CL12
17704,194,“You could wait until tomorrow.”,CO026CL12
17705,195,"“Ah, tomorrow I’m hoping to be present at the confiscation of assets from an individual I took to court for a very large debt, so I’m afraid I can’t . . .”",CO026CL12
17706,196,"“I see, well, in that case, I’ll bring the money to your house.”",CO026CL12
17707,197,"“That would be fine if business worked like that. If we were friends, then obviously I would accept your promise and it would all be settled tomorrow, but I’m your creditor, and my one aim is to protect my own interests. Therefore, I think it would be best if you paid me today.”",CO026CL12
17708,198,Vasconcelos smoothed his hair with one hand.,CO026CL12
17709,199,“But I don’t have the money!” he said.,CO026CL12
17710,200,"“Yes, that must be very awkward for you, but it doesn’t upset me in the least; that is, it ought to upset me a little, because you clearly find yourself in a very precarious situation.”",CO026CL12
17711,201,“Do I?”,CO026CL12
17712,202,"“Indeed. Your properties in Rua da Imperatriz are mortgaged up to the hilt; the house in Rua de São Pedro was sold, and the money from the sale long since spent; your slaves have all left one by one, without you even noticing, and you recently spent a vast amount on setting up house for a certain lady of dubious reputation. You see, I know it all. More than you do yourself.”",CO026CL12
17713,203,Vasconcelos was visibly terrified.,CO026CL12
17714,204,The creditor was telling the truth.,CO026CL12
17715,205,"“But,” said Vasconcelos, “what are we to do?”",CO026CL12
17716,206,"“That’s easy enough, we double the debt, and you give me a deposit right now.”",CO026CL12
17717,207,"“Double the debt, but that’s—”",CO026CL12
17718,208,"“Throwing you a lifeline. I’m really being very reasonable. Come on, say yes. Write me a note for the deposit now and we’ll tear up the bill of exchange.”",CO026CL12
17719,209,"Vasconcelos tried to object, but it was impossible to convince Senhor José Brito.",CO026CL12
17720,210,He signed a note for eighteen contos.,CO026CL12
17721,211,"When his creditor left, Vasconcelos began thinking seriously about his life.",CO026CL12
17722,212,"Up until then, he had spent so wildly and so blindly that he hadn’t noticed the abyss he himself had dug beneath his feet.",CO026CL12
17723,213,It had taken the voice of one of his executioners to alert him to this.,CO026CL12
17724,214,"Vasconcelos pondered, calculated, and went through all his expenses and his obligations, and saw that he had less than a quarter of his fortune left—a mere pittance if he were to continue living as he had until now.",CO026CL12
17725,215,What to do?,CO026CL12
17726,216,Vasconcelos picked up his hat and went out.,CO026CL12
17727,217,It was growing dark.,CO026CL12
17728,218,"After walking for some time, deep in thought, he went into the Alcazar.",CO026CL12
17729,219,It was a way of distracting himself.,CO026CL12
17730,220,There he found the usual people.,CO026CL12
17731,221,Batista came to greet his friend.,CO026CL12
17732,222,“Why the glum face?” he asked.,CO026CL12
17733,223,"And for want of a better answer, Vasconcelos replied: “Oh, it’s nothing. Someone just stepped on a corn.”",CO026CL12
17734,224,"However, a chiropodist standing nearby heard this remark and thereafter did not take his eyes off poor Vasconcelos, who was in a particularly sensitive mood that night. In the end, he found the chiropodist’s insistent gaze so troubling that he left.",CO026CL12
17735,225,"He went to the Hotel de Milão to have supper. However preoccupied he might be, his stomach was still making its usual demands.",CO026CL12
17736,226,"In the middle of eating, he suddenly remembered the one thing he should never have forgotten: Gomes’s proposal of marriage to his daughter.",CO026CL12
17737,227,It was like a ray of sunshine.,CO026CL12
17738,228,"“Gomes is rich,” thought Vasconcelos. “That’s the best way out of all these problems. Gomes can marry Adelaide, and, since he’s my friend, he couldn’t possibly deny me what I need. For my part, I will try to get back what I’ve lost. What a stroke of luck!”",CO026CL12
17739,229,"Vasconcelos continued his meal in the best of moods, then returned to the Alcazar, where a few other lads and some members of the female sex helped him to forget his troubles completely.",CO026CL12
17740,230,He returned peacefully home at his regular time of three o’clock in the morning.,CO026CL12
17741,231,IV,CO026CL12
17742,232,"The following day, Vasconcelos’s first priority was to sound out Adelaide. He wanted to do so, though, when Augusta was not there. Fortunately, she needed to go to Rua da Quitanda to view some new fabrics, and she set off with her brother-in-law, leaving Vasconcelos entirely free.",CO026CL12
17743,233,"As readers will already know, Adelaide loved her father deeply, and would do anything for him. She was, moreover, the soul of kindness. Vasconcelos was counting on those two qualities.",CO026CL12
17744,234,"“Come here, Adelaide,” he said, going into the living room. “How old are you now?”",CO026CL12
17745,235,“Fifteen.”,CO026CL12
17746,236,“Do you know how old your mother is?”,CO026CL12
17747,237,"“She’s twenty-seven, isn’t she?”",CO026CL12
17748,238,"“No, she’s thirty, which means that your mother married when she was just fifteen.”",CO026CL12
17749,239,"Vasconcelos paused to gauge the effect of these words, but in vain. Adelaide had no idea what he was getting at.",CO026CL12
17750,240,Her father went on:,CO026CL12
17751,241,“Have you considered marriage?”,CO026CL12
17752,242,"She blushed deeply and said nothing, but when her father insisted, she answered:",CO026CL12
17753,243,"“Oh, Papa, I don’t want to marry.”",CO026CL12
17754,244,“You don’t want to marry? Whyever not?”,CO026CL12
17755,245,“Because I don’t want to. I’m happy living here.”,CO026CL12
17756,246,“You could marry and still live here.”,CO026CL12
17757,247,"“Yes, but I don’t want to.”",CO026CL12
17758,248,"“Come on, you’re in love with someone, aren’t you? Admit it.”",CO026CL12
17759,249,"“Don’t ask me such things, Papa. I’m not in love with anyone.”",CO026CL12
17760,250,Adelaide sounded so genuine that Vasconcelos could not doubt her sincerity.,CO026CL12
17761,251,"“She’s telling the truth,” he thought. “I need to try another tack.”",CO026CL12
17762,252,Adelaide sat down next to him and said:,CO026CL12
17763,253,"“So can we just not talk about this anymore, Papa?”",CO026CL12
17764,254,"“We must talk, my dear. You’re still a child and can’t yet look to the future. Imagine if I and your mother were to die tomorrow. Who would look after you? Only a husband.”",CO026CL12
17765,255,“But there’s no one I like.”,CO026CL12
17766,256,"“Not at the moment, but if your fiancé were a handsome lad with a good heart, you would come to like him. I’ve already chosen someone who loves you deeply, and you’ll come to love him too.”",CO026CL12
17767,257,Adelaide shuddered.,CO026CL12
17768,258,“I will?” she said. “But who is it?”,CO026CL12
17769,259,“Gomes.”,CO026CL12
17770,260,"“But I don’t love him, Papa.”",CO026CL12
17771,261,"“Not now, I’m sure, but you can’t deny that he’s worthy of being loved. In a couple of months you’ll be madly in love with him.”",CO026CL12
17772,262,"Adelaide said not a word. She bowed her head and started playing with one of her thick, dark plaits. She was breathing hard and staring down at the carpet.",CO026CL12
17773,263,"“So that’s agreed, is it?” asked Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17774,264,"“But, Papa, what if I was unhappy?”",CO026CL12
17775,265,"“That’s impossible, my dear. You will be happy and you’ll adore your husband.”",CO026CL12
17776,266,"“Oh, Papa,” said Adelaide, her eyes brimming with tears, “please don’t make me marry yet.”",CO026CL12
17777,267,"“Adelaide, a daughter’s first duty is to obey her father, and I’m your father. I want you to marry Gomes and you will marry him.”",CO026CL12
17778,268,"To have their full effect, these words needed to be followed by a quick exit. Vasconcelos knew this and immediately departed, leaving Adelaide in deep despair.",CO026CL12
17779,269,"She didn’t love anyone. No other love object lay behind her refusal, nor did she feel any particular aversion for her would-be suitor.",CO026CL12
17780,270,She merely felt complete indifference.,CO026CL12
17781,271,"In the circumstances, marriage could only be a hateful imposition.",CO026CL12
17782,272,But what could Adelaide do? Who could she turn to?,CO026CL12
17783,273,She had only her tears.,CO026CL12
17784,274,"As for Vasconcelos, he went up to his study and wrote the following lines to his future son-in-law:",CO026CL12
17785,275,"Everything is going well. I give you permission to come and pay court to my daughter, and hope to see you married in a couple of months.",CO026CL12
17786,276,He sealed the letter and sent it off.,CO026CL12
17787,277,"Shortly afterward, Augusta and Lourenço returned.",CO026CL12
17788,278,"While Augusta disappeared up to her boudoir to change her clothes, Lourenço went looking for Adelaide, who was out in the garden.",CO026CL12
17789,279,"Noticing that her eyes were red, he asked her why, but she denied she had been crying.",CO026CL12
17790,280,Lourenço didn’t believe his niece and urged her to tell him what was wrong.,CO026CL12
17791,281,"Adelaide trusted her uncle, almost because he was so direct and gruff. After a few minutes, Adelaide told Lourenço all about the scene with her father.",CO026CL12
17792,282,"“So that’s why you’re crying, little one.”",CO026CL12
17793,283,“Yes. How can I avoid getting married?”,CO026CL12
17794,284,"“Don’t worry, you won’t have to. I promise.”",CO026CL12
17795,285,Adelaide felt a shiver of joy.,CO026CL12
17796,286,"“Do you promise, Uncle, to persuade Papa?”",CO026CL12
17797,287,"“Well, persuade or prevail, one or the other, but you won’t have to get married. Your father is a fool.”",CO026CL12
17798,288,Lourenço went up to see Vasconcelos at precisely the moment when the latter was about to leave.,CO026CL12
17799,289,“Are you going out?” asked Lourenço.,CO026CL12
17800,290,“I am.”,CO026CL12
17801,291,“I need to talk to you.”,CO026CL12
17802,292,"Lourenço sat down, and Vasconcelos, who already had his hat on, stood waiting for him to speak.",CO026CL12
17803,293,"“Sit down,” said Lourenço.",CO026CL12
17804,294,Vasconcelos sat down.,CO026CL12
17805,295,“Sixteen years ago—”,CO026CL12
17806,296,"“You’re going an awfully long way back. If you don’t shave off half a dozen years, I can’t promise to hear you out.”",CO026CL12
17807,297,"“Sixteen years ago,” Lourenço went on, “you got married, but the difference between that first day and today is enormous.”",CO026CL12
17808,298,"“Of course,” said Vasconcelos. “Tempora mutantur, nos et—”",CO026CL12
17809,299,"“At the time,” Lourenço went on, “you said you’d found paradise, a true paradise, and for two or three years you were a model husband. Then you changed completely, and paradise would have become a real hell if your wife were not the cold, indifferent creature she is, thus avoiding some truly terrible domestic scenes.”",CO026CL12
17810,300,"“But what has this got to do with you, Lourenço?”",CO026CL12
17811,301,"“Nothing, and that isn’t what I wanted to talk to you about. What I want to do is to stop you sacrificing your daughter on a whim, handing her over to one of your fellow dissolutes.”",CO026CL12
17812,302,Vasconcelos sprang to his feet:,CO026CL12
17813,303,"“You must be insane,” he said.",CO026CL12
17814,304,"“No, I’m perfectly sane and prudently advising you not to sacrifice your daughter to a libertine.”",CO026CL12
17815,305,"“Gomes isn’t a libertine. True, he’s led the life of many a young man, but he loves Adelaide and is a reformed character. It’s a good marriage, and that’s why I think we must all accept it. That’s what I want, and I’m the one who gives the orders around here.”",CO026CL12
17816,306,"Lourenço was about to say more, but Vasconcelos had left.",CO026CL12
17817,307,“What can I do?” thought Lourenço.,CO026CL12
17818,308,V,CO026CL12
17819,309,"Vasconcelos was not greatly bothered by Lourenço’s opposition to his plans. He could, it’s true, sow the seeds of resistance in his niece’s mind, but Adelaide was easily persuaded and would agree with whoever she happened to be speaking to, and the advice she received one day would easily be overthrown by any contrary advice she was given the following day.",CO026CL12
17820,310,"Still, it would be wise to get Augusta’s support. Vasconcelos decided to do this as soon as possible.",CO026CL12
17821,311,"Meanwhile, he needed to organize his own affairs, and so he found a lawyer, to whom he gave all the necessary documents and information, charging him with providing the necessary guidance and advising him on what measures he could take to oppose any claims made against him because of his debts or his mortgages.",CO026CL12
17822,312,None of this should make you think that Vasconcelos was about to change his ways. He was simply preparing himself to continue life as before.,CO026CL12
17823,313,"Two days after his conversation with his brother, Vasconcelos went in search of Augusta, in order to speak frankly with her about Adelaide’s marriage.",CO026CL12
17824,314,"During that time, the future bridegroom, taking Vasconcelos’s advice, was already paying court to Adelaide. If the marriage was not forced on her, it was just possible that she might end up liking the lad. Besides, Gomes was a handsome, elegant fellow and knew how to impress a woman.",CO026CL12
17825,315,Would Augusta have noticed his unusually assiduous presence in the house? That was the question Vasconcelos was asking himself as he went into his wife’s boudoir.,CO026CL12
17826,316,“Are you going out?” he asked her.,CO026CL12
17827,317,"“No, I’m expecting a visitor.”",CO026CL12
17828,318,"“Oh, who?”",CO026CL12
17829,319,"“Seabra’s wife,” she said.",CO026CL12
17830,320,Vasconcelos sat down and tried to find a way of beginning the special conversation that had brought him there.,CO026CL12
17831,321,“You’re looking very pretty today!”,CO026CL12
17832,322,"“Really?” she said, smiling. “Well, I’m no different today than on any other day, and it’s odd that you should pick today to say so.”",CO026CL12
17833,323,"“No, I mean it, you’re even prettier than usual, so much so, that I could almost feel jealous.”",CO026CL12
17834,324,"“Come, now!” said Augusta with an ironic smile.",CO026CL12
17835,325,"Vasconcelos scratched his head, took out his watch, wound it up, tugged at his beard, picked up a newspaper, read a couple of advertisements, then threw the paper down on the floor; finally, after a rather long silence, he thought it best to make a frontal assault on the citadel.",CO026CL12
17836,326,"“I’ve been thinking about Adelaide,” he said.",CO026CL12
17837,327,“Why’s that?”,CO026CL12
17838,328,“She’s a young woman—”,CO026CL12
17839,329,“A young woman!” exclaimed Augusta. “She’s still a child.”,CO026CL12
17840,330,“She’s older than you were when you got married.”,CO026CL12
17841,331,Augusta frowned slightly.,CO026CL12
17842,332,“What are you getting at?” she asked.,CO026CL12
17843,333,"“What I’m getting at is that I want to make her happy by seeing her happily married. Some days ago, a very worthy young man asked me for her hand and I said yes. When I tell you the young man’s name, I’m sure you’ll approve. It’s Gomes. They should marry, don’t you think?”",CO026CL12
17844,334,“Certainly not!” retorted Augusta.,CO026CL12
17845,335,“Why not?”,CO026CL12
17846,336,“Adelaide’s just a child. She’s not old enough or sensible enough yet. She’ll marry when the time is right.”,CO026CL12
17847,337,“When the time is right? Are you sure the young man will wait that long?”,CO026CL12
17848,338,"“Patience,” said Augusta.",CO026CL12
17849,339,“Do you have something against Gomes?”,CO026CL12
17850,340,"“No. He’s a distinguished enough young fellow, but he’s not right for Adelaide.”",CO026CL12
17851,341,"Vasconcelos hesitated before continuing; it seemed to him there was no point in going on. However, the thought of Gomes’s fortune gave him courage, and he asked:",CO026CL12
17852,342,“Why isn’t he?”,CO026CL12
17853,343,"“Are you so very sure he’s right for Adelaide?” said Augusta, avoiding her husband’s question.",CO026CL12
17854,344,"“Yes, I am.”",CO026CL12
17855,345,"“Well, whether he’s right or not, she shouldn’t get married now.”",CO026CL12
17856,346,“What if she were in love?”,CO026CL12
17857,347,“What does that matter? She’ll wait!”,CO026CL12
17858,348,"“I have to tell you, Augusta, that we can’t let this marriage pass us by. It’s an absolute necessity.”",CO026CL12
17859,349,“An absolute necessity? I don’t understand.”,CO026CL12
17860,350,“Let me explain. Gomes has a large fortune.”,CO026CL12
17861,351,“So do we.”,CO026CL12
17862,352,"“That’s where you’re wrong,” said Vasconcelos, interrupting her.",CO026CL12
17863,353,“How so?”,CO026CL12
17864,354,Vasconcelos went on:,CO026CL12
17865,355,"“You’d have to find out sooner or later, and I think this is the moment to tell you the truth, and the truth is that we’re poor, ruined.”",CO026CL12
17866,356,"Augusta heard these words, her eyes wide with horror.",CO026CL12
17867,357,“It’s not possible!”,CO026CL12
17868,358,"“Unfortunately, it is.”",CO026CL12
17869,359,A silence fell.,CO026CL12
17870,360,"“There, I’ve got her,” thought Vasconcelos.",CO026CL12
17871,361,Augusta broke the silence.,CO026CL12
17872,362,"“But if our fortune has gone, I’d have thought you would have something better to do than sit around talking about it; you need to rebuild that fortune.”",CO026CL12
17873,363,"Vasconcelos gave her a look of utter astonishment, and as if this look were a question, Augusta quickly added:",CO026CL12
17874,364,“Don’t look so surprised. I think it’s your duty to rebuild our fortune.”,CO026CL12
17875,365,"“That isn’t what surprises me, what I find surprising is that you should put it like that. Anyone would think I was to blame.”",CO026CL12
17876,366,"“Oh,” said Augusta, “I suppose you’re going to say that I am.”",CO026CL12
17877,367,"“If blame there is, then we’re both to blame.”",CO026CL12
17878,368,"“What, me too?”",CO026CL12
17879,369,"“Yes, you too. Your wildly extravagant spending sprees have been a major contributor to our downfall; and since I’ve denied you nothing and still deny you nothing, I take full responsibility. And if that’s what you’re throwing in my face, then I agree.”",CO026CL12
17880,370,Augusta gave an angry shrug and shot Vasconcelos a look of such scorn that it would have been valid grounds for divorce.,CO026CL12
17881,371,Vasconcelos saw the shrug and the look.,CO026CL12
17882,372,"“A love of luxury and excess,” he said, “will always have the same consequences, which are terrible, but perfectly understandable. The only way of avoiding them is to live more moderately, but that never even occurred to you. After six months of married life, you plunged into the whirlwind of fashion, and your little stream of expenditures became a vast river of profligacy.",CO026CL12
17883,373,Do you know what my brother said to me once? He said that the reason you sent Adelaide off to the country was so that you would be free to live with no obligations of any kind.”,CO026CL12
17884,374,Augusta had stood up and taken a few steps across the room; she was pale and trembling.,CO026CL12
17885,375,"Vasconcelos was continuing this litany of recriminations, when his wife interrupted him, saying:",CO026CL12
17886,376,“And why did you not put a stop to my extravagance?”,CO026CL12
17887,377,“For the sake of domestic harmony.”,CO026CL12
17888,378,"“Lies!” she cried. “You wanted to live a free and independent life. Seeing me embarking on that life of excess, you thought you could buy my tolerance of your behavior by tolerating mine. That was the only reason. The way you live may be different from mine, but it’s far worse. I may have squandered money at home, but you did the same out in the street.",CO026CL12
17889,379,"There’s no point denying it, because I know everything; I know all the names of the succession of rivals you’ve given me, and I never said a word, and I’m not censuring you now, that would be pointless and too late.”",CO026CL12
17890,380,"The situation had changed. Vasconcelos had begun as judge and ended up as codefendant. It was impossible to deny, and arguing was risky and futile. He preferred to appear reasonable, even cajoling.",CO026CL12
17891,381,"“Given the facts (and I accept that you’re right), we are clearly both to blame, and I see no reason to lay all the blame on me. I should rebuild our fortune, I agree. And one way of doing that is to marry Adelaide off to Gomes.”",CO026CL12
17892,382,"“No,” said Augusta.",CO026CL12
17893,383,"“Fine, then, we’ll be poor and even worse off than we are now; we’ll sell everything . . .”",CO026CL12
17894,384,"“Forgive me,” said Augusta, “but I don’t understand why you, a strong young man, who clearly played the larger role in bringing about this disaster, cannot throw yourself into rebuilding our squandered fortune.”",CO026CL12
17895,385,"“It would take a very long time, and meanwhile life goes on and we keep spending. As I’ve said, the best way out of this is to marry Adelaide off to Gomes.”",CO026CL12
17896,386,"“No, I don’t want that,” said Augusta, “I won’t consent to such a marriage.”",CO026CL12
17897,387,"Vasconcelos was about to respond, but Augusta, having uttered these words, had flounced out of the room.",CO026CL12
17898,388,Vasconcelos followed a few minutes later.,CO026CL12
17899,389,VI,CO026CL12
17900,390,"Lourenço knew nothing about this scene between his brother and sister-in-law, and, given Vasconcelos’s stubbornness, he had decided to say nothing more; however, since he was very fond of his niece and did not want to see her handed over to a man of whose habits he disapproved, he decided to wait until the situation took a more decisive turn and only then play a more active role.",CO026CL12
17901,391,"In order not to waste time, though, and possibly to gain the use of some potentially powerful weapon, Lourenço began an investigation intended to gather detailed information on Gomes.",CO026CL12
17902,392,"Gomes, for his part, believed the marriage to be a certainty, and did not waste a moment in his conquest of Adelaide.",CO026CL12
17903,393,"He could not fail to notice, however, that for no reason he could ascertain, her mother Augusta was becoming increasingly cold and indifferent, and it occurred to him that she was possibly the source of some opposition.",CO026CL12
17904,394,"As for Vasconcelos, discouraged by the discussion in his wife’s boudoir, he was hoping for better days and depending, above all, on the sheer force of necessity.",CO026CL12
17905,395,"One day, however, exactly forty-eight hours after his argument with Augusta, he asked himself this question:",CO026CL12
17906,396,“Why is Augusta refusing to give Adelaide to Gomes in marriage?”,CO026CL12
17907,397,"One question led to another, one deduction led to another, and a painful suspicion took root in Vasconcelos’s mind.",CO026CL12
17908,398,“Does she perhaps love him?” he wondered.,CO026CL12
17909,399,"Then, as if one abyss attracted another abyss, and one suspicion called to another suspicion, Vasconcelos thought:",CO026CL12
17910,400,“Were they once lovers?”,CO026CL12
17911,401,"For the first time, Vasconcelos felt the serpent of jealousy biting his heart.",CO026CL12
17912,402,"I say “jealousy” for want of a better word, because I don’t know if what he was feeling was jealousy or merely wounded pride.",CO026CL12
17913,403,Could Vasconcelos’s suspicions have any basis in fact?,CO026CL12
17914,404,"To be honest, no. However vain Augusta might be, she remained faithful to her unfaithful husband, and for two reasons: her conscience and her temperament. Even if she hadn’t been convinced of her duty as a wife, she would never break her wedding vows.",CO026CL12
17915,405,"She was not made for passions, apart from the ridiculous passions aroused by vanity. She loved her own beauty above all things, and her best friend was whoever would tell her she was the most beautiful of women; and yet, while she would give away her friendship, she would never give away her heart, and this is what saved her.",CO026CL12
17916,406,"And there you have the truth: But who would tell Vasconcelos? Once he began to suspect that his honor was at risk, Vasconcelos started to review his whole life. Gomes had been a visitor to his house for six years and was free to come and go as he liked.",CO026CL12
17917,407,"An act of betrayal would be easy enough. Vasconcelos recalled words, gestures, glances, none of which had been of any significance before, but which, now, began to look suspicious.",CO026CL12
17918,408,"For two days, Vasconcelos was consumed by these thoughts. He did not leave the house, and whenever Gomes arrived, he would observe his wife with unusual interest; even the coldness with which she received Gomes was, in her husband’s eyes, proof of the crime.",CO026CL12
17919,409,"Then, on the morning of the third day (Vasconcelos now rose early), his brother came into his study, looking his usual disapproving self.",CO026CL12
17920,410,Lourenço’s presence prompted Vasconcelos to reveal everything to him.,CO026CL12
17921,411,"Lourenço was a man of good sense and, when necessary, could be supportive too.",CO026CL12
17922,412,"He listened to Vasconcelos, and when the latter had finished, he broke his silence with these words:",CO026CL12
17923,413,"“This is pure nonsense. If your wife is against the marriage, then it’s for some other reason.”",CO026CL12
17924,414,“But it’s the marriage to Gomes she’s objecting to.”,CO026CL12
17925,415,"“Yes, because you presented Gomes to her as the suitor, but she might well have reacted in the same way if you had suggested someone else. There must be another reason; perhaps Adelaide has spoken to her and asked her to oppose the marriage, because your daughter doesn’t love Gomes and can’t marry him.”",CO026CL12
17926,416,“But she will.”,CO026CL12
17927,417,"“That’s not the only reason she can’t marry him, though . . .”",CO026CL12
17928,418,“Go on.”,CO026CL12
17929,419,“There’s also the fact that the marriage is pure speculation on Gomes’s part.”,CO026CL12
17930,420,“Speculation?” asked Vasconcelos.,CO026CL12
17931,421,"“Just as it is for you,” said Lourenço. “You’re giving him your daughter because you have your eyes on his fortune; and he will take her because he has his eyes on yours . . .”",CO026CL12
17932,422,“But he—”,CO026CL12
17933,423,"“He has nothing. He’s ruined like you. I did a little investigating and learned the truth. Naturally, he wants to continue the same dissolute life he has led up until now, and your fortune is a way to do that.”",CO026CL12
17934,424,“Are you sure of this?”,CO026CL12
17935,425,“Absolutely.”,CO026CL12
17936,426,"Vasconcelos was terrified. In the midst of all his suspicions, he had still clung to the hope that his honor would be saved and that the marriage would set him up financially.",CO026CL12
17937,427,Lourenço’s revelation put paid to that hope.,CO026CL12
17938,428,"“If you want proof, send for him and tell him you’re penniless and, for that reason, cannot allow him to marry your daughter. Observe him closely and see what effect your words have on him.”",CO026CL12
17939,429,"There was no need to summon the suitor. An hour later, he called at the house.",CO026CL12
17940,430,Vasconcelos told him to come straight up to his study.,CO026CL12

17942,432,"After an initial exchange of courtesies, Vasconcelos said:",CO026CL12

17944,434,“Why’s that?” asked Gomes.,CO026CL12
17945,435,“So that we could talk about . . . about the marriage.”,CO026CL12
17946,436,"“Ah, is there a problem?”",CO026CL12
17947,437,“I’ll explain.”,CO026CL12
17948,438,"Gomes grew more serious, foreseeing some grave difficulty.",CO026CL12
17949,439,Vasconcelos spoke first.,CO026CL12
17950,440,"“There are certain circumstances,” he said, “that need to be set out very clearly, so that there can be no room for misunderstanding . . .”",CO026CL12
17951,441,“I agree entirely.”,CO026CL12
17952,442,“Do you love my daughter?”,CO026CL12
17953,443,"“How often do I have to tell you? Yes, I do.”",CO026CL12
17954,444,“And you will love her whatever the circumstances?”,CO026CL12
17955,445,"“Yes, unless those circumstances might affect her happiness.”",CO026CL12
17956,446,"“Let’s be frank, then, since, as well as the friend you have always been, you are now almost my son. For us to be discreet would be decidedly indiscreet.”",CO026CL12
17957,447,"“Indeed,” said Gomes.",CO026CL12
17958,448,"“I’ve just found out that my financial affairs are in a parlous state. I have overspent and am basically ruined, and it would be no exaggeration to say that I am now poor.”",CO026CL12
17959,449,Gomes did his best not to look shocked.,CO026CL12
17960,450,"“Adelaide,” Vasconcelos went on, “has no fortune, not even a dowry. All I am giving you is a young woman, although I can promise you that she’s a real angel and will make an excellent wife.”",CO026CL12
17961,451,"Vasconcelos fell silent, his eyes fixed on Gomes, as if, by scrutinizing his face he might discover what was going on in his heart.",CO026CL12
17962,452,"Gomes should have responded at once, but, for a few minutes, a deep silence reigned.",CO026CL12
17963,453,"Finally, he spoke.",CO026CL12

17965,455,“I would expect no less.”,CO026CL12
17966,456,"“It was certainly not money that prompted my love for your daughter; I trust you will do me the justice of believing that I am above such base considerations. Besides, on the day when I asked you for the hand of my beloved, I believed myself to be rich.”",CO026CL12
17967,457,“Believed?”,CO026CL12
17968,458,"“Yes, only yesterday, my lawyer told me the true state of my financial affairs.”",CO026CL12
17969,459,"“Not good, eh?”",CO026CL12
17970,460,"“Oh, if only it were as simple as that. But it seems that for the last six months I have been existing thanks entirely to my lawyer’s extraordinary efforts to scrape together some money, because he couldn’t bring himself to tell me the truth. And I only found out yesterday!”",CO026CL12
17971,461,“I see.”,CO026CL12
17972,462,"“Imagine the despair of a man who believes himself to be wealthy and, one day, discovers he has nothing!”",CO026CL12
17973,463,“I don’t need to imagine it!”,CO026CL12
17974,464,"“I came here today feeling happy, because any happiness I still have resides in this house; but the truth is that I’m poised on the edge of an abyss. Fate has chosen to punish us both at the same moment.”",CO026CL12
17975,465,"After this explanation, to which Vasconcelos listened unblinking, Gomes tackled the thorniest part of the matter.",CO026CL12
17976,466,"“As I say, I appreciate your frankness and I accept your daughter even without a fortune. I have no fortune, either, but I am still strong enough to work.”",CO026CL12
17977,467,"“You accept her, then?”",CO026CL12
17978,468,"“Listen, I accept Dona Adelaide on one condition: that she wait awhile for me to begin my new life. I intend going to the government and asking for a post there, if I can still remember what I learned at school. As soon as I’m properly established, I will come back for her. Do you agree?”",CO026CL12
17979,469,"“If she’s happy with that,” said Vasconcelos, grasping at this one last hope, “then it’s decided.”",CO026CL12
17980,470,Gomes went on:,CO026CL12
17981,471,"“Good, speak to her about this tomorrow, and send me her response. Ah, if only I still had my fortune, then I could prove to you how much I love her.”",CO026CL12
17982,472,"“Fine, we’ll leave it at that.”",CO026CL12
17983,473,“I await your response.”,CO026CL12
17984,474,And with that they said goodbye.,CO026CL12
17985,475,Vasconcelos was left with this thought:,CO026CL12
17986,476,“The only credible part of what he said is that he now has nothing. But there’s no point in waiting: hard on hard never made a brick wall.”,CO026CL12
17987,477,"As Gomes was going down the stairs, he was saying to himself:",CO026CL12
17988,478,"“What I find odd is that he should tell me that he’s poor at precisely the moment when I’ve just discovered my own ruin. But he’ll wait in vain: in this case, two halves don’t make a whole.”",CO026CL12
17989,479,Vasconcelos went downstairs.,CO026CL12
17990,480,"His intention was to tell Augusta the result of his conversation with Adelaide’s suitor. One thing, however, was still bothering him: Augusta’s refusal to agree to Adelaide’s marriage without giving any reason.",CO026CL12
17991,481,"He was still thinking about this when, as he walked through the hall, he heard voices in the parlor.",CO026CL12
17992,482,It was Augusta talking to Carlota.,CO026CL12
17993,483,He was about to go in when these words reached his ears:,CO026CL12
17994,484,“But Adelaide’s still such a child.”,CO026CL12
17995,485,It was Augusta’s voice.,CO026CL12
17996,486,“A child!” said Carlota.,CO026CL12
17997,487,“Yes. She’s not old enough to marry.”,CO026CL12
17998,488,"“If I were you, I wouldn’t stop this marriage, even if it does take place in a few months’ time, because Gomes really doesn’t seem such a bad fellow.”",CO026CL12
17999,489,"“Oh, he isn’t, but I just don’t want Adelaide to marry.”",CO026CL12
18000,490,"Vasconcelos pressed his ear to the keyhole, anxious not to miss a single word of this dialogue.",CO026CL12
18001,491,"“What I don’t understand,” said Carlota, “is your insistence on her not marrying at all. Sooner or later, she’ll have to.”",CO026CL12
18002,492,"“Yes, but as late as possible,” said Augusta.",CO026CL12
18003,493,A silence fell.,CO026CL12
18004,494,Vasconcelos was growing impatient.,CO026CL12
18005,495,"“Oh,” Augusta went on, “if you knew how I dread Adelaide getting married.”",CO026CL12
18006,496,“But why?”,CO026CL12
18007,497,"“Why? You seem to have forgotten something, Carlota. What I dread are the children she’ll have—my grandchildren! The idea of being a grandmother, Carlota, is just too awful!”",CO026CL12
18008,498,Vasconcelos breathed a sigh of relief and opened the door.,CO026CL12
18009,499,“Oh!” cried Augusta.,CO026CL12
18010,500,"Vasconcelos bowed to Carlota, and, as soon as she left, he turned to his wife and said:",CO026CL12
18011,501,“I overheard your conversation with that woman.”,CO026CL12
18012,502,"“Well, it wasn’t a secret conversation, but what exactly did you hear?”",CO026CL12
18013,503,Vasconcelos smiled and said:,CO026CL12
18014,504,"“I heard the reason why you’re afraid. I never realized that love of one’s own beauty could lead to such egotism. The marriage to Gomes won’t now happen, but if Adelaide ever does love someone, I really don’t see how we can withhold our consent.”",CO026CL12
18015,505,"“We’ll see,” answered Augusta.",CO026CL12
18016,506,"The conversation stopped there, because these two consorts were drifting ever further apart; one was thinking about all the noisy pleasures of youth, while the other was thinking exclusively about herself.",CO026CL12
18017,507,"The following day, Gomes received a letter from Vasconcelos:",CO026CL12
18018,508,"Dear Gomes,",CO026CL12
18019,509,"Something unexpected has happened. Adelaide does not wish to marry. I tried to reason with her, but could not convince her.",CO026CL12
18020,510,"Yours, Vasconcelos",CO026CL12
18021,511,"Gomes folded up the letter and used it to light a cigar, then began thinking this deep thought:",CO026CL12
18022,512,“Where am I going to find an heiress who’ll want me as a husband?”,CO026CL12
18023,513,"If anyone knows of one, do tell him.",CO026CL12
18024,514,"Vasconcelos and Gomes still sometimes meet in the street or at the Alcazar; they talk and smoke and take each other’s arm, exactly like the friends they never were or like the rogues they are.",CO026CL12

18027,3,IT’S ELEVEN O’CLOCK in the morning.,CO026CL10
18028,4,"Dona Augusta Vasconcelos is reclining on a sofa with a book in her hand. Adelaide, her daughter, is tinkering at the piano.",CO026CL10
18029,5,“Is Papa up yet?” Adelaide asked her mother.,CO026CL10
18030,6,"“No,” Dona Augusta said, without glancing up from her book.",CO026CL10
18031,7,Adelaide left the piano and went over to her mother.,CO026CL10
18032,8,"“But it’s so late, Mama,” she said. “It’s eleven o’clock. Papa does sleep a lot.”",CO026CL10
18033,9,"Augusta put the book down on her lap and, looking at Adelaide, said:",CO026CL10
18034,10,“That’s because he came home very late.”,CO026CL10
18035,11,“I’ve noticed that now Papa’s never here to kiss me good night when I go to bed. He’s always out somewhere.”,CO026CL10
18036,12,Augusta smiled.,CO026CL10
18037,13,"“You’re still such a country bumpkin,” she said. “You go to bed at the same time as the chickens. Things are different here. Your father has things to do at night.”",CO026CL10
18038,14,"“Is it to do with politics, Mama?” asked Adelaide.",CO026CL10
18039,15,"“I don’t know,” said Augusta.",CO026CL10
18040,16,"I began by saying that Adelaide was Augusta’s daughter, and this information, so necessary to the story, was no less necessary in reality, because, at first sight, no one would ever have thought they were mother and daughter; Vasconcelos’s wife was so young that mother and daughter looked more like sisters.",CO026CL10
18041,17,"Augusta was thirty and Adelaide fifteen, but, comparatively speaking, the mother looked even younger than the daughter. She still had all the freshness of a fifteen-year-old, as well as something that Adelaide lacked: an awareness of her own beauty and youth, an awareness that would have been praiseworthy were it not combined with a vanity that was as immense as it was deep.",CO026CL10
18042,18,"She was of only average height, but nevertheless cut an imposing figure. Her skin was, at once, very pale and very rosy. She had brown hair and green eyes. Her long, shapely hands seemed made for loving caresses. Augusta, however, put her hands to better use, covering them in soft kid gloves.",CO026CL10
18043,19,"All of Augusta’s graces were there in Adelaide, but in embryonic form. You could tell that, by the time Adelaide was twenty, she would rival Augusta; meanwhile, she still retained certain childish qualities that somewhat masked those natural gifts.",CO026CL10
18044,20,"And yet a man could easily have fallen in love with her, especially if he was a poet with a liking for fifteen-year-old virgins, perhaps because she was rather pale, and poets down the ages have always had a weakness for pale women.",CO026CL10
18045,21,"Augusta dressed with supreme elegance, and while she did spend a lot of money on clothes, she made the most of those enormous expenditures, if one could describe it as “making the most” of them.",CO026CL10
18046,22,"To be fair, though, Augusta never haggled, she always paid the asking price for everything. She was proud of this, and felt that to behave otherwise was ridiculous and low-class.",CO026CL10
18047,23,"In this, Augusta both shared the sentiments and served the interests of certain traders, who agreed that it would be dishonorable to beat them down on the price of their merchandise.",CO026CL10
18048,24,"Whenever they spoke of this, Augusta’s draper would tell her:",CO026CL10
18049,25,“Asking one price and then selling the product for a lower price is tantamount to confessing that you intended to swindle your customer.”,CO026CL10
18050,26,The draper preferred to do so without confessing to anything.,CO026CL10
18051,27,"And again to be fair to Augusta, we must acknowledge that she spared no expense in ensuring that Adelaide was always dressed as elegantly as she herself was.",CO026CL10
18052,28,And this was no small task.,CO026CL10
18053,29,"From the age of five, Adelaide had been brought up in the country by some of Augusta’s relatives, who were more interested in growing coffee than in spending money on clothes, and Adelaide grew up with those habits and those ideas. This is why arriving in Rio to rejoin her family proved to be a real transformation.",CO026CL10
18054,30,"She passed from one civilization to another; she lived through several years in the space of one hour. Fortunately for her, she had an excellent teacher in her mother. Adelaide changed, and on the day this story begins, she was already quite different, although still a long way behind her mother.",CO026CL10
18055,31,"As Augusta was answering her daughter’s curious question about what Vasconcelos actually did at night, a carriage drew up at the front door.",CO026CL10
18056,32,Adelaide ran to the window.,CO026CL10
18057,33,"“It’s Dona Carlota, Mama,” she said.",CO026CL10
18058,34,"A few minutes later, Dona Carlota entered the room. To introduce readers to this new character, I need say only that she was like a volume two of Augusta: beautiful, like her; elegant, like her; vain, like her, which is to say that they were the very best of enemies.",CO026CL10
18059,35,"Carlota had come to ask Augusta to sing at a concert she was planning to give at home, a concert dreamed up purely as an opportunity to show off her magnificent new dress.",CO026CL10
18060,36,Augusta gladly accepted.,CO026CL10
18061,37,“How’s your husband?” she asked Carlota.,CO026CL10
18062,38,“He’s gone into town. And yours?”,CO026CL10
18063,39,“He’s sleeping.”,CO026CL10
18064,40,“The sleep of the just?” asked Carlota with a mischievous smile.,CO026CL10
18065,41,"“Apparently,” said Augusta.",CO026CL10
18066,42,"At this point, Adelaide, who, at Carlota’s request, had gone over to the piano to play a nocturne, rejoined them.",CO026CL10
18067,43,Augusta’s friend said to her:,CO026CL10
18068,44,“I bet you’ve already got a sweetheart in your sights.”,CO026CL10
18069,45,"Greatly embarrassed, Adelaide blushed deeply and said:",CO026CL10
18070,46,“Don’t say such things.”,CO026CL10
18071,47,"“I’m sure you do; either that or you’re getting to the age when you certainly will have a sweetheart, and I’m telling you now that he’ll be very handsome.”",CO026CL10
18072,48,"“It’s still too early for that,” said Augusta.",CO026CL10
18073,49,“Early!”,CO026CL10
18074,50,"“Yes, she’s only a child. She’ll get married when she’s ready, but that won’t be for a while yet.”",CO026CL10
18075,51,"“I see,” said Carlota, laughing, “you want to prepare her. And I entirely approve, but in that case, don’t take her dolls away from her.”",CO026CL10
18076,52,"“Oh, she’s given up dolls already.”",CO026CL10
18077,53,“Then it will be very hard to fend off any sweethearts. One thing replaces the other.”,CO026CL10
18078,54,"Augusta smiled, and Carlota got up to leave.",CO026CL10
18079,55,“Are you going already?” said Augusta.,CO026CL10
18080,56,"“Yes, I must. Bye-bye.”",CO026CL10
18081,57,“’Bye!”,CO026CL10
18082,58,"They exchanged kisses, and Carlota left.",CO026CL10
18083,59,"Immediately afterward, two delivery boys arrived: one bearing some dresses and the other a novel, all of which had been ordered the day before. The dresses had cost a fortune, and the book was Ernest-Aimé Feydeau’s novel Fanny, a satire on society manners.",CO026CL10
18084,60,II,CO026CL10
18085,61,"At about one in the afternoon that same day, Vasconcelos rose from his bed.",CO026CL10
18086,62,"He was about forty, good-looking, and endowed with a magnificent pair of graying side-whiskers, which gave him the air of a diplomat, something that he was a million miles from being. He had a smiling, expansive face, and positively oozed robust health.",CO026CL10
18087,63,"He possessed a decent fortune and did not work, or, rather, he worked very hard at squandering said fortune, with his wife as enthusiastic collaborator.",CO026CL10
18088,64,"Adelaide had been quite right about her father; he went to bed late, always woke up after midday, and left again in the evening, only to return the following morning in the early hours, which is to say that he made regular brief visits to the family home.",CO026CL10
18089,65,"Only one person had the right to demand that Vasconcelos become a more assiduous visitor, and that was Augusta; but she said nothing. They got on well enough, though, because the husband, as a reward for his wife’s tolerant behavior, denied her nothing and every whim of hers was quickly granted.",CO026CL10
18090,66,"If Vasconcelos could not accompany her to every outing and every ball, a brother of his stood in for him; Lourenço was a commander of two different orders, an opposition politician, an excellent player of ombre, and, in his few moments of leisure, a most amiable fellow.",CO026CL10
18091,67,"He was what might be described as “an awkward so-and-so,” at least as regards his brother, for while he obeyed his sister-in-law’s every order, he would address the occasional admonitory sermon to his brother. Good seed that fell on stony ground.",CO026CL10
18092,68,"Anyway, Vasconcelos had eventually woken up, and he woke in a good mood. His daughter was very pleased to see him; he spoke to his wife most affably, and she responded in kind.",CO026CL10
18093,69,"“Why do you always wake up so late?” asked Adelaide, stroking his side-whiskers.",CO026CL10
18094,70,“Because I go to bed late.”,CO026CL10
18095,71,“But why do you go to bed late?”,CO026CL10
18096,72,"“What a lot of questions!” said Vasconcelos, smiling.",CO026CL10
18097,73,Then he went on:,CO026CL10
18098,74,"“I go to bed late because my political duties require it. You don’t know what politics is: it’s something very ugly, but very necessary.”",CO026CL10
18099,75,“I do know what politics is!” said Adelaide.,CO026CL10
18100,76,"“All right, then, tell me.”",CO026CL10
18101,77,"“In the country, whenever they were beating up the magistrate, they always used to say that the motive was political, which I thought was really odd, because politically speaking, not beating him up would have made much more sense . . .”",CO026CL10
18102,78,"Vasconcelos laughed out loud at his daughter’s remark, and was just going off to have his breakfast when in came his brother, who could not resist saying:",CO026CL10
18103,79,“A fine time to be having breakfast!”,CO026CL10
18104,80,"“Don’t you start. I have my breakfast whenever I feel like it. Don’t try and pin me down to certain hours and certain meanings. Call it breakfast or lunch, I don’t mind, but whatever it is, I’m going to eat it.”",CO026CL10
18105,81,Lourenço responded by pulling a face.,CO026CL10
18106,82,"When breakfast was over, Senhor Batista arrived. Vasconcelos received him in his private study.",CO026CL10
18107,83,"Batista was twenty-five and the typical man-about-town; excellent company at a supper attended by rather dubious guests, but absolutely useless in respectable company. He was witty and quite intelligent, but he had to be in the right situation for these qualities to be revealed. Otherwise, he was handsome, sported a fine mustache, wore expensive shoes, and dressed impeccably; he also smoked like a trooper, but smoked only the finest cigars.",CO026CL10
18108,84,"“Only just woken up, have you?” Batista asked as he went into Vasconcelos’s study.",CO026CL10
18109,85,"“Yes, about three-quarters of an hour ago. I’ve just finished breakfast. Have a cigar.”",CO026CL10
18110,86,"Batista took one and sat down in a chair, while Vasconcelos struck a match.",CO026CL10
18111,87,“Have you seen Gomes?” asked Vasconcelos.,CO026CL10
18112,88,"“Yes, I saw him yesterday. The big news is that he’s given up society life.”",CO026CL10
18113,89,“Really?”,CO026CL10
18114,90,"“When I asked him why he hadn’t been seen for over a month, he told me he was undergoing a transformation, and that the Gomes he was will live on only as a memory. Incredible though it may seem, he appeared to mean it.”",CO026CL10
18115,91,“I don’t believe him. He’s having a joke at our expense. Any other news?”,CO026CL10
18116,92,"“None, not unless you’ve heard any.”",CO026CL10
18117,93,“Not a peep.”,CO026CL10
18118,94,“Come on! Didn’t you go to the Jardim yesterday?”,CO026CL10
18119,95,"“Yes, there was a supper on there . . .”",CO026CL10
18120,96,"“A family do, eh? I was at the Alcazar. What time did that ‘family supper’ end?”",CO026CL10
18121,97,“At four in the morning.”,CO026CL10
18122,98,"Vasconcelos lay down in a hammock, and the conversation continued along the same lines, until a houseboy came to tell Vasconcelos that Senhor Gomes was in the parlor.",CO026CL10
18123,99,"“Ah, the man himself!” said Batista.",CO026CL10
18124,100,"“Tell him to come up,” ordered Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18125,101,"The houseboy went back downstairs, but Gomes only joined them a quarter of an hour later, having spent some time chatting with Augusta and Adelaide.",CO026CL10
18126,102,"“Well, long time no see,” said Vasconcelos when Gomes finally entered the room.",CO026CL10
18127,103,"“You haven’t exactly searched me out,” Gomes retorted.",CO026CL10
18128,104,"“Excuse me, but I’ve been to your house twice, and twice they told me you were out.”",CO026CL10
18129,105,"“That was pure bad luck, because I hardly ever go out now.”",CO026CL10
18130,106,"“So you’ve become a hermit, have you?”",CO026CL10
18131,107,"“I’m a chrysalis at the moment, and will reemerge as a butterfly,” said Gomes, sitting down.",CO026CL10
18132,108,"“Poetry, eh? Watch out, Vasconcelos.”",CO026CL10
18133,109,"This new character, the longed-for, long-lost Gomes, appeared to be about thirty. He, Vasconcelos, and Batista were a trinity of pleasure and dissipation, bound together by an indissoluble friendship.",CO026CL10
18134,110,"When, about a month before, Gomes stopped appearing in the usual circles, everyone noticed, but only Vasconcelos and Batista really felt his absence. However, they did not try too hard to drag Gomes out of his solitude, in case there was some ulterior motive on his part.",CO026CL10
18135,111,"Nevertheless, they greeted Gomes like the prodigal son.",CO026CL10
18136,112,“Where have you been hiding? What’s all this business about chrysalises and butterflies? Who do you think you’re fooling?”,CO026CL10
18137,113,"“No, really, my friends. I’m growing wings.”",CO026CL10
18138,114,"“Wings!” said Batista, trying not to laugh.",CO026CL10
18139,115,“Only if they’re the wings of a sparrow-hawk ready to pounce on its prey . . .”,CO026CL10
18140,116,"“No, I’m serious.”",CO026CL10
18141,117,And Gomes seemed absolutely genuine.,CO026CL10
18142,118,Vasconcelos and Batista exchanged a sideways glance.,CO026CL10
18143,119,"“Well, if it’s true, tell us about these wings of yours and where exactly you want to fly,”",CO026CL10
18144,120,"said Vasconcelos, and Batista added:",CO026CL10
18145,121,"“Yes, you owe us an explanation, and if we, your family council, think it a good explanation, we will give our approval. If not, there’ll be no wings for you, and you’ll go back to being what you’ve always been.”",CO026CL10
18146,122,"“I second that,” said Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18147,123,“It’s quite simple. I’m growing angel’s wings so that I can fly up into the heaven of love.”,CO026CL10
18148,124,“Love!” exclaimed his two friends.,CO026CL10
18149,125,"“Yes, love,” said Gomes. “What have I been up until now? A complete wastrel, a total debauchee, squandering both my fortune and my heart. But is that enough to fill a life? I don’t think so.”",CO026CL10
18150,126,"“I agree, it isn’t enough, there needs to be something else, but the difference lies in how . . .”",CO026CL10
18151,127,"“Exactly,” said Vasconcelos, “exactly. It’s only natural that the two of you will think otherwise, but I believe I’m right in saying that without a chaste, pure love, life is a mere desert.”",CO026CL10
18152,128,Batista gave a start.,CO026CL10
18153,129,Vasconcelos fixed his eyes on Gomes.,CO026CL10
18154,130,"“You’re thinking of getting married, aren’t you?” he said.",CO026CL10
18155,131,"“I don’t know about marriage, I only know that I’m in love and hope one day to marry the woman I love.”",CO026CL10
18156,132,“Marry!” cried Batista.,CO026CL10
18157,133,And he let out a loud guffaw.,CO026CL10
18158,134,"Gomes was so serious, though, and insisted so gravely on his plans for his own regeneration, that the two friends ended up listening with equal seriousness.",CO026CL10
18159,135,"Gomes was speaking a strange language, entirely new on the lips of a man who, at any dionysian or aphrodisiac feast, was always the wildest and rowdiest of guests.",CO026CL10
18160,136,"“So, you’re leaving us, then?” said Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18161,137,"“Me? Yes and no. You will find me in certain salons, but never again will we meet in theaters or in houses of ill repute.”",CO026CL10
18162,138,“De profundis . . .” sang Batista.,CO026CL10
18163,139,“May we at least know where and who your Marion is?” asked Vasconcelos.,CO026CL10
18164,140,"“She’s not a Marion, she’s a Virginie. At first I merely felt fond of her, then fondness became love and is now out-and-out passion. I fought it for as long as I could, but lay down my arms in the face of a far more potent force.",CO026CL10
18165,141,"My great fear was that I would not have a soul worthy to be offered to this gentle creature, but I do, a soul as fiery and pure as it was when I was eighteen. Only the chaste eyes of a virgin could have discovered the divine pearl beneath the mud in my soul. I am being reborn a far better man than I was.”",CO026CL10
18166,142,"“The boy’s clearly insane, Vasconcelos. We should pack him off to the lunatic asylum this minute, and just in case he should suffer some new attack of madness, I’ll leave right now.”",CO026CL10
18167,143,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO026CL10
18168,144,“Where are you going?” asked Gomes.,CO026CL10
18169,145,"“I have things to do, but I’ll come and see you shortly. I want to find out if there’s still time to haul you out of the abyss.”",CO026CL10
18170,146,And with that he left.,CO026CL10
18171,147,III,CO026CL10
18172,148,"Once they were alone, Vasconcelos asked:",CO026CL10
18173,149,“So you really are in love?”,CO026CL10
18174,150,"“Yes, I am. I knew you’d find that hard to believe; I myself don’t quite believe it, and yet it’s true. I’m ending up where you began. For better or worse? For better, I think.”",CO026CL10
18175,151,“Do you intend to conceal the person’s name?”,CO026CL10
18176,152,“I’ll conceal it from everyone but you.”,CO026CL10
18177,153,"“You clearly trust me, then . . .”",CO026CL10
18178,154,Gomes smiled.,CO026CL10
18179,155,"“No,” he said, “it’s a necessary condition. You, above all men, should know the name of my heart’s chosen one, for she’s your daughter.”",CO026CL10
18180,156,“Adelaide?” asked Vasconcelos in astonishment.,CO026CL10
18181,157,"“Yes, your daughter.”",CO026CL10
18182,158,This revelation was a real bombshell. Vasconcelos had never suspected such a thing.,CO026CL10
18183,159,“Do you approve?” asked Gomes.,CO026CL10
18184,160,"Vasconcelos was thinking, and, after a few moments of silence, he said:",CO026CL10
18185,161,"“My heart approves of your choice; you’re my friend, you’re in love, and as long as she loves you . . .”",CO026CL10
18186,162,"Gomes was about to speak, but, smiling, Vasconcelos went on:",CO026CL10
18187,163,“But what about society?”,CO026CL10
18188,164,“What society?”,CO026CL10
18189,165,“The society that believes both you and me to be libertines; they’re hardly going to approve.”,CO026CL10
18190,166,"“So that’s a no, is it?” said Gomes sadly.",CO026CL10
18191,167,"“No, it’s not, you fool! It’s an objection you could rebut by declaring that society is a great slanderer and famously indiscreet. My daughter is yours, on one condition.”",CO026CL10
18192,168,“Which is?”,CO026CL10
18193,169,“Reciprocity. Does she love you?”,CO026CL10
18194,170,“I don’t know.”,CO026CL10
18195,171,“So you’re not sure . . .”,CO026CL10
18196,172,"“I really don’t know, I only know that I love her and would give my life for her, but I have no idea if my feelings are requited.”",CO026CL10
18197,173,"“They will be. I’ll test the waters. In two days’ time, I’ll give you my answer. To think you could be my son-in-law . . .”",CO026CL10
18198,174,Gomes’s response was to fall into his friend’s arms. The scene was verging on the comic when three o’clock struck. Gomes remembered that he’d arranged to meet another friend. Vasconcelos remembered that he had to write some letters.,CO026CL10
18199,175,Gomes left without speaking to the two ladies.,CO026CL10
18200,176,"At about four o’clock, Vasconcelos was preparing to go out, when he was told that Senhor José Brito had come to see him.",CO026CL10
18201,177,"When he heard this name, the normally jovial Vasconcelos frowned.",CO026CL10
18202,178,"Shortly afterward, Senhor José Brito entered his study.",CO026CL10
18203,179,"Senhor José Brito was, as far as Vasconcelos was concerned, a specter, an echo from the abyss, the voice of reality—a creditor.",CO026CL10
18204,180,"“I wasn’t expecting to see you today,” said Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18205,181,"“I’m surprised,” answered Senhor José Brito with a kind of piercing calm, “because today is the twenty-first.”",CO026CL10
18206,182,"“I thought it was the nineteenth,” stammered Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18207,183,"“The day before yesterday it was, but today is the twenty-first. Look,” said the creditor, picking up the Jornal do Commercio lying on a chair, “Thursday the twenty-first.”",CO026CL10
18208,184,“Have you come for the money?”,CO026CL10
18209,185,"“Here’s the bill of exchange,” said Senhor José Brito, taking his wallet out of his pocket and a piece of paper out of the wallet.",CO026CL10
18210,186,"“Why didn’t you come earlier?” asked Vasconcelos, trying to put off the evil hour.",CO026CL10
18211,187,"“I came at eight o’clock this morning,” replied the creditor, “and you were asleep; I came at nine, idem; I came at ten, idem; I came at eleven, idem; I came at noon, idem. I could have come at one o’clock, but I had to send a man to prison and I couldn’t get away any earlier. At three, I had my dinner, and here I am at four o’clock.”",CO026CL10
18212,188,Vasconcelos took a puff on his cigar to see if he could come up with some clever way of avoiding making a payment he had not been expecting.,CO026CL10
18213,189,"Nothing occurred to him, but then the creditor himself gave him an opening.",CO026CL10
18214,190,"“Besides,” he said, “the time hardly matters, since I was sure you would pay me.”",CO026CL10
18215,191,"“Ah,” said Vasconcelos, “that explains it. I wasn’t expecting you today, you see, and so I don’t have the money with me.”",CO026CL10
18216,192,"“What’s to be done, then?” asked the creditor innocently.",CO026CL10
18217,193,Vasconcelos felt a glimmer of hope.,CO026CL10
18218,194,“You could wait until tomorrow.”,CO026CL10
18219,195,"“Ah, tomorrow I’m hoping to be present at the confiscation of assets from an individual I took to court for a very large debt, so I’m afraid I can’t . . .”",CO026CL10
18220,196,"“I see, well, in that case, I’ll bring the money to your house.”",CO026CL10
18221,197,"“That would be fine if business worked like that. If we were friends, then obviously I would accept your promise and it would all be settled tomorrow, but I’m your creditor, and my one aim is to protect my own interests. Therefore, I think it would be best if you paid me today.”",CO026CL10
18222,198,Vasconcelos smoothed his hair with one hand.,CO026CL10
18223,199,“But I don’t have the money!” he said.,CO026CL10
18224,200,"“Yes, that must be very awkward for you, but it doesn’t upset me in the least; that is, it ought to upset me a little, because you clearly find yourself in a very precarious situation.”",CO026CL10
18225,201,“Do I?”,CO026CL10
18226,202,"“Indeed. Your properties in Rua da Imperatriz are mortgaged up to the hilt; the house in Rua de São Pedro was sold, and the money from the sale long since spent; your slaves have all left one by one, without you even noticing, and you recently spent a vast amount on setting up house for a certain lady of dubious reputation. You see, I know it all. More than you do yourself.”",CO026CL10
18227,203,Vasconcelos was visibly terrified.,CO026CL10
18228,204,The creditor was telling the truth.,CO026CL10
18229,205,"“But,” said Vasconcelos, “what are we to do?”",CO026CL10
18230,206,"“That’s easy enough, we double the debt, and you give me a deposit right now.”",CO026CL10
18231,207,"“Double the debt, but that’s—”",CO026CL10
18232,208,"“Throwing you a lifeline. I’m really being very reasonable. Come on, say yes. Write me a note for the deposit now and we’ll tear up the bill of exchange.”",CO026CL10
18233,209,"Vasconcelos tried to object, but it was impossible to convince Senhor José Brito.",CO026CL10
18234,210,He signed a note for eighteen contos.,CO026CL10
18235,211,"When his creditor left, Vasconcelos began thinking seriously about his life.",CO026CL10
18236,212,"Up until then, he had spent so wildly and so blindly that he hadn’t noticed the abyss he himself had dug beneath his feet.",CO026CL10
18237,213,It had taken the voice of one of his executioners to alert him to this.,CO026CL10
18238,214,"Vasconcelos pondered, calculated, and went through all his expenses and his obligations, and saw that he had less than a quarter of his fortune left—a mere pittance if he were to continue living as he had until now.",CO026CL10
18239,215,What to do?,CO026CL10
18240,216,Vasconcelos picked up his hat and went out.,CO026CL10
18241,217,It was growing dark.,CO026CL10
18242,218,"After walking for some time, deep in thought, he went into the Alcazar.",CO026CL10
18243,219,It was a way of distracting himself.,CO026CL10
18244,220,There he found the usual people.,CO026CL10
18245,221,Batista came to greet his friend.,CO026CL10
18246,222,“Why the glum face?” he asked.,CO026CL10
18247,223,"And for want of a better answer, Vasconcelos replied: “Oh, it’s nothing. Someone just stepped on a corn.”",CO026CL10
18248,224,"However, a chiropodist standing nearby heard this remark and thereafter did not take his eyes off poor Vasconcelos, who was in a particularly sensitive mood that night. In the end, he found the chiropodist’s insistent gaze so troubling that he left.",CO026CL10
18249,225,"He went to the Hotel de Milão to have supper. However preoccupied he might be, his stomach was still making its usual demands.",CO026CL10
18250,226,"In the middle of eating, he suddenly remembered the one thing he should never have forgotten: Gomes’s proposal of marriage to his daughter.",CO026CL10
18251,227,It was like a ray of sunshine.,CO026CL10
18252,228,"“Gomes is rich,” thought Vasconcelos. “That’s the best way out of all these problems. Gomes can marry Adelaide, and, since he’s my friend, he couldn’t possibly deny me what I need. For my part, I will try to get back what I’ve lost. What a stroke of luck!”",CO026CL10
18253,229,"Vasconcelos continued his meal in the best of moods, then returned to the Alcazar, where a few other lads and some members of the female sex helped him to forget his troubles completely.",CO026CL10
18254,230,He returned peacefully home at his regular time of three o’clock in the morning.,CO026CL10
18255,231,IV,CO026CL10
18256,232,"The following day, Vasconcelos’s first priority was to sound out Adelaide. He wanted to do so, though, when Augusta was not there. Fortunately, she needed to go to Rua da Quitanda to view some new fabrics, and she set off with her brother-in-law, leaving Vasconcelos entirely free.",CO026CL10
18257,233,"As readers will already know, Adelaide loved her father deeply, and would do anything for him. She was, moreover, the soul of kindness. Vasconcelos was counting on those two qualities.",CO026CL10
18258,234,"“Come here, Adelaide,” he said, going into the living room. “How old are you now?”",CO026CL10
18259,235,“Fifteen.”,CO026CL10
18260,236,“Do you know how old your mother is?”,CO026CL10
18261,237,"“She’s twenty-seven, isn’t she?”",CO026CL10
18262,238,"“No, she’s thirty, which means that your mother married when she was just fifteen.”",CO026CL10
18263,239,"Vasconcelos paused to gauge the effect of these words, but in vain. Adelaide had no idea what he was getting at.",CO026CL10
18264,240,Her father went on:,CO026CL10
18265,241,“Have you considered marriage?”,CO026CL10
18266,242,"She blushed deeply and said nothing, but when her father insisted, she answered:",CO026CL10
18267,243,"“Oh, Papa, I don’t want to marry.”",CO026CL10
18268,244,“You don’t want to marry? Whyever not?”,CO026CL10
18269,245,“Because I don’t want to. I’m happy living here.”,CO026CL10
18270,246,“You could marry and still live here.”,CO026CL10
18271,247,"“Yes, but I don’t want to.”",CO026CL10
18272,248,"“Come on, you’re in love with someone, aren’t you? Admit it.”",CO026CL10
18273,249,"“Don’t ask me such things, Papa. I’m not in love with anyone.”",CO026CL10
18274,250,Adelaide sounded so genuine that Vasconcelos could not doubt her sincerity.,CO026CL10
18275,251,"“She’s telling the truth,” he thought. “I need to try another tack.”",CO026CL10
18276,252,Adelaide sat down next to him and said:,CO026CL10
18277,253,"“So can we just not talk about this anymore, Papa?”",CO026CL10
18278,254,"“We must talk, my dear. You’re still a child and can’t yet look to the future. Imagine if I and your mother were to die tomorrow. Who would look after you? Only a husband.”",CO026CL10
18279,255,“But there’s no one I like.”,CO026CL10
18280,256,"“Not at the moment, but if your fiancé were a handsome lad with a good heart, you would come to like him. I’ve already chosen someone who loves you deeply, and you’ll come to love him too.”",CO026CL10
18281,257,Adelaide shuddered.,CO026CL10
18282,258,“I will?” she said. “But who is it?”,CO026CL10
18283,259,“Gomes.”,CO026CL10
18284,260,"“But I don’t love him, Papa.”",CO026CL10
18285,261,"“Not now, I’m sure, but you can’t deny that he’s worthy of being loved. In a couple of months you’ll be madly in love with him.”",CO026CL10
18286,262,"Adelaide said not a word. She bowed her head and started playing with one of her thick, dark plaits. She was breathing hard and staring down at the carpet.",CO026CL10
18287,263,"“So that’s agreed, is it?” asked Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18288,264,"“But, Papa, what if I was unhappy?”",CO026CL10
18289,265,"“That’s impossible, my dear. You will be happy and you’ll adore your husband.”",CO026CL10
18290,266,"“Oh, Papa,” said Adelaide, her eyes brimming with tears, “please don’t make me marry yet.”",CO026CL10
18291,267,"“Adelaide, a daughter’s first duty is to obey her father, and I’m your father. I want you to marry Gomes and you will marry him.”",CO026CL10
18292,268,"To have their full effect, these words needed to be followed by a quick exit. Vasconcelos knew this and immediately departed, leaving Adelaide in deep despair.",CO026CL10
18293,269,"She didn’t love anyone. No other love object lay behind her refusal, nor did she feel any particular aversion for her would-be suitor.",CO026CL10
18294,270,She merely felt complete indifference.,CO026CL10
18295,271,"In the circumstances, marriage could only be a hateful imposition.",CO026CL10
18296,272,But what could Adelaide do? Who could she turn to?,CO026CL10
18297,273,She had only her tears.,CO026CL10
18298,274,"As for Vasconcelos, he went up to his study and wrote the following lines to his future son-in-law:",CO026CL10
18299,275,"Everything is going well. I give you permission to come and pay court to my daughter, and hope to see you married in a couple of months.",CO026CL10
18300,276,He sealed the letter and sent it off.,CO026CL10
18301,277,"Shortly afterward, Augusta and Lourenço returned.",CO026CL10
18302,278,"While Augusta disappeared up to her boudoir to change her clothes, Lourenço went looking for Adelaide, who was out in the garden.",CO026CL10
18303,279,"Noticing that her eyes were red, he asked her why, but she denied she had been crying.",CO026CL10
18304,280,Lourenço didn’t believe his niece and urged her to tell him what was wrong.,CO026CL10
18305,281,"Adelaide trusted her uncle, almost because he was so direct and gruff. After a few minutes, Adelaide told Lourenço all about the scene with her father.",CO026CL10
18306,282,"“So that’s why you’re crying, little one.”",CO026CL10
18307,283,“Yes. How can I avoid getting married?”,CO026CL10
18308,284,"“Don’t worry, you won’t have to. I promise.”",CO026CL10
18309,285,Adelaide felt a shiver of joy.,CO026CL10
18310,286,"“Do you promise, Uncle, to persuade Papa?”",CO026CL10
18311,287,"“Well, persuade or prevail, one or the other, but you won’t have to get married. Your father is a fool.”",CO026CL10
18312,288,Lourenço went up to see Vasconcelos at precisely the moment when the latter was about to leave.,CO026CL10
18313,289,“Are you going out?” asked Lourenço.,CO026CL10
18314,290,“I am.”,CO026CL10
18315,291,“I need to talk to you.”,CO026CL10
18316,292,"Lourenço sat down, and Vasconcelos, who already had his hat on, stood waiting for him to speak.",CO026CL10
18317,293,"“Sit down,” said Lourenço.",CO026CL10
18318,294,Vasconcelos sat down.,CO026CL10
18319,295,“Sixteen years ago—”,CO026CL10
18320,296,"“You’re going an awfully long way back. If you don’t shave off half a dozen years, I can’t promise to hear you out.”",CO026CL10
18321,297,"“Sixteen years ago,” Lourenço went on, “you got married, but the difference between that first day and today is enormous.”",CO026CL10
18322,298,"“Of course,” said Vasconcelos. “Tempora mutantur, nos et—”",CO026CL10
18323,299,"“At the time,” Lourenço went on, “you said you’d found paradise, a true paradise, and for two or three years you were a model husband. Then you changed completely, and paradise would have become a real hell if your wife were not the cold, indifferent creature she is, thus avoiding some truly terrible domestic scenes.”",CO026CL10
18324,300,"“But what has this got to do with you, Lourenço?”",CO026CL10
18325,301,"“Nothing, and that isn’t what I wanted to talk to you about. What I want to do is to stop you sacrificing your daughter on a whim, handing her over to one of your fellow dissolutes.”",CO026CL10
18326,302,Vasconcelos sprang to his feet:,CO026CL10
18327,303,"“You must be insane,” he said.",CO026CL10
18328,304,"“No, I’m perfectly sane and prudently advising you not to sacrifice your daughter to a libertine.”",CO026CL10
18329,305,"“Gomes isn’t a libertine. True, he’s led the life of many a young man, but he loves Adelaide and is a reformed character. It’s a good marriage, and that’s why I think we must all accept it. That’s what I want, and I’m the one who gives the orders around here.”",CO026CL10
18330,306,"Lourenço was about to say more, but Vasconcelos had left.",CO026CL10
18331,307,“What can I do?” thought Lourenço.,CO026CL10
18332,308,V,CO026CL10
18333,309,"Vasconcelos was not greatly bothered by Lourenço’s opposition to his plans. He could, it’s true, sow the seeds of resistance in his niece’s mind, but Adelaide was easily persuaded and would agree with whoever she happened to be speaking to, and the advice she received one day would easily be overthrown by any contrary advice she was given the following day.",CO026CL10
18334,310,"Still, it would be wise to get Augusta’s support. Vasconcelos decided to do this as soon as possible.",CO026CL10
18335,311,"Meanwhile, he needed to organize his own affairs, and so he found a lawyer, to whom he gave all the necessary documents and information, charging him with providing the necessary guidance and advising him on what measures he could take to oppose any claims made against him because of his debts or his mortgages.",CO026CL10
18336,312,None of this should make you think that Vasconcelos was about to change his ways. He was simply preparing himself to continue life as before.,CO026CL10
18337,313,"Two days after his conversation with his brother, Vasconcelos went in search of Augusta, in order to speak frankly with her about Adelaide’s marriage.",CO026CL10
18338,314,"During that time, the future bridegroom, taking Vasconcelos’s advice, was already paying court to Adelaide. If the marriage was not forced on her, it was just possible that she might end up liking the lad. Besides, Gomes was a handsome, elegant fellow and knew how to impress a woman.",CO026CL10
18339,315,Would Augusta have noticed his unusually assiduous presence in the house? That was the question Vasconcelos was asking himself as he went into his wife’s boudoir.,CO026CL10
18340,316,“Are you going out?” he asked her.,CO026CL10
18341,317,"“No, I’m expecting a visitor.”",CO026CL10
18342,318,"“Oh, who?”",CO026CL10
18343,319,"“Seabra’s wife,” she said.",CO026CL10
18344,320,Vasconcelos sat down and tried to find a way of beginning the special conversation that had brought him there.,CO026CL10
18345,321,“You’re looking very pretty today!”,CO026CL10
18346,322,"“Really?” she said, smiling. “Well, I’m no different today than on any other day, and it’s odd that you should pick today to say so.”",CO026CL10
18347,323,"“No, I mean it, you’re even prettier than usual, so much so, that I could almost feel jealous.”",CO026CL10
18348,324,"“Come, now!” said Augusta with an ironic smile.",CO026CL10
18349,325,"Vasconcelos scratched his head, took out his watch, wound it up, tugged at his beard, picked up a newspaper, read a couple of advertisements, then threw the paper down on the floor; finally, after a rather long silence, he thought it best to make a frontal assault on the citadel.",CO026CL10
18350,326,"“I’ve been thinking about Adelaide,” he said.",CO026CL10
18351,327,“Why’s that?”,CO026CL10
18352,328,“She’s a young woman—”,CO026CL10
18353,329,“A young woman!” exclaimed Augusta. “She’s still a child.”,CO026CL10
18354,330,“She’s older than you were when you got married.”,CO026CL10
18355,331,Augusta frowned slightly.,CO026CL10
18356,332,“What are you getting at?” she asked.,CO026CL10
18357,333,"“What I’m getting at is that I want to make her happy by seeing her happily married. Some days ago, a very worthy young man asked me for her hand and I said yes. When I tell you the young man’s name, I’m sure you’ll approve. It’s Gomes. They should marry, don’t you think?”",CO026CL10
18358,334,“Certainly not!” retorted Augusta.,CO026CL10
18359,335,“Why not?”,CO026CL10
18360,336,“Adelaide’s just a child. She’s not old enough or sensible enough yet. She’ll marry when the time is right.”,CO026CL10
18361,337,“When the time is right? Are you sure the young man will wait that long?”,CO026CL10
18362,338,"“Patience,” said Augusta.",CO026CL10
18363,339,“Do you have something against Gomes?”,CO026CL10
18364,340,"“No. He’s a distinguished enough young fellow, but he’s not right for Adelaide.”",CO026CL10
18365,341,"Vasconcelos hesitated before continuing; it seemed to him there was no point in going on. However, the thought of Gomes’s fortune gave him courage, and he asked:",CO026CL10
18366,342,“Why isn’t he?”,CO026CL10
18367,343,"“Are you so very sure he’s right for Adelaide?” said Augusta, avoiding her husband’s question.",CO026CL10
18368,344,"“Yes, I am.”",CO026CL10
18369,345,"“Well, whether he’s right or not, she shouldn’t get married now.”",CO026CL10
18370,346,“What if she were in love?”,CO026CL10
18371,347,“What does that matter? She’ll wait!”,CO026CL10
18372,348,"“I have to tell you, Augusta, that we can’t let this marriage pass us by. It’s an absolute necessity.”",CO026CL10
18373,349,“An absolute necessity? I don’t understand.”,CO026CL10
18374,350,“Let me explain. Gomes has a large fortune.”,CO026CL10
18375,351,“So do we.”,CO026CL10
18376,352,"“That’s where you’re wrong,” said Vasconcelos, interrupting her.",CO026CL10
18377,353,“How so?”,CO026CL10
18378,354,Vasconcelos went on:,CO026CL10
18379,355,"“You’d have to find out sooner or later, and I think this is the moment to tell you the truth, and the truth is that we’re poor, ruined.”",CO026CL10
18380,356,"Augusta heard these words, her eyes wide with horror.",CO026CL10
18381,357,“It’s not possible!”,CO026CL10
18382,358,"“Unfortunately, it is.”",CO026CL10
18383,359,A silence fell.,CO026CL10
18384,360,"“There, I’ve got her,” thought Vasconcelos.",CO026CL10
18385,361,Augusta broke the silence.,CO026CL10
18386,362,"“But if our fortune has gone, I’d have thought you would have something better to do than sit around talking about it; you need to rebuild that fortune.”",CO026CL10
18387,363,"Vasconcelos gave her a look of utter astonishment, and as if this look were a question, Augusta quickly added:",CO026CL10
18388,364,“Don’t look so surprised. I think it’s your duty to rebuild our fortune.”,CO026CL10
18389,365,"“That isn’t what surprises me, what I find surprising is that you should put it like that. Anyone would think I was to blame.”",CO026CL10
18390,366,"“Oh,” said Augusta, “I suppose you’re going to say that I am.”",CO026CL10
18391,367,"“If blame there is, then we’re both to blame.”",CO026CL10
18392,368,"“What, me too?”",CO026CL10
18393,369,"“Yes, you too. Your wildly extravagant spending sprees have been a major contributor to our downfall; and since I’ve denied you nothing and still deny you nothing, I take full responsibility. And if that’s what you’re throwing in my face, then I agree.”",CO026CL10
18394,370,Augusta gave an angry shrug and shot Vasconcelos a look of such scorn that it would have been valid grounds for divorce.,CO026CL10
18395,371,Vasconcelos saw the shrug and the look.,CO026CL10
18396,372,"“A love of luxury and excess,” he said, “will always have the same consequences, which are terrible, but perfectly understandable. The only way of avoiding them is to live more moderately, but that never even occurred to you. After six months of married life, you plunged into the whirlwind of fashion, and your little stream of expenditures became a vast river of profligacy.",CO026CL10
18397,373,Do you know what my brother said to me once? He said that the reason you sent Adelaide off to the country was so that you would be free to live with no obligations of any kind.”,CO026CL10
18398,374,Augusta had stood up and taken a few steps across the room; she was pale and trembling.,CO026CL10
18399,375,"Vasconcelos was continuing this litany of recriminations, when his wife interrupted him, saying:",CO026CL10
18400,376,“And why did you not put a stop to my extravagance?”,CO026CL10
18401,377,“For the sake of domestic harmony.”,CO026CL10
18402,378,"“Lies!” she cried. “You wanted to live a free and independent life. Seeing me embarking on that life of excess, you thought you could buy my tolerance of your behavior by tolerating mine. That was the only reason. The way you live may be different from mine, but it’s far worse. I may have squandered money at home, but you did the same out in the street.",CO026CL10
18403,379,"There’s no point denying it, because I know everything; I know all the names of the succession of rivals you’ve given me, and I never said a word, and I’m not censuring you now, that would be pointless and too late.”",CO026CL10
18404,380,"The situation had changed. Vasconcelos had begun as judge and ended up as codefendant. It was impossible to deny, and arguing was risky and futile. He preferred to appear reasonable, even cajoling.",CO026CL10
18405,381,"“Given the facts (and I accept that you’re right), we are clearly both to blame, and I see no reason to lay all the blame on me. I should rebuild our fortune, I agree. And one way of doing that is to marry Adelaide off to Gomes.”",CO026CL10
18406,382,"“No,” said Augusta.",CO026CL10
18407,383,"“Fine, then, we’ll be poor and even worse off than we are now; we’ll sell everything . . .”",CO026CL10
18408,384,"“Forgive me,” said Augusta, “but I don’t understand why you, a strong young man, who clearly played the larger role in bringing about this disaster, cannot throw yourself into rebuilding our squandered fortune.”",CO026CL10
18409,385,"“It would take a very long time, and meanwhile life goes on and we keep spending. As I’ve said, the best way out of this is to marry Adelaide off to Gomes.”",CO026CL10
18410,386,"“No, I don’t want that,” said Augusta, “I won’t consent to such a marriage.”",CO026CL10
18411,387,"Vasconcelos was about to respond, but Augusta, having uttered these words, had flounced out of the room.",CO026CL10
18412,388,Vasconcelos followed a few minutes later.,CO026CL10
18413,389,VI,CO026CL10
18414,390,"Lourenço knew nothing about this scene between his brother and sister-in-law, and, given Vasconcelos’s stubbornness, he had decided to say nothing more; however, since he was very fond of his niece and did not want to see her handed over to a man of whose habits he disapproved, he decided to wait until the situation took a more decisive turn and only then play a more active role.",CO026CL10
18415,391,"In order not to waste time, though, and possibly to gain the use of some potentially powerful weapon, Lourenço began an investigation intended to gather detailed information on Gomes.",CO026CL10
18416,392,"Gomes, for his part, believed the marriage to be a certainty, and did not waste a moment in his conquest of Adelaide.",CO026CL10
18417,393,"He could not fail to notice, however, that for no reason he could ascertain, her mother Augusta was becoming increasingly cold and indifferent, and it occurred to him that she was possibly the source of some opposition.",CO026CL10
18418,394,"As for Vasconcelos, discouraged by the discussion in his wife’s boudoir, he was hoping for better days and depending, above all, on the sheer force of necessity.",CO026CL10
18419,395,"One day, however, exactly forty-eight hours after his argument with Augusta, he asked himself this question:",CO026CL10
18420,396,“Why is Augusta refusing to give Adelaide to Gomes in marriage?”,CO026CL10
18421,397,"One question led to another, one deduction led to another, and a painful suspicion took root in Vasconcelos’s mind.",CO026CL10
18422,398,“Does she perhaps love him?” he wondered.,CO026CL10
18423,399,"Then, as if one abyss attracted another abyss, and one suspicion called to another suspicion, Vasconcelos thought:",CO026CL10
18424,400,“Were they once lovers?”,CO026CL10
18425,401,"For the first time, Vasconcelos felt the serpent of jealousy biting his heart.",CO026CL10
18426,402,"I say “jealousy” for want of a better word, because I don’t know if what he was feeling was jealousy or merely wounded pride.",CO026CL10
18427,403,Could Vasconcelos’s suspicions have any basis in fact?,CO026CL10
18428,404,"To be honest, no. However vain Augusta might be, she remained faithful to her unfaithful husband, and for two reasons: her conscience and her temperament. Even if she hadn’t been convinced of her duty as a wife, she would never break her wedding vows.",CO026CL10
18429,405,"She was not made for passions, apart from the ridiculous passions aroused by vanity. She loved her own beauty above all things, and her best friend was whoever would tell her she was the most beautiful of women; and yet, while she would give away her friendship, she would never give away her heart, and this is what saved her.",CO026CL10
18430,406,"And there you have the truth: But who would tell Vasconcelos? Once he began to suspect that his honor was at risk, Vasconcelos started to review his whole life. Gomes had been a visitor to his house for six years and was free to come and go as he liked.",CO026CL10
18431,407,"An act of betrayal would be easy enough. Vasconcelos recalled words, gestures, glances, none of which had been of any significance before, but which, now, began to look suspicious.",CO026CL10
18432,408,"For two days, Vasconcelos was consumed by these thoughts. He did not leave the house, and whenever Gomes arrived, he would observe his wife with unusual interest; even the coldness with which she received Gomes was, in her husband’s eyes, proof of the crime.",CO026CL10
18433,409,"Then, on the morning of the third day (Vasconcelos now rose early), his brother came into his study, looking his usual disapproving self.",CO026CL10
18434,410,Lourenço’s presence prompted Vasconcelos to reveal everything to him.,CO026CL10
18435,411,"Lourenço was a man of good sense and, when necessary, could be supportive too.",CO026CL10
18436,412,"He listened to Vasconcelos, and when the latter had finished, he broke his silence with these words:",CO026CL10
18437,413,"“This is pure nonsense. If your wife is against the marriage, then it’s for some other reason.”",CO026CL10
18438,414,“But it’s the marriage to Gomes she’s objecting to.”,CO026CL10
18439,415,"“Yes, because you presented Gomes to her as the suitor, but she might well have reacted in the same way if you had suggested someone else. There must be another reason; perhaps Adelaide has spoken to her and asked her to oppose the marriage, because your daughter doesn’t love Gomes and can’t marry him.”",CO026CL10
18440,416,“But she will.”,CO026CL10
18441,417,"“That’s not the only reason she can’t marry him, though . . .”",CO026CL10
18442,418,“Go on.”,CO026CL10
18443,419,“There’s also the fact that the marriage is pure speculation on Gomes’s part.”,CO026CL10
18444,420,“Speculation?” asked Vasconcelos.,CO026CL10
18445,421,"“Just as it is for you,” said Lourenço. “You’re giving him your daughter because you have your eyes on his fortune; and he will take her because he has his eyes on yours . . .”",CO026CL10
18446,422,“But he—”,CO026CL10
18447,423,"“He has nothing. He’s ruined like you. I did a little investigating and learned the truth. Naturally, he wants to continue the same dissolute life he has led up until now, and your fortune is a way to do that.”",CO026CL10
18448,424,“Are you sure of this?”,CO026CL10
18449,425,“Absolutely.”,CO026CL10
18450,426,"Vasconcelos was terrified. In the midst of all his suspicions, he had still clung to the hope that his honor would be saved and that the marriage would set him up financially.",CO026CL10
18451,427,Lourenço’s revelation put paid to that hope.,CO026CL10
18452,428,"“If you want proof, send for him and tell him you’re penniless and, for that reason, cannot allow him to marry your daughter. Observe him closely and see what effect your words have on him.”",CO026CL10
18453,429,"There was no need to summon the suitor. An hour later, he called at the house.",CO026CL10
18454,430,Vasconcelos told him to come straight up to his study.,CO026CL10
18455,431,VII,CO026CL10
18456,432,"After an initial exchange of courtesies, Vasconcelos said:",CO026CL10
18457,433,“I was just about to write and ask you to come.”,CO026CL10
18458,434,“Why’s that?” asked Gomes.,CO026CL10
18459,435,“So that we could talk about . . . about the marriage.”,CO026CL10
18460,436,"“Ah, is there a problem?”",CO026CL10
18461,437,“I’ll explain.”,CO026CL10
18462,438,"Gomes grew more serious, foreseeing some grave difficulty.",CO026CL10
18463,439,Vasconcelos spoke first.,CO026CL10
18464,440,"“There are certain circumstances,” he said, “that need to be set out very clearly, so that there can be no room for misunderstanding . . .”",CO026CL10
18465,441,“I agree entirely.”,CO026CL10
18466,442,“Do you love my daughter?”,CO026CL10
18467,443,"“How often do I have to tell you? Yes, I do.”",CO026CL10
18468,444,“And you will love her whatever the circumstances?”,CO026CL10
18469,445,"“Yes, unless those circumstances might affect her happiness.”",CO026CL10
18470,446,"“Let’s be frank, then, since, as well as the friend you have always been, you are now almost my son. For us to be discreet would be decidedly indiscreet.”",CO026CL10
18471,447,"“Indeed,” said Gomes.",CO026CL10
18472,448,"“I’ve just found out that my financial affairs are in a parlous state. I have overspent and am basically ruined, and it would be no exaggeration to say that I am now poor.”",CO026CL10
18473,449,Gomes did his best not to look shocked.,CO026CL10
18474,450,"“Adelaide,” Vasconcelos went on, “has no fortune, not even a dowry. All I am giving you is a young woman, although I can promise you that she’s a real angel and will make an excellent wife.”",CO026CL10
18475,451,"Vasconcelos fell silent, his eyes fixed on Gomes, as if, by scrutinizing his face he might discover what was going on in his heart.",CO026CL10
18476,452,"Gomes should have responded at once, but, for a few minutes, a deep silence reigned.",CO026CL10
18477,453,"Finally, he spoke.",CO026CL10
18478,454,“I appreciate your frankness and I will be equally frank.”,CO026CL10
18479,455,“I would expect no less.”,CO026CL10
18480,456,"“It was certainly not money that prompted my love for your daughter; I trust you will do me the justice of believing that I am above such base considerations. Besides, on the day when I asked you for the hand of my beloved, I believed myself to be rich.”",CO026CL10
18481,457,“Believed?”,CO026CL10
18482,458,"“Yes, only yesterday, my lawyer told me the true state of my financial affairs.”",CO026CL10
18483,459,"“Not good, eh?”",CO026CL10
18484,460,"“Oh, if only it were as simple as that. But it seems that for the last six months I have been existing thanks entirely to my lawyer’s extraordinary efforts to scrape together some money, because he couldn’t bring himself to tell me the truth. And I only found out yesterday!”",CO026CL10
18485,461,“I see.”,CO026CL10
18486,462,"“Imagine the despair of a man who believes himself to be wealthy and, one day, discovers he has nothing!”",CO026CL10
18487,463,“I don’t need to imagine it!”,CO026CL10
18488,464,"“I came here today feeling happy, because any happiness I still have resides in this house; but the truth is that I’m poised on the edge of an abyss. Fate has chosen to punish us both at the same moment.”",CO026CL10
18489,465,"After this explanation, to which Vasconcelos listened unblinking, Gomes tackled the thorniest part of the matter.",CO026CL10
18490,466,"“As I say, I appreciate your frankness and I accept your daughter even without a fortune. I have no fortune, either, but I am still strong enough to work.”",CO026CL10
18491,467,"“You accept her, then?”",CO026CL10
18492,468,"“Listen, I accept Dona Adelaide on one condition: that she wait awhile for me to begin my new life. I intend going to the government and asking for a post there, if I can still remember what I learned at school. As soon as I’m properly established, I will come back for her. Do you agree?”",CO026CL10
18493,469,"“If she’s happy with that,” said Vasconcelos, grasping at this one last hope, “then it’s decided.”",CO026CL10
18494,470,Gomes went on:,CO026CL10
18495,471,"“Good, speak to her about this tomorrow, and send me her response. Ah, if only I still had my fortune, then I could prove to you how much I love her.”",CO026CL10
18496,472,"“Fine, we’ll leave it at that.”",CO026CL10
18497,473,“I await your response.”,CO026CL10
18498,474,And with that they said goodbye.,CO026CL10
18499,475,Vasconcelos was left with this thought:,CO026CL10
18500,476,“The only credible part of what he said is that he now has nothing. But there’s no point in waiting: hard on hard never made a brick wall.”,CO026CL10
18501,477,"As Gomes was going down the stairs, he was saying to himself:",CO026CL10
18502,478,"“What I find odd is that he should tell me that he’s poor at precisely the moment when I’ve just discovered my own ruin. But he’ll wait in vain: in this case, two halves don’t make a whole.”",CO026CL10
18503,479,Vasconcelos went downstairs.,CO026CL10
18504,480,"His intention was to tell Augusta the result of his conversation with Adelaide’s suitor. One thing, however, was still bothering him: Augusta’s refusal to agree to Adelaide’s marriage without giving any reason.",CO026CL10
18505,481,"He was still thinking about this when, as he walked through the hall, he heard voices in the parlor.",CO026CL10
18506,482,It was Augusta talking to Carlota.,CO026CL10
18507,483,He was about to go in when these words reached his ears:,CO026CL10
18508,484,“But Adelaide’s still such a child.”,CO026CL10
18509,485,It was Augusta’s voice.,CO026CL10
18510,486,“A child!” said Carlota.,CO026CL10
18511,487,“Yes. She’s not old enough to marry.”,CO026CL10
18512,488,"“If I were you, I wouldn’t stop this marriage, even if it does take place in a few months’ time, because Gomes really doesn’t seem such a bad fellow.”",CO026CL10
18513,489,"“Oh, he isn’t, but I just don’t want Adelaide to marry.”",CO026CL10
18514,490,"Vasconcelos pressed his ear to the keyhole, anxious not to miss a single word of this dialogue.",CO026CL10
18515,491,"“What I don’t understand,” said Carlota, “is your insistence on her not marrying at all. Sooner or later, she’ll have to.”",CO026CL10
18516,492,"“Yes, but as late as possible,” said Augusta.",CO026CL10
18517,493,A silence fell.,CO026CL10
18518,494,Vasconcelos was growing impatient.,CO026CL10
18519,495,"“Oh,” Augusta went on, “if you knew how I dread Adelaide getting married.”",CO026CL10
18520,496,“But why?”,CO026CL10
18521,497,"“Why? You seem to have forgotten something, Carlota. What I dread are the children she’ll have—my grandchildren! The idea of being a grandmother, Carlota, is just too awful!”",CO026CL10
18522,498,Vasconcelos breathed a sigh of relief and opened the door.,CO026CL10
18523,499,“Oh!” cried Augusta.,CO026CL10
18524,500,"Vasconcelos bowed to Carlota, and, as soon as she left, he turned to his wife and said:",CO026CL10
18525,501,“I overheard your conversation with that woman.”,CO026CL10

18541,3,"I HAVE SET OUT ABOVE the events that occurred in the city of Fucheo,* capital of the kingdom of Bungo, in the company of Father Master Francisco Xavier, and of how the king behaved toward Fucarandono and the other bonzes, who had seen fit to enter into theological disputations with the saintly priest regarding the superiority of our holy religion. I will now speak of a doctrine as curious as it is salutary to the spirit, and worthy of being revealed to all the republics of Christendom.",CO113CL10
18542,4,"One day, while out taking a stroll with Diogo Meireles, in that same city of Fucheo in the year of our Lord 1552, we happened upon a crowd of people gathered at a street corner. They were standing around a local man who was holding forth, gesturing and shouting.",CO113CL10
18543,5,"The crowd numbered, at the lowest estimate, more than a hundred people, all of them men, and all with mouths agape. Diogo Meireles, who knew the local language better than I, for he had previously spent many months there in the company of a band of merchant-adventurers (he was now engaged in the practice of medicine, which he had studied to useful advantage and in which he now excelled), repeated for me in our language what the speaker was saying, which was, in short, as follows: that he desired only to proclaim the true origin of crickets, which were born out of thin air and the leaves of coconut palms during the conjunction of the new moon. He went on to add that this discovery, impossible to anyone who was not, like him, a mathematician, physician, and philosopher, was the fruit of long years of application, experiment, study, hard work, and even danger to life and limb. All of this he had done for the praise and glory of the kingdom of Bungo, and, in particular, the city of Fucheo, of which he was a loyal son, and if he must pay with his life for postulating such a sublime truth, then so be it, so sure was he that science was a far richer prize than the pleasures of life itself.",CO113CL10
18544,6,"As soon as he had finished, the crowd almost deafened us with their tumultuous cries of acclamation, and hoisted the man aloft onto their shoulders, shouting: “Patimau! Patimau! Long live Patimau, who has discovered the true origin of crickets!” And they carried him off to the porch outside a merchant’s emporium, where they gave him refreshments and bowed ceremoniously according to the customs of this country, which are obsequious and courtly in the extreme.",CO113CL10
18545,7,"Diogo Meireles and I turned back the way we had come, discussing this singular discovery about the origin of crickets, when, only a short walk from the merchant’s emporium, no longer than it would take to say the creed six times, we came upon another crowd of people, on another street corner, listening to another man. We were taken aback by the similarity of the situation, and, as this other man also spoke very quickly, Diogo Meireles once again translated the tenor of his speech for me.",CO113CL10
18546,8,"The man was saying, to great admiration and applause from the people surrounding him, that he had at last discovered the font of the future life that would surely follow upon the Earth’s utter destruction, and that this was neither more nor less than a single drop of cow’s blood; this was why the cow proved such an excellent habitation for the human soul, and explained the fervor with which so many men, at the hour of their death, sought out this remarkable animal. It was a discovery in which he had complete faith and confidence, resulting as it did from his own repeated experiments and deep cogitations, for which he neither sought nor desired any reward greater than that of glorifying the kingdom of Bungo and receiving from it the esteem due to all loyal sons.",CO113CL10
18547,9,"The people, who had listened to this speech with great veneration, greeted it with the same hullabaloo as before, and took the man to the aforementioned merchant’s emporium, with the difference that this time they carried him on a palanquin. Upon arriving there, he was showered with the same favors and attentions as had been shown to Patimau, with no distinction being made between them, and their grateful hosts were unsparing in the generous thanks they gave to their two honored guests.",CO113CL10
18548,10,"We could make neither head nor tail of any of this, for the exact similarity between the two encounters seemed to us scarcely accidental, nor did we find Patimau’s theory of the origin of crickets any more rational or credible than the font of future life discovered by Languru, which was the other man’s name. However, we happened to be passing the house of a certain sandal-maker called Titané, who rushed out to speak to Diogo Meireles, with whom he was acquainted.",CO113CL10
18549,11,"After exchanging greetings, in which the sandal-maker addressed Diogo Meireles as “golden truth and sun of thought” and other such gallant names, the latter told the former what we had just seen and heard, to which Titané replied with great enthusiasm: “It may well be that they are followers of a new doctrine, said to be invented by a very wise bonze who dwells in one of the houses on the slopes of Mount Coral.”",CO113CL10
18550,12,"And because we were eager to hear more about this doctrine, Titané agreed to go with us the following day to visit the bonze, adding: “They say he will only confide his doctrine to those who truly desire to adhere to it; if that is true, we can pretend that we have come with the sole purpose of hearing his doctrine, and then, if we like it, we may do with it as we see fit.”",CO113CL10
18551,13,"The following day, as agreed, we went to the abode of the aforementioned bonze, who went by the curious name of Pomada, which in our language means “charlatan.” He was an old man of a hundred and eight, well read in letters both divine and human, and widely revered by the pagan masses; for this very reason he was distrusted by the other bonzes, who were consumed with jealousy. And so, having learned from Titané who we were and what we wanted, the aforementioned bonze first of all initiated us into the various rituals and ceremonies necessary for the reception of his doctrine, and only then did he raise his voice to reveal and explain it to us.",CO113CL10
18552,14,"“You must understand,” he began, “that virtue and knowledge have two parallel existences, one in the man who possesses them, and the other in the minds of those who hear or observe him. If you were to put the most sublime virtues and the most profound knowledge into a solitary individual, removed from all contact with other men, it would be as if such things did not exist.",CO113CL10
18553,15,"If no one tastes the fruits of an orange tree, it is worth no more than wild gorse and scrub, and if nobody sees such fruits, they are worth nothing at all. Or, to put it more succinctly, there is no spectacle without a spectator. One day, while pondering such matters, I realized that achieving this small crumb of self-enlightenment had entirely consumed my life, and, moreover, it would all be in vain without the presence of other men to witness and honor me; I then wondered whether there might be some means of achieving the same effect with less effort, and that day, I can tell you now, was the day of mankind’s rebirth, for it gave me my new doctrine.”",CO113CL10
18554,16,"At this point, we pricked up our ears and hung upon the lips of the bonze, who, since Diogo had told him I was unfamiliar with the local language, was speaking very slowly so that I would miss nothing. And on he went: “You will never guess what gave me the idea of this new doctrine: it was neither more nor less than the moonstone, that famous stone so luminous that, when placed on a mountaintop or on the pinnacle of a tower, it gives light to the whole countryside around, no matter how extensive.",CO113CL10
18555,17,"Such a stone, so rich in light, has never existed and no one has ever seen it, but many people believe it exists and more than one will tell you that he has seen it with his own eyes. I considered the matter and realized that if a thing can exist in someone’s opinion without existing in reality, or exist in reality without existing in someone’s opinion, the conclusion must be that of the two parallel existences, the only one necessary is that of opinion, not of reality, which is merely an additional convenience.",CO113CL10
18556,18,"No sooner had I made this discovery, however speculative, than I gave thanks to God for bestowing on me such special favor, and I resolved to verify it by experimentation. This I achieved on more than one occasion, but I will not bore you by going into the details. In order to understand the efficacy of my system, it is enough to tell you that crickets cannot be born out of thin air and the leaves of the coconut tree during the conjunction of the new moon, and the font of future life does not lie in a single drop of cow’s blood; and yet Patimau and Languru, who are both clever men, were able to plant both these ideas into the minds of the masses so artfully that they now enjoy reputations as great physicians and even greater philosophers, and have followers who would willingly give their lives for them.”",CO113CL10
18557,19,"We did not know how best to express to the bonze our intense appreciation and admiration. He continued to question us, in detail, for quite some time about his doctrine and its founding principles, and once he was satisfied that we had fully understood it, he encouraged us to put it into practice, revealing it very cautiously, not because it contained anything that was contrary to divine or human laws, but because a misunderstanding could cause the doctrine irreparable damage before it had even taken its first steps. Finally, he bade us farewell in the certainty (and these were his very words) that we were “departing with your souls transformed into those of true Pomadists,” a term which pleased him enormously, based as it was on his own name.",CO113CL10
18558,20,"Indeed, before evening fell, the three of us had agreed to set to work on an idea that would prove as lucrative as it was judicious, for profit cannot be measured only in money, but according to the respect and praise one receives, for both are an alternative and perhaps better currency, even if they are of no use when buying silk damasks and gold plate.",CO113CL10
18559,21,"So we agreed, by way of an experiment, that each of us would plant a certain belief in the minds of the people of Fucheo, as a result of which we would reap the same reward as Patimau and Languru. But man does not easily lose sight of his own best interests, and so Titané took it upon himself to earn twice the profit by charging for the experiment with both currencies, that is by selling sandals and, at the same time, earning men’s esteem; we did not object to this, since it seemed to us to have no bearing on the essential teachings of our doctrine.",CO113CL10
18560,22,"I’m not quite sure how best to explain Titané’s experiment in order for you to understand. Here in the kingdom of Bungo, as in other realms of these distant parts, they use a paper made from ground cinnamon bark and glue, a paper of the finest quality, which they then cut into pieces two palms long and half a palm wide. On these sheets, in a variety of bright colors and using the symbols of their own language, they inscribe the weekly news—items of a political, religious, or mercantile nature, about the new laws of the kingdom, and the names of all the fustas, lancharas, balões, and other types of vessels that ply these seas, either in warfare, which is frequent, or in trade.",CO113CL10
18561,23,"And I say weekly because these sheets of news are indeed prepared once a week, in great quantities, and distributed to the local populace for a small token, which everyone gives willingly so that they can read the news before anyone else hears about it. Now, our Titané could have wished for no better street corner than this paper, whose title translates into our language as The Life and Clarity of Mundane and Celestial Things, which is certainly expressive, if somewhat overblown.",CO113CL10
18562,24,"And so he arranged for it to be reported in the aforesaid paper that the news coming in from the coasts of Malabar and China was full of nothing but talk of Titané’s famous sandals: that they were being acclaimed as the best in the world, on account of their robustness and elegance; that, given the splendor of Titané’s famous sandals, the finest in the universe, no fewer than twenty-four mandarins were going to ask the Great Emperor to create the honorific title of “Sandal of State” as a reward to those who had distinguished themselves in any field of learning; that very large orders were flooding in from every region, orders that Titané was determined to fulfill less for love of profit than for the glory it would bring to his beloved homeland; that, nevertheless, he would not resile from his humble intention, which he had already declared to the king and hereby repeated, to donate fifty score such sandals to the kingdom’s poor; and, finally, that, despite being acknowledged as the finest sandal-maker anywhere in the world, he knew the obligations of moderation, and would never consider himself anything more than a diligent artisan working tirelessly for the glory of the kingdom of Bungo.",CO113CL10
18563,25,"The whole city of Fucheo was naturally deeply moved upon reading this news, and spoke of nothing else for the whole of that week. Titané’s sandals, until then considered merely adequate, began to be sought out with great curiosity and enthusiasm, and even more so in the weeks that followed, since he continued for some time to entertain the city with many extraordinary tales about his merchandise. And he said to us, very cheerily:",CO113CL10
18564,26,"“You can see that I have obeyed the fundamental principles of our doctrine, for I have made the people believe in the superiority of these sandals even though I am not persuaded of it myself, indeed I find them rather ordinary; and now everyone rushes to buy them, for whatever price I choose to charge.”",CO113CL10
18565,27,"“It doesn’t seem to me,” I interrupted, “that you have followed the doctrine in all its rigor and substance, for it is not our task to instill in others an opinion that we do not ourselves hold, but rather to convince them of a quality in us that we do not actually possess; that surely is the essence of the doctrine.”",CO113CL10
18566,28,"The other two then agreed that it was now my turn to attempt the experiment, and I did so immediately. I will not, however, relate every aspect of my own experiment, so as not to delay my account of Diogo Meireles’s experiment, which was the most decisive of the three and provided the best proof of the bonze’s delightful invention. I will say only that, having a smattering of music and a mediocre talent on the flute, I had the idea of gathering the leading citizens of Fucheo to hear me play the instrument. They duly came, listened, and went away saying that they had never heard anything quite so extraordinary.",CO113CL10
18567,29,"I confess that I achieved this result solely by virtue of airs and affectations: the elegant arch of my arms when I played the flute, which was brought to me on a silver salver, the firmness of my chest, the unctuous devotion with which I raised my eyes to heaven, and the contemptuous disdain with which I looked down at the audience, which promptly burst into such a concert of voices and cries of enthusiasm that I was almost persuaded of my own merit.",CO113CL10
18568,30,"But, as I said, of all our experiments, Diego Miereles’s was the most ingenious. At the time, a most peculiar disease was spreading through the city, one that caused a patient’s nose to swell up so much that it covered half his or her face. This not only made them look utterly hideous, it also proved a very heavy burden to carry around. Although the local physicians proposed removing the swollen noses, for the relief and cure of those afflicted, no one would consent to succumb to such treatment, preferring excess to absence, and holding that the lack of that organ would be more bothersome than any other outcome.",CO113CL10
18569,31,"In such a predicament, several resorted to voluntary death as a remedy, to the great sadness of the whole city. Diogo Meireles, who, as mentioned earlier, had been practicing medicine for some time, studied the illness and agreed that there was no danger in relieving the sufferers of their noses; indeed it would be beneficial to remove the problem, and cause no further ugliness, since a heavy, misshapen nose was just as bad as none at all. He did not, however, manage to persuade the unfortunate sufferers to make the necessary sacrifice.",CO113CL10
18570,32,"Then a cunning plan occurred to him. And so it was that, having gathered together many physicians, philosophers, bonzes, representatives of authority and the people, he informed them that he held the secret to solving the problem. This secret was nothing less than replacing the diseased nose with one that was healthy, but of a purely metaphysical nature—that is, imperceptible to the human eye, but just as, or even more, real than the one that had been removed. It was a cure he had performed in many different places, and one that was widely accepted by the physicians of Malabar.",CO113CL10
18571,33,"The crowd was greatly astonished, and some were quite incredulous; I don’t say all of them, for the majority did not know what to believe, repelled as they were by the metaphysics of noses. Gradually, however, they succumbed to the force of Diogo Meireles’s words and the convincing tone with which he expounded his remedy. It was then that several philosophers, ashamed to appear any less knowledgeable than Diogo Meireles, declared that there was indeed a sound basis for such a discovery, given that mankind itself was nothing more than the product of transcendental ideals, from which they concluded that one could, in all likelihood, wear a metaphysical nose, and thus solemnly assured the crowd that it would be just as effective.",CO113CL10
18572,34,"The assembled throng cheered Diogo Meireles to the rafters, and patients began to come to him in such numbers that he could scarcely keep up. Diogo Meireles relieved them of their noses with the greatest of skill, his fingers then reaching delicately toward a box in which he pretended to keep the substitute noses, picking up one and applying it to the empty space.",CO113CL10
18573,35,"The patients, thus cured and made whole again, looked at each other and could see nothing where the removed organ had been; however, convinced that the substitute organ was indeed there, albeit imperceptible to the human eye, they did not consider themselves cheated, and returned to their daily occupations. I could wish for no better proof of the efficacy of the doctrine, and the success of this experiment, than the fact that all those who were relieved of their noses by Diogo Meireles continued to make use of their handkerchiefs just as before. All of which I have set down here to the glory of the bonze and for the benefit of the world.",CO113CL10

18575,2,"Like other social institutions, slavery brought with it a number of activities and artifacts. Let me mention a few artifacts associated with a particular activity of interest to our story. A sort of iron collar is one; an iron chain attached to the ankle, another; and, third, a metallic mask. The mask eliminated the vice of drunkenness among slaves by covering their mouths. It had only three openings—two for the eyes and one to breathe through—and it was fastened with a lock behind the head.",CO210CL06
18576,3,"Without the vice of drunkenness, slaves lost the temptation to steal, because it was commonly a coin or two belonging to the master that they used to buy a drink. So the mask eliminated not one vice, but two, and guaranteed both sobriety and honesty. The mask was grotesque, admittedly, but social order is not always achieved without grotesquery and, sometimes, cruelty. Tinsmiths hung these masks for sale by the doors of their shops. But let’s not worry about masks.",CO210CL06
18577,4,"The iron collar was locked around the neck of slaves who had attempted to escape, following their recapture. Imagine a thick iron ring and, on it, to the left or the right of the wearer’s neck, a thick iron bar extending up to the height of the wearer’s head. It was heavy, of course, but it was less a punishment than a marker. Any slave who ran away again wearing such a collar would be noticed wherever he went and quickly recaptured.",CO210CL06
18578,5,"Half a century ago, slaves ran away frequently. There were a lot of slaves, back then, and not all of them liked slavery. They were occasionally beaten, and not all of them liked to be beaten. Many were merely scolded, of course, because someone in the household defended them or because their owners were not mean or simply did not want to damage their property. Money, apparently, can feel pain, too.",CO210CL06
18579,6,"Still, slaves kept running away. Sometimes—although this was rare—a recently imported slave would sprint away from the Valongo slave market through the streets of Rio de Janeiro without any idea of where he was going. Newly imported slaves who were purchased and taken home soon learned their way around the streets and acquired the rudiments of Portuguese. Then they would ask the master to let them go out daily and earn money for him as street vendors or slaves for hire, and these had many opportunities to run away.",CO210CL06
18580,7,"The owner of a runaway slave offered a monetary reward to whoever brought him back. He put an advertisement in the newspaper with a description of the runaway—name, clothing, any noticeable physical defect, the neighborhood where the slave was last seen, and the amount offered in bounty. When the ad mentioned no specific amount, it promised “a generous reward.” Such ads often contained a small illustration of a barefoot black man running, a sack with his few belongings slung over his shoulder on a stick. They invoked the full rigor of the law against anyone who aided or abetted the escape.",CO210CL06
18581,8,"Now, catching escaped slaves was then a common occupation, useful, if not exactly noble, and, because it enforced the law and the sanctity of property, it had a secondhand sort of respectability. No one studied slave catching or took it up merely as a pastime, however. Poverty, a chance occurrence, the desire to serve, a lack of aptitude for other sorts of work, but most often the simple need to make ends meet—such were the motivations of the valiant men who imposed order on disorder in midcentury Rio de Janeiro.",CO210CL06
18582,9,"Cándido Neves—Candy, to friends and family—the person about whom this story of a slave catcher is being told, was motivated by poverty, pure and simple. He couldn’t tolerate any sort of trade or employment. He was “jinxed,” he said. His first idea was to learn typesetting, but he quickly saw that it would take time to master and, even then, he told himself, might not pay enough.",CO210CL06
18583,10,"He liked the idea of business, which was an excellent career, and so became cashier at a small store. In practice, though, serving customers at the counter annoyed him and wounded his pride, so he quit after five or six weeks. Letter carrier, notary’s assistant, messenger for an imperial ministry, and other jobs—were jettisoned soon after he got them.",CO210CL06
18584,11,"When he fell in love with Clara, he had only debts to his name—not too many, though, because he lived with his cousin, a wood-carver by trade. After various failed attempts to find other work, he decided to enter his cousin’s trade, of which he already knew some elements.",CO210CL06
18585,12,"He easily learned more, but he was in a hurry and didn’t learn them very well. So he stayed away from anything delicate or complicated, doing only claw-feet for sofas and simple carving for the backs of chairs. He wanted to be employed when he got married, and that didn’t take long to happen.",CO210CL06
18586,13,"He was thirty years old, Clara twenty-two. She was an orphan and lived with her Aunt Monica, in whose house she did needlework. She wasn’t so busy sewing that she couldn’t have boyfriends, but the boyfriends were only interested in killing time with her, so it appeared, and nothing else. They spent afternoons in the sitting room, gazing at her, and she at them, until the evening, when she had to go sew.",CO210CL06
18587,14,"She noticed that she didn’t really like them and didn’t miss them in their absence. She possibly never learned the names of many. She did want to get married, naturally. Her aunt said that it was like fishing: you just waited, cane pole in hand, to see if anything took the bait. But nothing did. Most fish swam by without stopping, and the few that stopped merely poked at the bait without taking it before swimming away in search of something better.",CO210CL06
18588,15,"Love brings us various missives. One has to open the envelopes to see what is inside. When Clara first saw Cándido Neves, she felt immediately that this might be her future husband, the one and only. They met at a dance. Such, one could say, recalling the attempted initial profession of the groom, was page one of their romance, a book that turned out poorly typeset and worse bound.",CO210CL06
18589,16,"The wedding took place eleven months later, with quite a celebration. Clara’s friends tried to dissuade her from the step that she was about to take. They did not deny that the groom was a fine fellow, or that he loved her, or that he possessed a number of virtues. But they said that he was too fond of partying.",CO210CL06

18616,43,"More than once he was standing on a corner conversing absentmindedly and, among many slaves passing by, recognized one as a runaway. And he knew which one—the name, the owner’s name, the owner’s address, and the amount of the reward, too. He didn’t grab the slave right away, either. He waited for the right moment and then, one jump, and the reward was in his hands. Sometimes he shed a drop of blood, the work of the other person’s teeth and fingernails, but mostly he got by without a scratch.",CO210CL06

And, anyway, you’ve got plenty of time. In a few years, when you can afford them, then you can have children, and you’ll want them as much as this one, or even more, because then you can take care of them. Someone else will raise this one, and it will be fine. Leaving it in the foundling’s wheel isn’t like leaving it on the beach or in some trash heap.

18639,66,"Our Cándido went out as well, but in a different direction. He never panicked in such situations. He would get the money somehow, no telling how, but somehow, he was sure. He took a look at the announcements of runaway slaves. There were several, including some that he had seen for weeks. But he spent a few hours looking around without results and then went home. Four days later he remained empty handed and was ready to try anything. He went to talk to various of the landlord’s friends, getting only the suggestion that he vacate the premises.",CO210CL06
18640,67,"The situation had become acute. They had found nowhere to move, no one to help them. They were going to be out in the street. They were not counting on Aunt Monica.

18646,73,"In the meantime, he reviewed all the notices concerning runaway slaves. Most did not specify the reward; others offered a negligible amount. One, however, promised a hundred milréis.

18647,74,"Cándido Neves had searched for her days earlier, without luck, and had given up looking. He had decided that, young and pretty, she must be hiding in the house of a lover. Now, however, the sizeable reward and his urgent need for money inspired Cándido Neves to make a final, supreme effort. The next morning he went out to search around Carioca Square and in the neighborhood around the churches of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of the Good Birth, where the runaway had last been seen.",CO210CL06
18648,75,"He did not find her. His only lead came from an apothecary who remembered selling an ounce of some medication, three days earlier, to a woman who matched her description.

18649,76,He went back to his sad provisional residence. Aunt Monica had made supper for the new mother and gotten the baby ready to take to the foundling’s wheel. The new father could hardly conceal his anguish.,CO210CL06
18650,77,"He refused to eat the plate of food that Aunt Monica had put aside for him. He wasn’t hungry, he said, and it was true. He racked his brain for ways to keep his son, but he could think of nothing. The poor rooms where they had taken shelter reminded him of their desperate situation. He turned to his wife, who seemed resigned. Aunt Monica had painted her a lurid picture of the fate that awaited the child if it were not given for adoption.",CO210CL06
18651,78,"Cándido Neves found himself obligated to do what he had agreed to do. He asked his wife to feed the child for the last time. She did so, the little one fell asleep, and he gathered it in his arms and went out.",CO210CL06
18652,79,"More than once he almost turned around, it’s true—and true, too, that he held his baby tenderly, kissed it, and carefully covered its face to protect it from the night air. When he reached Old Guard Street, his steps began to slow down.",CO210CL06

It was the runaway mulata.",CO210CL06
18655,82,"I will not try to describe the commotion that Cándido Neves experienced in that moment, because no description could communicate its real intensity. Let’s just say that it was enormous. She continued down the street, he turned in the same direction, and within a few steps he came upon the shop of the apothecary with whom he had spoken earlier.

18658,85,"“Arminda!” he shouted, remembering the name from the advertisement.",CO210CL06
18659,86,"Arminda turned around, suspecting nothing. It was only then, when Cándido Neves pulled a length of rope from his pocket and pounced, grabbing her by the arm, that she understood the danger and tried to flee. But it was too late. Cándido’s powerful hands bound her wrists, and he told her to get moving.",CO210CL06
18660,87,"The slave wanted to scream, and did produce a small, stifled cry, but immediately realized that it was hopeless. No one would come to her aid—rather, to the contrary, anyone who came would help her assailant, whom she now begged to release her, please, for the love of God.",CO210CL06
18661,88,"“I am pregnant, good sir!” she exclaimed. “If the gentleman has any children of his own, I implore him to remember that child and let me go. I will be his slave and serve him as long as he wishes. Please, young sir, please let me go!”",CO210CL06

People passing by, or standing in the doorways of shops, recognized what was happening and naturally didn’t interfere. Arminda was protesting that her master was cruel and would probably have her punished with a whip—a punishment that, in her condition, she couldn’t withstand. Yes, he would almost certainly have her flogged!",CO210CL06
18666,93,“It’s your own fault. Who told you to run away pregnant?” asked Cándido Neves.,CO210CL06
18667,94,"He was in no mood for foolishness, thinking of his own child, whom he had left waiting with the apothecary. He wasn’t much of a talker, anyway. He dragged the struggling slave down Goldsmith Street toward the corner of Customs House Street, where her master lived. When they got there, the struggle intensified.",CO210CL06
18668,95,"The slave put her feet against a wall and resisted turning the corner with all her might, but to no avail. All she achieved was a delay, and after more minutes than it should have taken, she arrived at the house, panting and desperate, and there she dropped to her knees, pleading one last time. Her master was at home and, hearing a knock and a scuffle, opened the large door.",CO210CL06

18674,101,"Her half-formed fetus emerged lifeless into the world, amid the groans of its mother and the exasperation of her owner. Cándido Neves took in the whole scene. What time was it?

18675,102,"When he got there, he found the apothecary alone, with no sign of the child who had been left in his care. Cándido Neves wanted to strangle the man. Fortunately, though, the apothecary explained everything. The child was with his family in his house behind the shop, and the two men went there. The father grabbed his son no less furiously than he had grabbed the runaway slave shortly before, though this was a different sort of fury, of course—the fury of love.",CO210CL06
18676,103,"He offered hurried and inadequate thanks, raced out the door, and headed not for the foundling’s wheel but for his temporary lodgings, clutching his baby and the reward money. When Aunt Monica heard the whole story, she forgave the baby’s return home along with the one hundred milréis.",CO210CL06

18680,2,"When slavery ended, it took with it certain trades and tools; the same must have happened with other social institutions. I’ll only mention some of the tools because of their link with certain trades. One of them was the neck iron, another was leg irons; there was also the tin-plate mask. The mask cured the slaves of the vice of drunkenness by shutting their mouths. It had only three holes in it, two to see, one to breathe, and it was fastened behind the head with a padlock.",CO210CL04
18681,3,"Not only did this curb the vice of drinking: the slaves also lost the temptation to steal because they generally used their master’s small change to slake their thirst, and so two sins were eliminated, and honesty and sobriety were assured. The mask was grotesque, but order in the human and social realm is not always achieved without grotesquery – cruelty, even, sometimes. Tinsmiths used to hang them up, for sale, in the doorways of their shops. But let’s not think about masks.",CO210CL04
18682,4,"The neck iron was applied to slaves with the habit of running away. Imagine a thick collar, with an equally thick shaft on one side, left or right, which went up to the top of the head, and which was locked behind with a key. It weighed a lot, naturally, but it was less a punishment than a sign. A slave who fled with one of these showed that he was a repeated offender, and wherever he went was easily caught.",CO210CL04
18683,5,"Half a century ago, slaves frequently ran away. There were lots of them, and not all of them liked being slaves. From time to time they would be beaten, and not all of them liked being beaten. Many were simply reprimanded; there was someone in the household who acted as their godfather, and the owner himself wasn’t a bad man; besides, the sensation of ownership acted as a softener, for money hurts, too.",CO210CL04
18684,6,"Escapes happened repeatedly, however. There were even cases, exceptional though they were, when a contraband slave, no sooner had he been bought in the Valongo, took to his heels, even though he was unfamiliar with the city streets. Some of those who went into private houses, as soon as they were used to their surroundings, asked their masters to fix a rent, and went to earn it outside, selling items in the street.",CO210CL04
18685,7,"When someone’s slave escaped, they offered a sum of money to whoever returned them. They put advertisements in the newspapers, with the distinguishing marks of the escapee, his name, clothes, physical defects if he had any, the neighbourhood where he might be and the amount of the reward. When the amount wasn’t mentioned, there was a promise: ‘There will be a generous reward’, or: ‘You will be well rewarded’. Often the advertisement carried above it, or at the side, a little vignette of a black man, barefoot, with a stick over his shoulder and a bundle on the end. Anyone who gave the slave shelter was threatened with the full rigour of the law.",CO210CL04
18686,8,"Well then, catching runaway slaves was one of the trades of the time. Maybe it wasn’t a noble one, but since it was the forcible instrument whereby law and property were safeguarded, it had that other implicit kind of nobility we owe to the law and its demands. No one entered the trade out of a desire for entertainment, nor did it require much study; poverty, a sudden need for money, unsuitability for other jobs, chance, and sometimes a pleasure in serving too, though in another walk of life, provided the incentive to anyone who felt strong enough to impose order on disorder.",CO210CL04
18687,9,"Candido Neves – Candinho to his family – is the person linked to the story of an escape; he gave in to poverty when he took up the trade of catching runaways. This man had a grave defect – he never lasted in any job or trade, and lacked the necessary stability; that’s what he called a run of bad luck. He began by wanting to learn typesetting, but soon saw it would take some time to learn the job well, and even then perhaps he might not earn enough; that was what he said to himself.",CO210CL04
18688,10,"The retail trade attracted him – a fine career was to be had there. However, the obligation of attending to everyone and serving them touched a raw nerve of pride in him, and after five or six weeks he was back in the street of his own free will. An assistant in a notary’s office, office boy in a government department attached to the ministry of the interior, postman and other jobs were abandoned soon after they were obtained.",CO210CL04

18719,41,"Candido Neves had lost his job as a wood carver, just as he’d given up on many others better or worse than that one. Catching slaves had novel charms for him. He didn’t have to sit down for hours at a stretch. All it needed was strength, a sharp eye, patience, courage and a bit of rope.",CO210CL04
18720,42,"Candido Neves read the advertisements, copied them out, put them in his pocket and went out to do his research. He had a good memory. When he’d memorised the distinguishing marks and the habits of a runaway, in no time he found him, caught, bound and returned him. A lot of strength was needed, and agility.",CO210CL04
18721,43,"More than once, on the street corner, talking of something else altogether, he saw a slave pass by like any other, realised he’d escaped, who he was, his name, who his owner was, where he lived and what the reward was; he interrupted the conversation and went after the criminal. He didn’t catch him straight away, but waited to find a suitable spot, then one leap, and the reward was his. He didn’t always get away without losing some blood, as the victim’s nails and teeth did their work, but usually he subdued them without the least scratch.",CO210CL04
18722,44,"One day these profits began to dwindle. Runaway slaves no longer gave themselves up to Candido Neves as they had been doing. There were other, skilled hands at work. As the business was growing, more than one unemployed man got his act together, grabbed a rope, looked at the papers, copied advertisements and set out on the hunt.",CO210CL04
18723,45,"Even in the neighbourhood there was more than one rival. This meant that Candido Neves’s debts started to mount, with less of those timely or near-timely payments than in the early days.

18725,47,"Sometimes, though not often, he even got the wrong person, and grabbed a faithful slave going about his master’s business. Once, he caught a freedman; he was full of apologies, but he got a healthy drubbing from the man’s family.",CO210CL04

18727,49,"Candido truly did want to do something else, not because of this advice, but because he felt like a change of job; it would be a way of changing skin or identity. The trouble is that he couldn’t find any job to hand that he could learn in a hurry.",CO210CL04

If some money doesn’t turn up, how can your family grow? There’ll be time later; later, when you’ve got a surer way of earning your living, the children that come will be received with the same affection as this one, or more. This one will be well brought up; it’ll lack for nothing. Is the Wheel some beach, or a rubbish dump?

18744,66,"Candinho went off in another direction. When he was in a fix like this he never despaired; he always counted on some loan or other, how or where from he had no idea, but from somewhere. Then he cast his eye over the advertisements. He found several, some already old, but he’d been looking in vain for a long time. He spent some hours to no effect, and went back home. Four days later, he’d still found no way out; he tried to find backing, and went to see people friendly with the owner, but was only told to pack his bags.",CO210CL04
18745,67,"It was a tight situation. They couldn’t find a house, or anyone to give them temporary lodging; it was the street or nothing. They couldn’t count on the aunt.

18747,69,"She listened to Clara’s complaints, without echoing them, it’s true – but she brought no comfort. The day they were forced to leave the house, she’d surprise them with news of the favour and they’d go and sleep better than they’d expected.",CO210CL04
18748,70,"That was what happened. Thrown out of the house, they went to the rooms they had been lent, and two days later the child was born. The father was very happy, and unhappy at the same time. Aunt Monica insisted on giving the child to the Wheel.",CO210CL04

18751,73,"That evening, he went through all his notes of runaway slaves. The rewards for the most part were just promises; some mentioned a sum, though nothing much. One, however, was for a hundred mil-reis. It was for a mulatta; there was information about her looks and her clothes.",CO210CL04
18752,74,"Candido Neves had searched for her without success, and had given up on it; he imagined some lover had taken her in. Now, however, looking again at the amount and the need he had for it gave Candido Neves the energy to make one last big effort. He went out in the morning to look for signs and ask questions round the Rua da Carioca and the nearby square, the Rua do Parto and the Rua da Ajuda, which was where she might be, according to the advertisement.",CO210CL04
18753,75,"He didn’t find her; only a chemist in the Rua da Ajuda remembered selling an ounce of some drug, three days before, to someone with those marks. Candido Neves talked as if he were the slave’s owner, and politely thanked him for the information. He had no better luck with other runaways whose reward was meagre, or less certain.",CO210CL04
18754,76,"He went back to the miserable lodgings they’d been lent. Aunt Monica had put some food together for the young mother, and had the child ready to be taken to the Wheel. The father, in spite of the agreement they’d reached, could hardly hide his pain at what he saw.",CO210CL04
18755,77,"He refused to eat what Aunt Monica had kept for him; he wasn’t hungry, he said, and it was true. He thought of a thousand ways whereby he could keep his son; but none was any good. He couldn’t even forget the shelter where he was living. He consulted his wife, who seemed resigned. Aunt Monica had described the child’s future upbringing: more and greater poverty – perhaps he would die in utter destitution.",CO210CL04
18756,78,"Candido Neves was forced to fulfil his promise; he asked his wife to give their son the last milk he would drink from his mother. This done, the child went to sleep; his father picked him up, and went off in the direction of the Rua dos Barbonos.",CO210CL04
18757,79,"We can be sure he thought more than once of going back home with him; and that he wrapped him up warm, kissed him, and covered his face to keep the damp night air off. When he entered the Rua da Guarda Velha, Candido Neves began to slacken his pace.",CO210CL04
18758,80,"‘I’ll give him up as late as I can,’ he murmured.",CO210CL04
18759,81,"But since the street was not infinite, or even long, eventually he’d come to its end; it was then that it occurred to him to go into one of the alleyways that linked it to the Rua da Ajuda, and he saw the figure of a woman on the other side of the street: it was the mulatta who had escaped.",CO210CL04
18760,82,"I won’t depict Candido Neves’s commotion here, because I can’t convey it with enough intensity. One adjective is enough; let’s say it was enormous. As the woman went down the street, he went too; a few steps away was the pharmacy where he’d got the information, as I’ve already recounted. He went in, found the pharmacist, asked him if he’d be so kind as to look after the child for a moment; he’d be back to get it, without fail.",CO210CL04
18761,83,‘But …’,CO210CL04
18762,84,"Candido Neves gave him no time to say anything; he hurried out, crossed the street, up to the point where he could catch the woman without creating a disturbance. At the end of the street, when she was turning to go down the Rua de São José, Candido Neves came close to her. It was her, it was the runaway mulatta.",CO210CL04

18764,86,"Arminda turned round without suspecting ill intent. It was only when he’d pulled the piece of rope from his pocket and grabbed her arms that she realised and tried to flee. It was too late. Candido Neves, with his strong hands, tied her wrists and told her to get moving.",CO210CL04
18765,87,"The slave made as if to shout; it seems she even let out a louder cry than usual, but she soon realised that no one would come to free her – quite the contrary. She then asked him to free her, for the love of God.",CO210CL04

Passers-by, or people in shop doorways understood what was going on, and naturally didn’t get involved. Arminda alleged that her master was a very bad man, and would probably punish her with a whipping – which, in the state she was in, would hurt much more. No doubt of it, he’d have her whipped.",CO210CL04
18771,93,‘It’s your own fault. Who asked you to have a child and then flee?’ asked Candido Neves.,CO210CL04
18772,94,"He wasn’t in the best frame of mind, because of the child he’d left behind in the pharmacy, waiting for him. It’s also true that he wasn’t one for saying anything very profound. He dragged the slave along the Rua dos Ourives, towards the Rua da Alfândega, where her master lived.",CO210CL04
18773,95,"On the corner of this last street, the struggle got worse; the slave planted her feet against the wall, and pulled back with great effort, to no avail. All she did was make it take more time to get to the house than it would have done, and it was nearby. Finally, she arrived, dragged along, desperate, gasping for breath. She even got down on her knees, but in vain. The master was at home, and responded to the call and the commotion.",CO210CL04

18780,102,"When he got there, he saw that the chemist was alone, without the child he’d handed over. He felt like strangling him. Fortunately, the chemist explained everything in time; the child was inside with his family, and both went inside. The father grabbed his son with the same degree of ferocity he’d used to grab the slave-woman a short while back, a different ferocity, of course – the ferocity of love.",CO210CL04

18785,2,"LIKE MANY OTHER social institutions, slavery brought with it certain trades and implements. I will mention only a few of those implements because of their connection with a particular trade. There was the neck iron, the leg iron, and the iron muzzle. The muzzle covered the mouth as a way of putting a stop to the vice of drunkenness among slaves. It had only three holes, two to see through and one to breathe through, and was fastened at the back of the head with a padlock.",CO210CL12
18786,3,"Along with the vice of drunkenness, the muzzle also did away with the temptation to steal, because slaves tended to steal their master’s money in order to slake their thirst, and thus two grave sins were abolished, and sobriety and honesty saved. The muzzle was a grotesque thing, but then human and social order cannot always be achieved without the grotesque or, indeed, without occasional acts of cruelty. The tinsmiths would hang them up at the doors of their shops. But that’s enough of muzzles for the moment.",CO210CL12
18787,4,"The neck iron was fitted to slaves who made repeated attempts to escape. Imagine a very thick collar, with a thick rod either to the right or the left that extended as far as the head and was locked from behind with a key. It was, of course, heavy, but was intended not so much as a punishment as a sign. Any slave who ran away wearing one of these would instantly be identified as a repeat offender and quickly recaptured.",CO210CL12
18788,5,"Half a century ago, slaves often ran away. There were large numbers of them, and not all enjoyed enslavement. They would sometimes be beaten, and not all of them liked being beaten. Many would merely receive a reprimand, either because someone in the household would speak up for them or because the owner wasn’t necessarily a bad man; besides, a sense of ownership moderates any punishment, and losing money is not itself without pain.",CO210CL12
18789,6,"There were always runaways, though. In a few rare cases, a contraband slave who had just been bought in the Valongo slave market would immediately escape and race off down the streets, even though he didn’t know the town at all. Those who stayed put—usually the ones who already spoke Portuguese—would arrange to pay a nominal “rent” to their master and then earn their living outside the house as street vendors.",CO210CL12
18790,7,"A reward was offered to anyone who returned a runaway slave. Advertisements were placed in the local newspapers, with a description of the fugitive, his name, what he was wearing, any physical defects, the area where he had last been seen, and the amount of the reward. When no amount was given, there would be a promise: “will be handsomely rewarded” or “will receive a generous reward.” The advertisement would often be accompanied at the top or the side by a drawing of a black figure, barefoot and running, with, on his shoulder, a stick with a small bundle attached. It also carried a warning that anyone sheltering the runaway would feel the full force of the law.",CO210CL12
18791,8,"Now, pursuing fugitive slaves was one of the trades of the time. It might not have been a very noble profession, but, since it involved helping the forces who defend the law and private property, it had a different sort of nobility, the kind implicit in retrieving what is lost. No one took up that trade in the pursuit of entertainment or education; other reasons lay behind such a choice for any man who felt tough enough to impose order on disorder: poverty, a need for money, a lack of any other skills, pure chance, and, occasionally, the desire to be useful, at least to one of the parties.",CO210CL12
18792,9,"Cândido Neves—known to his family as Candinho—is the person caught up in this tale of an escaped slave; he had already sunk into poverty when he began recapturing fugitive slaves. He had one grave fault: an inability to hold down any job or trade; he had no staying power, although he himself put this down to bad luck. He started out wanting to be a typographer, but soon saw that it would take a long time to become really good, and that even then he might not earn enough, or so, at least, he told himself.",CO210CL12
18793,10,"Then a career in commerce seemed a good idea, and he eventually found a job as a clerk in a notions store. However, being obliged to attend to and serve all and sundry wounded his self-esteem, and, after five or six weeks, he left of his own volition.

More out of envy than out of friendship, Clara’s friends tried to dissuade her from the path she was about to take.

18823,40,"He was proud of this, and spoke of hope as if it were money in the bank. Then he laughed and made the aunt laugh, too, for she was, by nature, a cheerful soul and was already looking forward to another party when the child was baptized.",CO210CL12
18824,41,"Cândido Neves had abandoned his job as a wood-carver, as he had so many others before, both better and worse. Catching runaway slaves had a certain charm. He was not obliged to spend long hours sitting down, and all the job required was strength, a quick eye, patience, courage, and a length of rope.",CO210CL12
18825,42,"He would read the advertisements, copy them down, stick the piece of paper in his pocket, and set off in search of fugitives. He had a keen memory too. Once he had fixed in his mind the features and habits of a slave, it did not take long to find him, secure him, tie him up, and bring him back. Strength and agility were what counted.",CO210CL12
18826,43,"On more than one occasion, he would be standing on a corner, chatting, and along would come a slave, looking no different from any other slave, and yet Cândido would recognize him at once as a runaway, his name, his master, his master’s house, and the size of the reward; he would immediately interrupt the conversation and set off after the villain. He wouldn’t stop him there and then, but would wait for the right place to nab both slave and reward. Occasionally the slave would fight tooth and nail, but, generally speaking, Candinho emerged from such encounters without a scratch.",CO210CL12
18827,44,"One day, though, his earnings began to dwindle. Runaway slaves no longer surrendered themselves only to Cândido Neves’s hands. There were newer, more skillful hands around. As the business grew, other unemployed men took themselves and a length of rope and went off to the newspapers to copy out the advertisements and go hunting.",CO210CL12
18828,45,"Even in his own neighborhood, he had more than one competitor. In short, Cândido’s debts began to grow, and, without the instant or almost instant reward he had garnered before, life became much harder. They ate poorly and on credit; they ate late. The landlord would send around for the rent.",CO210CL12
18829,46,"Clara was so busy sewing for other people that she barely had time to mend her husband’s clothes. Aunt Mônica helped her niece, of course, and when Cândido arrived home in the evening, she could tell from his face that he had earned nothing. He would have supper, then go straight out again, on the trail of some fugitive or other.",CO210CL12
18830,47,"On a few rare occasions, a blindness brought on by necessity caused him to pick the wrong man and pounce on a loyal slave going about his master’s business. Once, he captured a free black man, and although he apologized profusely, he was soundly beaten by the man’s relatives.",CO210CL12
18831,48,"“That’s all you need!” cried Aunt Mônica when she saw him and after he had told them about his mistake and its consequences. “Give it up, Candinho, find another way of earning a living, another job.”",CO210CL12
18832,49,"Candinho would have much preferred to do something else, although not for the same reasons, but simply for the sake of variety; it would be a way of changing skins or personality. Alas, he could find no job that could be learned quickly.",CO210CL12
18833,50,"Nature continued to take its course, the fetus was growing and was soon a weight in its mother’s belly. The eighth month came, a month of anxieties and privations, then the ninth, but I won’t go into that. It would be best simply to describe its effects, which could not have been crueler.",CO210CL12
18834,51,"“No, Aunt Mônica!” roared Candinho, rejecting a piece of advice I find painful even to write down, although not as painful as it was for Candinho to hear. “Never!”",CO210CL12
18835,52,"It was in the last week of the final month when Aunt Mônica advised the couple that, as soon as the baby was born, they should take it to the foundling wheel at the convent on Rua dos Barbonos, where they took in abandoned babies. Abandoned. There could have been no crueler word for those two young parents expecting their first child, looking forward to kissing and caring for it, watching it laugh and grow and prosper and play . . .",CO210CL12
18836,53,"In what sense would that child be abandoned? Candinho stared wild-eyed at the aunt and ended up thumping the table hard with his fist, so hard that the rickety old table almost collapsed. Clara intervened.",CO210CL12
18837,54,"“Auntie doesn’t mean any harm, Candinho.”",CO210CL12
18838,55,"“Of course I don’t,” retorted Aunt Mônica. “I’m just saying what I think would be best for you. You owe money for everything; you’ve no meat in the house, not even any beans. If you’re not bringing in a wage, how is the family to grow? After all, there’s still time. Later on, when you’ve found some steadier job, any future children will receive as much care and attention as this one, possibly more. He’ll be well cared for, he’ll lack for nothing. Giving him to the foundling hospital isn’t like abandoning him on the shore or on a dung heap. They don’t kill children there, no child dies of neglect, whereas here, living in poverty, he’s sure to die . . .”",CO210CL12
18839,56,"With a shrug, Aunt Mônica turned and went to her room. She had hinted at such a solution before, but this was the first time she had spoken with such candor and such passion, or so callously, if you like.",CO210CL12
18840,57,"Clara reached out her hand to her husband, as if to comfort him; Cândido Neves pulled a face and muttered something about her aunt being mad. This tender scene was interrupted by someone banging on the street door.",CO210CL12

18842,59,<TRANSLATION NOT INCLUDED>,CO210CL12

He had come for the unpaid rent and could wait no longer; if they didn’t pay up in the next five days, he would put them out in the street. He hadn’t worked hard all his life just to give others an easy time of it.",CO210CL12
18847,64,"To look at him, you would never think he was a landlord, but his words gave the lie to his face, and, rather than argue, poor Cândido Neves chose to say nothing. He gave a slight bow, which was both promise and plea. The landlord would not be swayed.",CO210CL12
18848,65,"“Pay me in five days, or you’re out!” he repeated, reaching for the door handle and leaving.",CO210CL12
18849,66,"Candinho also left. At such moments, he never gave in to despair. He always relied on being able to get some loan or other, even though he didn’t know how or from whom. He also went back to check the newspaper advertisements. There were several, some already old, but he had looked for all those runaways before with no success. He spent a few profitless hours, then returned home. At the end of the fourth day, he had still not managed to scrape together any money, and so he decided to try his luck with friends of the landlord, but all he received was that same order to quit the house.",CO210CL12
18850,67,"The situation was critical. They couldn’t find alternative lodgings or anyone who might take them in; they would definitely be out on the street. They had not, however, counted on Aunt Mônica. She had somehow or other found accommodation for the three of them in the house of a rich old lady, who promised to let them have the use of four rooms, behind the coach house and looking out onto a courtyard.",CO210CL12
18851,68,"Even more astutely, Aunt Mônica had said nothing to the couple, so that, in his despair, Cândido Neves would be forced to take the baby to the foundling wheel and find some steadier way of earning money; so that he would, in short, mend his ways.",CO210CL12
18852,69,"She listened patiently to Clara’s complaints, but without offering her any consolation, either. On the day they were evicted, she would surprise them with the news of this gift and they would sleep far better than expected.",CO210CL12
18853,70,"And so it was. Once evicted from their house, they went straight to the new lodgings, and, two days later, the baby was born. Cândido felt both enormously happy and enormously sad. Aunt Mônica insisted that they take the child straight to the foundling hospital on Rua dos Barbonos.",CO210CL12
18854,71,"“If you don’t want to do it, I’ll take him.”",CO210CL12
18855,72,"Cândido begged her to wait, promising that he would take him later. Yes, the baby was a boy, just as his parents had wanted. Clara quickly gave the child some milk, but then it began to rain, and Candinho said that he would take the baby to the foundling wheel the next day.",CO210CL12
18856,73,"That night, he went over all the notes he had taken about runaway slaves. Most of the rewards were mere promises; some did specify an amount, but it was always some very paltry sum. One, though, offered a hundred mil-réis. The slave in question was a mulatta; there was a description of her face and clothes.",CO210CL12
18857,74,"Cândido Neves had looked for her before, but given up, imagining that perhaps some lover had taken her in. Now, though, he felt encouraged both by the thought of that generous reward and by the desperate straits he was in. The next morning, he went out to patrol Rua da Carioca and the adjoining square, as well as Rua do Parto and Rua da Ajuda, which was the area where, according to the advertisement, she had last been seen.",CO210CL12
18858,75,"He found no trace of her, but a pharmacist on Rua da Ajuda recalled having sold an ounce of some drug three days before to a woman answering that description. Playing the part of the slave’s master, Cândido Neves politely thanked the pharmacist. He had no better luck with any of the other fugitives for whom the reward was either unspecified or low.",CO210CL12
18859,76,"He returned to their rather gloomy, temporary lodgings. Aunt Mônica had made some food for Clara, and had the baby all ready to be taken to the foundling hospital. Although Candinho had agreed to this, he could barely conceal his grief.",CO210CL12
18860,77,"He could not eat the food Aunt Mônica had kept for him; he simply wasn’t hungry, he said, and it was true. He thought of a thousand ways that would allow him to keep his son, but none of them worked. He thought about the slum in which they lived. He consulted his wife, but she seemed resigned.",CO210CL12
18861,78,"Aunt Mônica had painted a picture for her of what awaited their child—still greater poverty and with the child possibly dying as a result. Cândido Neves had no option but to keep his promise; he asked Clara to give the child the last milk he would take from his mother. Once fed, the little one fell asleep, and his father picked him up and headed off toward Rua dos Barbonos.",CO210CL12
18862,79,"More than once, he considered simply taking him back to the house; he also kept him carefully wrapped up, kissing him and covering his face to protect him from the damp night air. As he entered Rua da Guarda Velha, Cândido Neves slowed his pace.",CO210CL12
18863,80,"“I’ll delay handing him over for as long as possible,” he murmured.",CO210CL12
18864,81,"However, since the street was not infinite in length, he would soon reach the end; it was then that it occurred to him to go down one of the alleyways connecting that street to Rua da Ajuda. He reached the bottom of the alleyway and was about to turn right, in the direction of Largo da Ajuda, when, on the opposite side, he saw a woman: the runaway slave.",CO210CL12
18865,82,"I will not even attempt to describe Cândido Neves’s emotions, because I could not do so with the necessary intensity. One adjective will have to suffice; let’s say “overwhelming.” The woman walked down the street, and he followed; the pharmacy we mentioned earlier was only a few steps away. He went in, spoke to the pharmacist, and asked if he would be so kind as to look after the baby for a moment; he would return soon.",CO210CL12
18866,83,"“Yes, but—”",CO210CL12
18867,84,"Cândido Neves did not give him time to say anything more; he left at once, crossed the street, and continued on to a point where he could arrest the woman without making too much of a scene. At the end of the street, when she was about to head off down Rua de São José, Cândido Neves drew nearer. Yes, it was definitely her, the fugitive mulatta.",CO210CL12
18868,85,"“Arminda,” he called, for that was the name given in the advertisement.",CO210CL12
18869,86,"Arminda innocently turned around, and it was only when he removed the length of rope from his pocket and grabbed her arms that she realized what was happening and tried to flee. By then it was too late. With his strong hands, Cândido Neves had bound her wrists together and was ordering her to walk.",CO210CL12
18870,87,"She tried to scream, and she did perhaps call out more loudly than usual, but saw at once that no one would come to free her; on the contrary. She then begged him, for the love of God, to let her go.",CO210CL12
18871,88,"“I’m pregnant, sir!” she cried. “If you yourself have a child, I beg you for the love of that child to let me go. I’ll be your slave and serve you for as long as you like. Please, sir, let me go!”",CO210CL12

18874,91,"“Look, I don’t have time for this. Walk on!”",CO210CL12
18875,92,"There was a struggle at this point, because she, heavy with her unborn child, kept moaning and resisting. Anyone passing by or standing in a shop doorway would have realized what was going on and would, naturally, have done nothing to help. Arminda was telling him that her master was a very bad man and would probably beat her, and in her present state that would be even harder to endure. Yes, there was no doubt about it, he would have her beaten.",CO210CL12
18876,93,“It’s your own fault. Who told you to get pregnant and then run away?” Cândido Neves asked.,CO210CL12
18877,94,"He was not in the best of moods because he had his own child waiting for him at the pharmacy, and, besides, he had never been a great talker. He continued to drag her down Rua dos Ourives toward Rua da Alfândega, where her master lived.",CO210CL12
18878,95,"On the corner, she struggled still more fiercely, planting her feet against the wall and trying vainly to pull away from him. All that she achieved, though, with the house now so near, was to delay her arrival a little. They did at last arrive, she reluctant, desperate, panting. Even then, she knelt down, but again to no avail. Her master was at home and ran out to see what all the noise and shouting were about.",CO210CL12
18879,96,"“Here’s your runaway,” said Cândido Neves.",CO210CL12

18882,99,"“Come on, in you come!”",CO210CL12
18883,100,"In the hallway, Arminda stumbled and fell. And there and then her master opened his wallet and took out two fifty-mil-réis notes, which Cândido Neves immediately pocketed, while the master again ordered Arminda to come into the house. Instead, on the floor where she lay, overcome by fear and pain, she went into labor and gave birth to her now-dead child.",CO210CL12
18884,101,"That unripe fruit entered the world amid the cries and moans of the mother and the despairing gestures of the master. Cândido Neves watched the whole spectacle. He had no idea of the time, but whatever the hour, he urgently needed to go back to Rua da Ajuda, which is precisely what he did, quite indifferent to the consequences of the disaster he had just witnessed.",CO210CL12
18885,102,"When he arrived at the shop, he found the pharmacist alone, with no son to return to him. Cândido’s first instinct was to throttle the man. Fortunately, the pharmacist quickly explained that the child was inside with the family, and when both men went in, Cândido Neves furiously snatched up the baby, much as he had grabbed the runaway slave a little earlier—a very different fury, of course, the fury of love.",CO210CL12
18886,103,"He brusquely thanked the pharmacist; then, with his son in his arms and the reward in his pocket, he raced off, not to the foundling hospital, but back to their temporary lodgings. When Aunt Mônica heard his explanation, she forgave him for bringing the child back, given that he also brought with him the hundred mil-réis.",CO210CL12
18887,104,"She did have a few harsh words to say about the slave-woman, though, both for running away and for having miscarried. Kissing his son and shedding genuine tears, Cândido Neves, on the other hand, blessed the fugitive and gave barely a thought to her dead child.",CO210CL12

18890,2,"LIKE MANY OTHER social institutions, slavery brought with it certain trades and implements. I will mention only a few of those implements because of their connection with a particular trade. There was the neck iron, the leg iron, and the iron muzzle. The muzzle covered the mouth as a way of putting a stop to the vice of drunkenness among slaves. It had only three holes, two to see through and one to breathe through, and was fastened at the back of the head with a padlock.",CO210CL10
18891,3,"Along with the vice of drunkenness, the muzzle also did away with the temptation to steal, because slaves tended to steal their master’s money in order to slake their thirst, and thus two grave sins were abolished, and sobriety and honesty saved. The muzzle was a grotesque thing, but then human and social order cannot always be achieved without the grotesque or, indeed, without occasional acts of cruelty. The tinsmiths would hang them up at the doors of their shops. But that’s enough of muzzles for the moment.",CO210CL10
18892,4,"The neck iron was fitted to slaves who made repeated attempts to escape. Imagine a very thick collar, with a thick rod either to the right or the left that extended as far as the head and was locked from behind with a key. It was, of course, heavy, but was intended not so much as a punishment as a sign. Any slave who ran away wearing one of these would instantly be identified as a repeat offender and quickly recaptured.",CO210CL10
18893,5,"Half a century ago, slaves often ran away. There were large numbers of them, and not all enjoyed enslavement. They would sometimes be beaten, and not all of them liked being beaten. Many would merely receive a reprimand, either because someone in the household would speak up for them or because the owner wasn’t necessarily a bad man; besides, a sense of ownership moderates any punishment, and losing money is not itself without pain.",CO210CL10
18894,6,"There were always runaways, though. In a few rare cases, a contraband slave who had just been bought in the Valongo slave market would immediately escape and race off down the streets, even though he didn’t know the town at all. Those who stayed put—usually the ones who already spoke Portuguese—would arrange to pay a nominal “rent” to their master and then earn their living outside the house as street vendors.",CO210CL10
18895,7,"A reward was offered to anyone who returned a runaway slave. Advertisements were placed in the local newspapers, with a description of the fugitive, his name, what he was wearing, any physical defects, the area where he had last been seen, and the amount of the reward. When no amount was given, there would be a promise: “will be handsomely rewarded” or “will receive a generous reward.” The advertisement would often be accompanied at the top or the side by a drawing of a black figure, barefoot and running, with, on his shoulder, a stick with a small bundle attached. It also carried a warning that anyone sheltering the runaway would feel the full force of the law.",CO210CL10
18896,8,"Now, pursuing fugitive slaves was one of the trades of the time. It might not have been a very noble profession, but, since it involved helping the forces who defend the law and private property, it had a different sort of nobility, the kind implicit in retrieving what is lost. No one took up that trade in the pursuit of entertainment or education; other reasons lay behind such a choice for any man who felt tough enough to impose order on disorder: poverty, a need for money, a lack of any other skills, pure chance, and, occasionally, the desire to be useful, at least to one of the parties.",CO210CL10
18897,9,"Cândido Neves—known to his family as Candinho—is the person caught up in this tale of an escaped slave; he had already sunk into poverty when he began recapturing fugitive slaves. He had one grave fault: an inability to hold down any job or trade; he had no staying power, although he himself put this down to bad luck. He started out wanting to be a typographer, but soon saw that it would take a long time to become really good, and that even then he might not earn enough, or so, at least, he told himself.",CO210CL10
18898,10,"Then a career in commerce seemed a good idea, and he eventually found a job as a clerk in a notions store. However, being obliged to attend to and serve all and sundry wounded his self-esteem, and, after five or six weeks, he left of his own volition. Bookkeeper to a notary, office boy in a department attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, postman, and other positions were all abandoned shortly after he took them up.",CO210CL10
18899,11,"When he fell in love with Clara, all he had were debts, although not as yet that many, for he lived with a cousin, a wood-carver by trade. After several attempts to get work, he decided to take up his cousin’s trade, and had already had a few lessons.",CO210CL10
18900,12,"It was easy enough to get his cousin to give him a few more, but, because he wanted to learn quickly, he learned badly too.

He wanted to be working when he eventually married, and marriage was not far off.",CO210CL10
18901,13,"He was thirty years old, and Clara was twenty-two. She was an orphan and lived with her Aunt Mônica, with whom she made a living as a seamstress. Her work was not so arduous that she had no time for flirtations, but none of her potential suitors proved serious. Whole evenings passed with her looking at them and with them looking at her, until it grew dark and she had to return to her sewing.",CO210CL10
18902,14,"What she noticed was that she did not really miss any of them and none filled her with desire; she didn’t even know the names of some. She did, of course, want to marry, but, as her aunt said, it was like fishing with a rod and waiting for a fish to bite, but all the fish swam straight past, apart from the occasional one who stopped, swam around the bait, looked at it, sniffed, then swam away to inspect other bait.",CO210CL10
18903,15,"Love, however, always recognizes its intended recipient. When she saw Cândido Neves, she felt at once that he was the husband for her, the one, true husband. They met at a dance; this—to take an image from Candinho’s first job as a typographer—was the opening page of that book, one that would leave the presses badly composed and even more badly bound.",CO210CL10
18904,16,"The marriage took place eleven months later, and it was the most splendid party their relatives had ever attended. More out of envy than out of friendship, Clara’s friends tried to dissuade her from the path she was about to take.

18911,23,"All three of them enjoyed a laugh. The couple, in particular, would laugh at almost anything. Even their bright, snow-white names—Clara, Neves, Cândido—were the subject of jokes, and while jokes might not put food on the table, they did make them laugh, and laughter is easily digested.

18929,41,"Cândido Neves had abandoned his job as a wood-carver, as he had so many others before, both better and worse. Catching runaway slaves had a certain charm. He was not obliged to spend long hours sitting down, and all the job required was strength, a quick eye, patience, courage, and a length of rope.",CO210CL10
18930,42,"He would read the advertisements, copy them down, stick the piece of paper in his pocket, and set off in search of fugitives. He had a keen memory too. Once he had fixed in his mind the features and habits of a slave, it did not take long to find him, secure him, tie him up, and bring him back. Strength and agility were what counted.",CO210CL10
18931,43,"On more than one occasion, he would be standing on a corner, chatting, and along would come a slave, looking no different from any other slave, and yet Cândido would recognize him at once as a runaway, his name, his master, his master’s house, and the size of the reward; he would immediately interrupt the conversation and set off after the villain. He wouldn’t stop him there and then, but would wait for the right place to nab both slave and reward. Occasionally the slave would fight tooth and nail, but, generally speaking, Candinho emerged from such encounters without a scratch.",CO210CL10
18932,44,"One day, though, his earnings began to dwindle. Runaway slaves no longer surrendered themselves only to Cândido Neves’s hands. There were newer, more skillful hands around. As the business grew, other unemployed men took themselves and a length of rope and went off to the newspapers to copy out the advertisements and go hunting.",CO210CL10
18933,45,"Even in his own neighborhood, he had more than one competitor. In short, Cândido’s debts began to grow, and, without the instant or almost instant reward he had garnered before, life became much harder. They ate poorly and on credit; they ate late. The landlord would send around for the rent.",CO210CL10

There could have been no crueler word for those two young parents expecting their first child, looking forward to kissing and caring for it, watching it laugh and grow and prosper and play . . .",CO210CL10
18941,53,"In what sense would that child be abandoned? Candinho stared wild-eyed at the aunt and ended up thumping the table hard with his fist, so hard that the rickety old table almost collapsed. Clara intervened.",CO210CL10

If you’re not bringing in a wage, how is the family to grow? After all, there’s still time. Later on, when you’ve found some steadier job, any future children will receive as much care and attention as this one, possibly more. He’ll be well cared for, he’ll lack for nothing. Giving him to the foundling hospital isn’t like abandoning him on the shore or on a dung heap. They don’t kill children there, no child dies of neglect, whereas here, living in poverty, he’s sure to die . . .”",CO210CL10
18944,56,"With a shrug, Aunt Mônica turned and went to her room. She had hinted at such a solution before, but this was the first time she had spoken with such candor and such passion, or so callously, if you like.",CO210CL10

He hadn’t worked hard all his life just to give others an easy time of it.",CO210CL10
18952,64,"To look at him, you would never think he was a landlord, but his words gave the lie to his face, and, rather than argue, poor Cândido Neves chose to say nothing. He gave a slight bow, which was both promise and plea. The landlord would not be swayed.",CO210CL10
18953,65,"“Pay me in five days, or you’re out!” he repeated, reaching for the door handle and leaving.",CO210CL10
18954,66,"Candinho also left. At such moments, he never gave in to despair. He always relied on being able to get some loan or other, even though he didn’t know how or from whom. He also went back to check the newspaper advertisements. There were several, some already old, but he had looked for all those runaways before with no success. He spent a few profitless hours, then returned home. At the end of the fourth day, he had still not managed to scrape together any money, and so he decided to try his luck with friends of the landlord, but all he received was that same order to quit the house.",CO210CL10
18955,67,"The situation was critical. They couldn’t find alternative lodgings or anyone who might take them in; they would definitely be out on the street. They had not, however, counted on Aunt Mônica. She had somehow or other found accommodation for the three of them in the house of a rich old lady, who promised to let them have the use of four rooms, behind the coach house and looking out onto a courtyard.",CO210CL10
18956,68,"Even more astutely, Aunt Mônica had said nothing to the couple, so that, in his despair, Cândido Neves would be forced to take the baby to the foundling wheel and find some steadier way of earning money; so that he would, in short, mend his ways.",CO210CL10
18957,69,"She listened patiently to Clara’s complaints, but without offering her any consolation, either. On the day they were evicted, she would surprise them with the news of this gift and they would sleep far better than expected.",CO210CL10
18958,70,"And so it was. Once evicted from their house, they went straight to the new lodgings, and, two days later, the baby was born. Cândido felt both enormously happy and enormously sad.

18961,73,"That night, he went over all the notes he had taken about runaway slaves. Most of the rewards were mere promises; some did specify an amount, but it was always some very paltry sum. One, though, offered a hundred mil-réis. The slave in question was a mulatta; there was a description of her face and clothes.",CO210CL10
18962,74,"Cândido Neves had looked for her before, but given up, imagining that perhaps some lover had taken her in. Now, though, he felt encouraged both by the thought of that generous reward and by the desperate straits he was in. The next morning, he went out to patrol Rua da Carioca and the adjoining square, as well as Rua do Parto and Rua da Ajuda, which was the area where, according to the advertisement, she had last been seen.",CO210CL10
18963,75,"He found no trace of her, but a pharmacist on Rua da Ajuda recalled having sold an ounce of some drug three days before to a woman answering that description. Playing the part of the slave’s master, Cândido Neves politely thanked the pharmacist. He had no better luck with any of the other fugitives for whom the reward was either unspecified or low.",CO210CL10
18964,76,"He returned to their rather gloomy, temporary lodgings. Aunt Mônica had made some food for Clara, and had the baby all ready to be taken to the foundling hospital. Although Candinho had agreed to this, he could barely conceal his grief.",CO210CL10
18965,77,"He could not eat the food Aunt Mônica had kept for him; he simply wasn’t hungry, he said, and it was true. He thought of a thousand ways that would allow him to keep his son, but none of them worked. He thought about the slum in which they lived. He consulted his wife, but she seemed resigned.",CO210CL10
18966,78,"Aunt Mônica had painted a picture for her of what awaited their child—still greater poverty and with the child possibly dying as a result. Cândido Neves had no option but to keep his promise; he asked Clara to give the child the last milk he would take from his mother. Once fed, the little one fell asleep, and his father picked him up and headed off toward Rua dos Barbonos.",CO210CL10
18967,79,"More than once, he considered simply taking him back to the house; he also kept him carefully wrapped up, kissing him and covering his face to protect him from the damp night air. As he entered Rua da Guarda Velha, Cândido Neves slowed his pace.",CO210CL10

18969,81,"However, since the street was not infinite in length, he would soon reach the end; it was then that it occurred to him to go down one of the alleyways connecting that street to Rua da Ajuda. He reached the bottom of the alleyway and was about to turn right, in the direction of Largo da Ajuda, when, on the opposite side, he saw a woman: the runaway slave.",CO210CL10
18970,82,"I will not even attempt to describe Cândido Neves’s emotions, because I could not do so with the necessary intensity. One adjective will have to suffice; let’s say “overwhelming.” The woman walked down the street, and he followed; the pharmacy we mentioned earlier was only a few steps away. He went in, spoke to the pharmacist, and asked if he would be so kind as to look after the baby for a moment; he would return soon.",CO210CL10
18971,83,"“Yes, but—”",CO210CL10
18972,84,"Cândido Neves did not give him time to say anything more; he left at once, crossed the street, and continued on to a point where he could arrest the woman without making too much of a scene. At the end of the street, when she was about to head off down Rua de São José, Cândido Neves drew nearer. Yes, it was definitely her, the fugitive mulatta.",CO210CL10
18973,85,"“Arminda,” he called, for that was the name given in the advertisement.",CO210CL10
18974,86,"Arminda innocently turned around, and it was only when he removed the length of rope from his pocket and grabbed her arms that she realized what was happening and tried to flee. By then it was too late. With his strong hands, Cândido Neves had bound her wrists together and was ordering her to walk.",CO210CL10
18975,87,"She tried to scream, and she did perhaps call out more loudly than usual, but saw at once that no one would come to free her; on the contrary. She then begged him, for the love of God, to let her go.",CO210CL10
18976,88,"“I’m pregnant, sir!” she cried. “If you yourself have a child, I beg you for the love of that child to let me go. I’ll be your slave and serve you for as long as you like. Please, sir, let me go!”",CO210CL10

18980,92,"There was a struggle at this point, because she, heavy with her unborn child, kept moaning and resisting. Anyone passing by or standing in a shop doorway would have realized what was going on and would, naturally, have done nothing to help. Arminda was telling him that her master was a very bad man and would probably beat her, and in her present state that would be even harder to endure. Yes, there was no doubt about it, he would have her beaten.",CO210CL10
18981,93,“It’s your own fault. Who told you to get pregnant and then run away?” Cândido Neves asked.,CO210CL10
18982,94,"He was not in the best of moods because he had his own child waiting for him at the pharmacy, and, besides, he had never been a great talker. He continued to drag her down Rua dos Ourives toward Rua da Alfândega, where her master lived.",CO210CL10
18983,95,"On the corner, she struggled still more fiercely, planting her feet against the wall and trying vainly to pull away from him. All that she achieved, though, with the house now so near, was to delay her arrival a little. They did at last arrive, she reluctant, desperate, panting. Even then, she knelt down, but again to no avail. Her master was at home and ran out to see what all the noise and shouting were about.",CO210CL10

18987,99,"“Come on, in you come!”",CO210CL10
18988,100,"In the hallway, Arminda stumbled and fell. And there and then her master opened his wallet and took out two fifty-mil-réis notes, which Cândido Neves immediately pocketed, while the master again ordered Arminda to come into the house. Instead, on the floor where she lay, overcome by fear and pain, she went into labor and gave birth to her now-dead child.",CO210CL10
18989,101,"That unripe fruit entered the world amid the cries and moans of the mother and the despairing gestures of the master. Cândido Neves watched the whole spectacle. He had no idea of the time, but whatever the hour, he urgently needed to go back to Rua da Ajuda, which is precisely what he did, quite indifferent to the consequences of the disaster he had just witnessed.",CO210CL10
18990,102,"When he arrived at the shop, he found the pharmacist alone, with no son to return to him. Cândido’s first instinct was to throttle the man. Fortunately, the pharmacist quickly explained that the child was inside with the family, and when both men went in, Cândido Neves furiously snatched up the baby, much as he had grabbed the runaway slave a little earlier—a very different fury, of course, the fury of love.",CO210CL10
18991,103,"He brusquely thanked the pharmacist; then, with his son in his arms and the reward in his pocket, he raced off, not to the foundling hospital, but back to their temporary lodgings. When Aunt Mônica heard his explanation, she forgave him for bringing the child back, given that he also brought with him the hundred mil-réis.",CO210CL10
18992,104,"She did have a few harsh words to say about the slave-woman, though, both for running away and for having miscarried. Kissing his son and shedding genuine tears, Cândido Neves, on the other hand, blessed the fugitive and gave barely a thought to her dead child.",CO210CL10

18995,2,"The first thing that will surprise the reader is the title, which indicates to him (I can say so from the outset) three women and one woman alone. There are two ways of accounting for this anomaly: either two women come into the story indirectly, are hardly mentioned, and pull the strings of the action from the other side of the page or the women are no more than three gradations, three successive states of the same person. These are the two ostensible ways of explaining the title, and yet it’s not either of them, but a third way, which I keep to myself, not to pique curiosity but because there’s no analyzing it without revealing the matter.",CO159CL08
18996,3,"I am going to reveal the matter. Let’s begin with her, the one woman and three. She is sitting in a shop on Rua da Quitanda, by the counter, where there are five or six boxes of lace open and spread out. She’s not picking anything out, she’s waiting for the clerk to bring her more lace, and she’s looking out at the paving stones on the street, not at the people going by. She’s wearing black, and her bust, rather squeezed into silk, is adorned with fine lace and glass beads. She is fanning herself out of absentmindedness; perhaps she is looking at the street out of absentmindedness, too. Regardless, she is fanning herself and looking out.",CO159CL08
18997,4,"Again and again, she brings her gaze back into the shop and looks over the other counters, where there are women who are also making choices, chatting, and buying; but it’s hard to make out the slightest trace of interest or curiosity in the woman’s movements. Her eyes go from one side to the other, and her head follows them, with neither heart nor life, and then to the designs on her fan. She examines the designs closely, as if they were new, holds them up, puts them down, closes the closes the slats one by one, opens them again, closes them altogether, and taps on her knee with the fan. Do not let such details bother you; there’s not a single word there that isn’t necessary.",CO159CL08
18998,5,"“Here are the ones I think you’ll like,” said the clerk, returning.",CO159CL08
18999,6,"The woman picked up two new pieces of lacework, gave them a distracted look—or nearly idle, I might say. She holds them between her fingers, looking wide-eyed at them; then she seeks better light; then, for a long time, she compares them to other pieces. The clerk shadows her movements, helps her, without impatience, because he knows she will take her time and end up buying. She is a regular customer. She often comes for an hour, two hours, and sometimes more. Today, for example, she came in at half past two; it’s three o’clock, and she has already bought two pieces of lace. It’s something; she could have picked out nothing at all.",CO159CL08

19002,9,“Look; this very width.”,CO159CL08
19003,10,"As the clerk goes to check, she takes an absentminded look at the other pieces, starts fanning herself again, and finally goes back to staring at the paving stones in the street. It’s not that the stones can bear her any ill will, because her eyes are pretty, and what’s hidden inside, as Solomon said, doesn’t seem any less pretty. They are also light-colored, and they move beneath a sublime head.",CO159CL08
19004,11,"To assess the love of those eyes for the paving stones, it must be kept in mind that the field of view is often traversed by other bodies, men’s trousers, women’s dresses, a carriage or two, but it’s unusual for her eyes to shift for more than a few seconds. At times, they are looking so absently that they don’t even shift; no body blocks the view. Either out of fatigue or for some other reason they are closing now, slowly, slowly, not to sleep or drop off but maybe to reflect, maybe to do nothing at all.",CO159CL08
19005,12,"The fan, little by little, comes to a stop and drops, open, into the woman’s lap. But here’s the clerk coming back, and she returns to her study of the pieces of lace, to the comparison, to the scrutiny, only to find that one piece has the best material, another the best pattern, and still another the best price. The clerk, leaning over, cheerful, provides information, argues, makes demonstrations, yields, and ultimately closes the deal; the woman takes so many meters of one and so many of the other.",CO159CL08
19006,13,"She made the purchase; now she is paying. She draws a small wallet from her purse, takes out a small roll of bills, and idly peels one off, as the clerk draws up the bill in pencil. She gives him the bill; he takes it and the lace she has bought and goes to the cash-box; then he brings her the change and her purchases.",CO159CL08

It looks to her as if it’s about to rain; she says so to the clerk, who says it isn’t, and with reason, since the weather is stable. But it could be that the woman said so the way she would say anything else, or nothing at all. The fact is that she has her bundle hanging on her finger, the fan closed in her hand, her sun hat picked up, held by the end, ready to leave, but not leaving.",CO159CL08
19010,17,"Her gaze went back to the street, to the paving stones, as fixed as a lunatic’s idea. Leaning over the counter, the clerk said something to her, a word or two, in response to the malicious smile of a fellow clerk who is at the facing counter. It is this fellow’s opinion that the lady in question, who will have no one but that very clerk wait on her, is in love with him. Seeing that she is ready to leave but isn’t leaving, he smiles roguishly but on the sly, looking at the needles he is showing a client. Thus the other man’s words, about this or that, words the woman doesn’t hear, because her eyes really are fixed and absent.",CO159CL08
19011,18,"I have already mentioned the men’s trousers that from time to time traverse the field of vision of this woman of ours. Everyone who knows how to read, who is familiar with the spirit of the graduate Garcia, understood that I didn’t note this circumstance for the idle pleasure of saying that trousers are going by in the street, but for a higher and more secret reason; to accompany from afar a man’s entrance to the shop. A total effect of artistry; calculation and a combination of gestures. Thus are studied works; thus are the slow fruits of long gestation.",CO159CL08
19012,19,"I could have this man enter with no prior lead up; I could have him enter just so, hat in hand, and greet the lady, who, calling him doctor, asks him how he is; but I wonder if it isn’t better for the reader, even without knowing it, to be forewarned of such an entrance. There are no two answers.",CO159CL08
19013,20,"If she called him doctor, he called her dona Clara; they spoke for at most ten minutes, until she was ready to leave once and for all. So she said to the new arrival, at least. He was a man of thirty-two to thirty-four years old, not ugly, pleasant more than handsome, with marked northern features, of medium height and a great look of seriousness.",CO159CL08
19014,21,"He was of a mind to stay there with her, even half an hour, or to accompany her home. The proof is in the tender, submissive, nearly imploring air he talks to her with; her manners are not at all encouraging. She gave him a smile or two, but a meaningless smile, or one with this meaning: “I know what you want; go your way.”",CO159CL08
19015,22,"“Well,” he said, “if you are taking leave of me—”",CO159CL08

He waited five minutes, then ten, ten twenty; at twenty-one minutes she emerged from the shop. He was so excited he was unable to savor anything; he was unable to admire from afar our lady’s truly majestic figure.",CO159CL08
19021,28,"On the contrary, it seems even as if it were hurting him. He bit his lip beneath his mustache and walked in the other direction, resolving not to go to Matias’s, then resolving to do the opposite, eager to keep that woman out of his sight and not wanting anything but to keep her there in front of him for all eternity. It seems enigmatic, and yet there’s nothing clearer.",CO159CL08

19030,37,“Senhora is waiting for dinner.”,CO159CL08
19031,38,"This time, she got up and went to eat. Dona Antônia gave her the latest family news; Clara mentioned a few incidents from outside. The most important was the meeting with Dr. Severiano. That name of the man we saw in the shop on Rua da Quitanda.",CO159CL08
19032,39,"“It’s true,” said the mother. “We have to go to Matias’s house.”",CO159CL08
19033,40,“What an inconvenience!” sighed Clara.,CO159CL08
19034,41,“What doesn’t inconvenience you?” burst out dona Antônia. “What could be so bad about having a nice evening with half a dozen people? Before midnight it will be all over.”,CO159CL08
19035,42,"This Matias was one of the authors of the situation in which Severiano finds himself. The Ministry of Justice was the other. Severiano had come from the north to come to an agreement with the government about a transfer: he was a judge in Paraíba. To be given the judicial district he was asking for, another transfer had to be completed, and the ministry told him to wait.",CO159CL08
19036,43,"He waited, and he paid Matias, a lawyer and a native of his home province, a few visits. It was there one night that he met our Clara and ended up infatuated with her. It wasn’t yet passion; for that reason, he spoke rather openly to his friend, admitted he thought she was pretty. The two of them even made a few cautious and innocent jokes, but in the end Matias asked him:",CO159CL08
19037,44,"“Seriously, now, why don’t you marry her?”",CO159CL08
19038,45,“Marry her?”,CO159CL08

19040,47,“Yes.”,CO159CL08
19041,48,“She’s twenty-eight; you’re just right for each other. Okay?”,CO159CL08
19042,49,“It’s not okay.”,CO159CL08
19043,50,"“Well, my friend,” said Matias, shaking his head, “you won’t have a brief fling; she’s a very serious woman. The devil! You are certainly going to marry again; if it’s just to end up with some woman who doesn’t deserve anything, wouldn’t this woman—and I can vouch for her—be better?”",CO159CL08
19044,51,"Severiano rejected the suggestion but agreed that the woman was pretty. A widow of whom? Matias told him that she was the widow of lawyer and had received something from him: an income of six contos. It wasn’t much, but with a judge’s salary in a good district, it was enough to raise heaven on earth, and only a fool would turn his back on such a trove.",CO159CL08
19045,52,"“As for me, I wash my hands,” he concluded.",CO159CL08
19046,53,"“You can wipe them on the wall,” replied Severiano, laughing.",CO159CL08
19047,54,"A bad response; bad, I say, because unnecessary. Matias was helpful to the point of being annoying. He sensed that he would have to see to it that they got married, even if it were as hard as marrying the Sublime Porte and the Republic of Venice; and once he had sensed it, he swore to get it done. He had a lot of small get-togethers, got them chatting several times, and he invited them to the parties he sometimes gave; he demonstrated patience and tenacity. Severiano resisted, but he didn’t resist for long; he was wounded, and he fell.",CO159CL08
19048,55,"Clara, for all that, didn’t give him the slightest encouragement, to the point that if the Ministry of Justice were to expedite matters, Severiano would flee right away, without thinking anything more about anything; it’s what he said to himself, sincerely, but, given the difference between what’s living and what’s painted, we can assume that he would flee slowly, and maybe even that he would allow himself to stay. The truth is that he began to stop running after the minister, on the pretext that it was better not to exhaust his good will; entreaties spoil everything.",CO159CL08
19049,56,"And he turned back to Clara, who went on not treating him badly, without for all that exceeding the bounds of strict politeness. At times it seemed to him he saw in her manner a kind of duress, as if of a person who is barely tolerating another. It wasn’t hatred; why hatred? But no one can prevent an aversion, and the best people in the world might not be drawn to each other. Her manner in the shop—so cold! so dry!—confirmed his suspicions.",CO159CL08
19050,57,"“There’s no doubt,” he thought. “She detests me. But what did I do to her?”",CO159CL08
19051,58,"Between going to Matias’s house and not going, Severiano opted for a middle way: going late, very late. The secret reason is so childish I don’t have the heart to bring it up; but love excuses everything. The secret reason was to hide any eagerness, to show he didn’t care about her, and to see if that way. . . .",CO159CL08
19052,59,"You have understood, haven’t you? It was the application of that school of thought, whether Oriental or Occidental I still don’t know, in which the woman is compared to a shadow: if you follow the shadow, it flees; flee it, and it follows. The childishness of love—or, to be downright redundant: the childishness of a child. Lord knows if it was hard for him to wait! But wait he did, reading, walking around, chewing on his mustache, looking at the floor, bringing his watch to his ear to make sure it hadn’t stopped. In the end, he left; it was ten o’clock when he entered the parlor.",CO159CL08
19053,60,“So late!” Matias said to him. “This lady has already mentioned your absence.”,CO159CL08
19054,61,"Severiano offered a cold greeting, but the widow, who was looking crosswise at him, could tell it was affectation. She seemed to smile, but it was to herself; in any case, she asked him to sit next to her; she wanted to consult him about something, an argument she had had the evening before with the wife of the chief of police. Severiano sat down unsteadily.",CO159CL08
19055,62,"The topic of the consultation is of no concern to us; it was a pretext for a chat. Severiano delayed giving the answer he had been asked for as long as he could, and when he gave it to her, it was of so little importance to her that she no longer knew what it was about. She looked at the mirror, then, or at the curtains; at the curtains, I think.",CO159CL08
19056,63,"Matias, who had been watching them from afar, went over to them, sat down, and said he had a revelation on the tip of his tongue.”",CO159CL08
19057,64,"“Speak up; speak up,” she insisted.",CO159CL08
19058,65,“Shall I?” he asked the other fellow.,CO159CL08
19059,66,"Severiano blushed and didn’t respond right away, but, since his friend was insisting, he said he should. Here I ask forgiveness for Matias’s frivolousness and insolence; I’m not going to come up with a serious and skillful man just to keep from making a certain impression on my women readers. The revelation he had in mind was that of Severiano’s coming departure, a complete lie whose sole aim was provoke on dona Clara’s part a kind word, a request, a hope. The fact is that dona Clara was sorry. What? Was he already leaving? And not to return?",CO159CL08
19060,67,"“In the end I will be forced to do just that,” said Severiano. “I can’t stay here my whole life. I’ve already been here for a long time; my leave is about up.”",CO159CL08
19061,68,"“You see?” said Matias, turning back to the widow.",CO159CL08
19062,69,"Clara smiled, but she said nothing. In the meantime, the judge, enthused, confessed that he wouldn’t leave without missing Rio terribly. I’ll take with me the best memories of my life, he concluded.",CO159CL08
19063,70,"The rest of the night was pleasant. Severiano left with his hopes revived. It was clear that the widow would come to accept him, he thought to himself; and his earlier impression that she hated him was just foolish. Why would she hate him? It could be at most antipathy, but it wasn’t antipathy, either. The proof was the way she treated him; on the way out, it seemed to him that she even gave him a firmer handshake. He wouldn’t swear, but it seemed to him. . . .",CO159CL08
19064,71,"This period lasted a bit more than a week. The following encounter was at her house, where he went to pay her a visit. Clara received him without much to-do, heard him tell her a few things without paying him much heed, but, since she ultimately admitted she had a headache, Severiano clung to that reason to explain manners that smacked of contempt. The second encounter was at the theater.",CO159CL08
19065,72,"“What do you think of the play?” she asked, when he entered the box.",CO159CL08
19066,73,“It’s good.”,CO159CL08
19067,74,"“Precisely,” said the mother. “It’s Clara who’s in a bad mood.”",CO159CL08
19068,75,“Really?”,CO159CL08
19069,76,"“A mother’s silly ideas. But you think the play is good, then?”",CO159CL08
19070,77,“It doesn’t seem bad to me.”,CO159CL08
19071,78,“Why?”,CO159CL08
19072,79,"Severiano smiled, then he tried to come up with a few of the reasons that made him think the play was good. As he spoke, she looked at him, fanning herself, then some of the light went out of her eyes; finally, she brought the open fan to her mouth to yawn. That, at least, was what he thought, and we can imagine if he thought it happily. The mother endorsed everything, because she was enjoying the performance, and she was all the sincerer for not having wanted to go to the theater; but her daughter had insisted until she had had no choice but to give in.",CO159CL08
19073,80,"She gave in, went, enjoyed the play, and it was her daughter who was in a bad mood and anxious to leave. She said all of this to the judge with a laugh; Clara remonstrated, looked at the stage, fanned herself, covered her mouth, and seemed to be imploring God if not to destroy the universe then at least to get that man out of the box. Severiano could tell he was not wanted and he left.",CO159CL08
19074,81,"For the first few minutes he didn’t know what to think, but, finally, he went back over their talk, thought about the widow’s manner, and concluded that there had to be some lover.",CO159CL08
19075,82,"“There’s no doubt; that’s what it is,” he said to himself. “She wanted to go to the theater, expecting to see him; not finding him, she’s irritated. That’s all it is.”",CO159CL08
19076,83,"It was the second explanation for the widow’s manner. The first, hatred or natural aversion, was dismissed as unlikely. What was left was an infatuation, which was not only likely but also had everything going for it. At that point, Severiano realized that the only seemly behavior was to abandon the field, and so he did. To avoid Matias’s sermons, he didn’t say anything, and he paid him only a handful of visits.",CO159CL08
19077,84,"Five or six weeks went by that way. One day, he ran into Clara in the street. He greeted her; she spoke coldly to him and went on her way. He saw her two more times, once in the same shop on Rua da Quitanda, another time at the door to a dentist’s. No change for the better; it was all over.",CO159CL08
19078,85,"In the meantime, the response to Severiano’s request, his transfer to another district, came through. He got ready to set out, to the great astonishment of his friend Matias, who assumed the courtship was well underway and believed they had entered the phase of discretion. When he found out he was wrong, he was astounded. Severiano told him there was nothing doing; Clara was having some affair.",CO159CL08
19079,86,"“I don’t think so,” said Matias. “She’s an austere woman.”",CO159CL08
19080,87,"“Then it will be an austere affair,” concurred the judge. “In any case, I’m wasting my time, and I’m leaving.”",CO159CL08
19081,88,"Matias ignored his opinion and ended up saying that once he recused himself he would do nothing more—except for one thing. That thing—he didn’t say what it was—was nothing less than to go straight to the widow’s and talk to her about his friend’s passion. Clara knew that she was loved, but she had hardly imagined the passion Matias described to her, and her first impression was of annoyance.",CO159CL08
19082,89,“What do you want me to do?”,CO159CL08
19083,90,“I’m asking you to think it over and see if such a distinguished man isn’t a husband made in heaven. I don’t know another man so deserving. . . .”,CO159CL08

19087,94,“And why not to you?”,CO159CL08
19088,95,"Clara smiled, and, resting her elbows on the arms of the chair, she started toying with her fingers. The persistence was beginning to annoy her. She was capable of yielding, if only to keep from having to hear more talk of the subject. Ultimately, she seized on the material impossibility; he was heading for a district in the interior; she would never leave Rio de Janeiro.",CO159CL08
19089,96,“That’s the problem?” asked Matias.,CO159CL08
19090,97,“Does it strike you as a minor one?”,CO159CL08
19091,98,“So if he were to stay here you would marry?”,CO159CL08
19092,99,"“I would,” Clara replied, gazing absentmindedly at the chandelier drops.",CO159CL08
19093,100,"Damned absentmindedness! It was what did her in, since Matias made use of that response for a covenant. The point was to get Severiano to stay, and that undertaking took him no more than ten minutes. Clara, caught in the net, put up a good face and accepted the fiancé with a smile. She even lavished such endearments on him that he thought of his friend’s words; he believed that, at heart, she was very much in love with him and that she had done nothing other than give in little by little.",CO159CL08
19094,101,"But this third reason was as far from reality as the other two; she didn’t love him or hate him, and neither did she love anyone else. The sole truth is that she was a perfect example of moral inertia; and she got married to be done with Matias’s badgering. She would have married the devil, if necessary. With time, Severiano recognized this very thing. Clara, once married, went on being what she had always been—capable of spending two hours in a shop, four on a couch, twenty in a bed, with her mind on nothing at all.",CO159CL08

19420,14,"There I was, at sixteen years of age, all on my own, friendless and penniless. A canon at the Imperial Chapel tried to get me employment as a sacristan, but although I had often served at mass in Mato Grosso and knew some Latin, I was not admitted due to a lack of vacancies. Others encouraged me to study law, and I accepted with grim determination. I even had some help to begin with, and when that stopped, I soldiered on and finally managed to get my bachelor’s degree. Now, don’t tell me that this was an exception in my life of misfortune, because my academic qualification brought me to an even sorrier state of affairs; however, since destiny was determined to punish me whatever my chosen profession, I do not blame my law degree for that. It’s true that I was very pleased to obtain it; my tender age and a certain superstitious belief in the need to improve oneself made of that roll of parchment the diamond key that would open every door to good fortune.",CO135CL12

No, sir; beside it there were ten or fifteen others, the fruits of a love affair begun in Rio de Janeiro during Holy Week of 1842, with a widow seven or eight years my senior, but fiery, good-humored, and rich.

19427,21,"I left the capital and went to practice as a country lawyer, but not for long. Misfortune rode behind me on my mule, and wherever I got off, it got off with me.

19433,27,"He said one or two other things, too, and invited me to dinner that Sunday. I went, and fell in love with his daughter, Dona Rufina, a very pretty girl of nineteen, but rather shy and insipid. Perhaps it’s her upbringing, I thought. We married a few months later.",CO135CL12
19434,28,"I didn’t, of course, invite misfortune to the wedding, but inside the church, among the neatly trimmed beards and luxuriant side-whiskers, I thought I saw the sardonic face and glancing eyes of my cruel adversary.

19435,29,"I was married. It is true that Rufina lacked brilliance and elegance; it was immediately apparent, for example, that she would never be a society hostess. She did, however, possess the qualities of a good housewife, and that was all I asked for. A quiet life was enough for me, and as long as she filled that life, all would be well. But this was precisely the fly in the ointment.",CO135CL12
19436,30,"If you will permit me a chromatic illustration, Rufina’s soul was not black like Lady Macbeth’s, or red like Cleopatra’s, or blue like Juliet’s, or white like Beatrice’s, but gray and dull like the lumpen mass of humanity. She was kind only out of apathy, faithful but not out of virtue, friendly but never intentionally tender. An angel might carry her up to heaven, or the devil down to hell, in either case without any struggle on her part, and without her meriting either glory in the first case or shame in the second.",CO135CL12
19437,31,"Hers was the passivity of a sleepwalker. She was not in the least bit vain. Her father had hatched the marriage because he wanted his son-in-law to be a man with a profession; she accepted me just as she would have accepted any sacristan, magistrate, general, civil servant, or lieutenant, and not out of impatience to be married, but out of obedience to her family and, to a certain extent, so as to be like everyone else. All the other women had husbands, so she wanted one too. Nothing could have been more antipathetic to my nature, but married I was.",CO135CL12
19438,32,"Happily—ah! a “happily” in this the final chapter of an unlucky man is, it’s true, something of an anomaly. But carry on reading and you will see that the adverb is simply a matter of style, not of life; it is a way of moving the story along, nothing more. What I am going to say will not alter what has already been said. I will say that Rufina’s domestic qualities were greatly to her credit. She was modest; she did not care for balls, or walks, or gazing out of windows.",CO135CL12
19439,33,"She kept to herself. She didn’t toil away at domestic chores, nor was this necessary, for my work provided her with everything, and all her dresses and hats came from “the French ladies,” as we used to call the seamstresses in those days. In between giving orders to the servants, Rufina would sit for hours and hours, letting her spirits yawn, killing time, that hundred-headed hydra that would never die. But, I repeat, despite all her shortcomings, she was a good housewife.",CO135CL12
19440,34,"As for me, I played the role of the frogs in Aesop’s Fables who wanted a king, the difference being that when Jupiter threw me down a lump of wood, I didn’t ask him for another king, knowing he’d send a snake that would come and swallow me up. “Long live the lump of wood!” I said to myself. I only mention these things to show the steadfast logic of my fate.",CO135CL12

Happily, after a year and a half, a sign of hope appeared on the horizon, and, judging by the excitement the news aroused in me, it was a supreme and unique sign of hope. The thing I most desired was on its way. What thing? A child. My life changed in an instant. Everything smiled upon me as on the day of a wedding.",CO135CL12
19442,36,"I prepared a royal reception for the baby; I bought an expensive cradle finely carved from ebony and ivory; then, little by little, I bought all the other items for the layette; I set the seamstresses to work on the finest cambrics, the warmest flannels, a lovely little lace bonnet; I bought him a pram, and I waited and waited, ready to dance before him like David dancing before the Ark . . . Ah, woe is me! The Ark entered Jerusalem empty; the child was stillborn.",CO135CL12
19443,37,"The person who consoled me in my despair was Gonçalves, who was to have been the child’s godfather, and was our friend, companion, and confidant. “Be patient,” he said, “I’ll be godfather to the next one.” And he comforted me, and talked to me about other things with the tenderness of a true friend. Time did the rest. Gonçalves himself told me later on that if the child was destined to be unlucky, as I was convinced he would be, then he was better off stillborn.",CO135CL12
19444,38,“What makes you think he wouldn’t have been born unlucky?” I retorted.,CO135CL12
19445,39,"Gonçalves smiled; he didn’t believe in my rotten luck. In fact he had no time to believe in anything; he devoted himself entirely to being happy. He had finally begun to apply himself to the law; he was now pleading cases, presenting petitions, attending court, all because, as he used to say, he needed to live. And he was always happy. My wife found him very amusing; she would laugh at his little stories and jokes, which at times were somewhat risqué.",CO135CL12
19446,40,"At first I reprimanded him privately, but eventually I grew used to them. After all, who wouldn’t pardon the talents of a friend, and such a jovial friend at that? I must say that, eventually, he began to rein himself in, and, from then on, I began to find him a far more serious companion. “You’re in love,” I said to him one day, and he, turning pale, replied that he was, and added with a smile, albeit weakly, that he, too, must marry. Over supper that evening, I returned to the subject.",CO135CL12

19450,44,"And here’s a strange thing: while she lived, our differing temperaments weakened the ties between us, which were based principally on necessity and habit. Death, with its great spiritual power, changed everything. Rufina now seemed to me like the bride in the Song of Songs who descends from Lebanon, and the divergence between us was replaced by a complete fusion of our beings.",CO135CL12

19452,46,"It was a defiant challenge to my evil star; I was building the fortress of destiny on solid, indestructible rock. Please understand me: everything that had, up until then, depended on the exterior world was naturally precarious: roof tiles fell when hammocks swayed, surplices turned their backs on sacristans, widows’ vows fled arm in arm with friends’ dogmas, lawyers’ cases came but fleetingly or sank without trace; finally, children were born dead.",CO135CL12
19453,47,"But the image of a dead woman was immortal, and with it I could defy the malicious gaze of misfortune. I held happiness captive in my hands, its great condor wings beating the air, while owl-like misfortune flapped its wings and vanished into night and silence . . .",CO135CL12
19454,48,"One day, however, while convalescing from a fever, I had the notion of drawing up an inventory of my dead wife’s possessions. I began with a little box that hadn’t been opened since she had died five months previously. I found inside a large number of odds and ends: needles, threads, scraps of lace, a thimble, a pair of scissors, a prayer of Saint Cyprian, a list of clothes, other bits and pieces, and a bundle of letters tied with a blue ribbon.",CO135CL12
19455,49,"I undid the ribbon and opened the letters: they were from Gonçalves . . . Ah, it’s noon already! I must finish; my manservant will be back at any moment, and then that would be that. No one can imagine how time rushes by in these circumstances; minutes fly like fleeting empires, and, more importantly on this occasion, the leaves of paper fly with them.",CO135CL12
19456,50,"I won’t dwell on the discarded lottery tickets, the aborted business deals, the interrupted love affairs; still less on fate’s other petty grudges. Weary and dismayed, I realized that I would not find happiness anywhere; I went even further: I believed that it did not exist anywhere on Earth, and, since yesterday, I have been preparing myself for my great plunge into eternity.",CO135CL12
19457,51,"This morning, I had breakfast, smoked a cigar, and leaned out the window. After ten minutes, I saw a well-dressed man walk by, and he kept looking down at his feet. I knew him by sight; he had been the victim of many great misfortunes, but he smiled as he walked, and stared his feet, or, rather, his boots. They were new, patent leather, beautifully made, and no doubt impeccably stitched.",CO135CL12
19458,52,"From time to time, he looked up at the windows, or at people’s faces, but his eyes quickly darted back to his boots, as if drawn to them by a law of attraction stronger than his own will. He was a happy fellow; one could see the blissful expression on his face. He was clearly happy; and yet he may have had no breakfast; he might not even have so much as a penny in his pocket, but he was happy gazing at his boots.",CO135CL12
19459,53,"Could happiness be a pair of boots? That man, so buffeted by life, had finally found fortune smiling on him. Nothing is worth nothing. No worldly preoccupation, no social or moral dilemma, neither the joys of the new generation nor the sorrows of the old, neither poverty nor class warfare, no artistic or political crisis, nothing is worth as much to him as a pair of boots.",CO135CL12
19460,54,"He gazes at them, he breathes them in, he glows, in them he treads the surface of an orb that belongs only to him. Thence comes the dignity of his posture, the firmness of his step, and a certain air of Olympian tranquility. Yes, happiness is a pair of boots.",CO135CL12

My friend and the lady in question were most indignant when they found out about the beating I had received, but secretly they were rather pleased that I had been beaten and not him. Nor will I speak of certain illnesses I have suffered.",CO135CL10
19475,13,"I will hasten to the point when my father, having been poor all his life, died in extreme poverty, and my mother survived him by less than two months. Canon Brito, who had just been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, proposed taking me with him to Rio de Janeiro with the idea of making a priest of me; however, five days after we arrived, he died. You see what I mean when I say I have always been unlucky.",CO135CL10
19476,14,"There I was, at sixteen years of age, all on my own, friendless and penniless. A canon at the Imperial Chapel tried to get me employment as a sacristan, but although I had often served at mass in Mato Grosso and knew some Latin, I was not admitted due to a lack of vacancies. Others encouraged me to study law, and I accepted with grim determination. I even had some help to begin with, and when that stopped, I soldiered on and finally managed to get my bachelor’s degree. Now, don’t tell me that this was an exception in my life of misfortune, because my academic qualification brought me to an even sorrier state of affairs; however, since destiny was determined to punish me whatever my chosen profession, I do not blame my law degree for that. It’s true that I was very pleased to obtain it; my tender age and a certain superstitious belief in the need to improve oneself made of that roll of parchment the diamond key that would open every door to good fortune.",CO135CL10
19477,15,"And, to begin with, my bachelor’s degree was not the only piece of paper in my pocket. No, sir; beside it there were ten or fifteen others, the fruits of a love affair begun in Rio de Janeiro during Holy Week of 1842, with a widow seven or eight years my senior, but fiery, good-humored, and rich. She lived with her blind brother on Rua do Conde; I can’t say any more than that.",CO135CL10
19478,16,"All my friends were aware of this relationship; two of them even read the letters, which I showed them on the pretext of admiring the widow’s elegant style, but really so that they could read the marvelous things she said to me. In everyone’s opinion, our marriage was a certainty, an absolute certainty; the widow was merely waiting for me to finish my studies. When I graduated, one of these friends congratulated me, underlining his certainty with this definitive sentence:",CO135CL10
19479,17,“Your marriage is pure dogma.”,CO135CL10
19480,18,"And, laughing, he asked if, on account of that dogma, I could lend him fifty mil-réis, which he needed urgently. I didn’t have fifty mil-réis on me, but that word “dogma” was still reverberating so sweetly within me that I didn’t rest all day until I had obtained the money. I happily took it to him myself, and he received it gratefully. Six months later, it was he who married the widow.",CO135CL10
19481,19,"I won’t tell you how I suffered then, only that my first impulse was to shoot them both. I did shoot them in my imagination, and watched them dying, gasping, begging for my forgiveness. This was a purely hypothetical revenge; in reality, I did nothing. They married, and went to the hills of Tijuca to watch the rising of their honeymoon moon. I was left rereading the widow’s letters.",CO135CL10
19482,20,"“As God is my witness,” said one of them, “my love is eternal, and I am yours, eternally yours . . .” And, in my bewilderment, I muttered blasphemies to myself: “Ours is a jealous God; he will suffer no eternity but his, and that is why he repudiated the widow’s words; nor will he suffer any dogma but Catholic dogma, and that is why he repudiated my friend’s words.” This was how I explained the loss of my fiancée and the fifty mil-réis.",CO135CL10
19483,21,"I left the capital and went to practice as a country lawyer, but not for long. Misfortune rode behind me on my mule, and wherever I got off, it got off with me. I saw its finger in everything, in the cases that never came my way, in the ones that did come but were worth little or nothing, and in the ones that were worth something but were invariably lost.",CO135CL10
19484,22,"Besides the fact that clients who win are generally more grateful than the other sort, my succession of defeats discouraged other litigants from contacting me. After a year and a half, I returned to Rio and set myself up with an old companion from my student days, Gonçalves.",CO135CL10
19485,23,"Gonçalves was the least juridically minded fellow imaginable, and the least suited to grappling with matters of law. In fact, he was an utter good-for-nothing. If one were to compare mental activity to an elegant house, Gonçalves was incapable of even ten minutes of polite drawing-room conversation—he would always be sneaking off down to the pantry to gossip with the servants.",CO135CL10
19486,24,"However, this baseness was compensated by a certain lucidity and agility in grasping less arduous or less complex subjects, together with a facility of expression and an almost uninterrupted good humor—something which for me, a poor devil beaten down by fortune, was not to be sneezed at.",CO135CL10
19487,25,"In the early days, when we had no cases to work on, we passed the time in excellent conversation, lively and animated, in which he always took the better part, whether discussing politics or—a subject that was of particular interest to him—women.",CO135CL10
19488,26,"But slowly the cases began to arrive; among them a dispute about a mortgage. It concerned the house of a customs official, Temístocles de Sá Botelho, who had no other assets and didn’t want to lose his property. I took charge of the matter. Temístocles was delighted with me, and, two weeks later, when I told him I wasn’t married, he laughed and said he wanted nothing to do with bachelors.",CO135CL10
19489,27,"He said one or two other things, too, and invited me to dinner that Sunday. I went, and fell in love with his daughter, Dona Rufina, a very pretty girl of nineteen, but rather shy and insipid. Perhaps it’s her upbringing, I thought. We married a few months later.",CO135CL10
19490,28,"I didn’t, of course, invite misfortune to the wedding, but inside the church, among the neatly trimmed beards and luxuriant side-whiskers, I thought I saw the sardonic face and glancing eyes of my cruel adversary. It was for this reason that, when the time came to utter the sacred and irreversible vows of marriage, I trembled and hesitated before, finally, stammeringly repeating the priest’s words . . .",CO135CL10
19491,29,"I was married. It is true that Rufina lacked brilliance and elegance; it was immediately apparent, for example, that she would never be a society hostess. She did, however, possess the qualities of a good housewife, and that was all I asked for. A quiet life was enough for me, and as long as she filled that life, all would be well. But this was precisely the fly in the ointment.",CO135CL10
19492,30,"If you will permit me a chromatic illustration, Rufina’s soul was not black like Lady Macbeth’s, or red like Cleopatra’s, or blue like Juliet’s, or white like Beatrice’s, but gray and dull like the lumpen mass of humanity. She was kind only out of apathy, faithful but not out of virtue, friendly but never intentionally tender. An angel might carry her up to heaven, or the devil down to hell, in either case without any struggle on her part, and without her meriting either glory in the first case or shame in the second.",CO135CL10
19493,31,"Hers was the passivity of a sleepwalker. She was not in the least bit vain. Her father had hatched the marriage because he wanted his son-in-law to be a man with a profession; she accepted me just as she would have accepted any sacristan, magistrate, general, civil servant, or lieutenant, and not out of impatience to be married, but out of obedience to her family and, to a certain extent, so as to be like everyone else. All the other women had husbands, so she wanted one too. Nothing could have been more antipathetic to my nature, but married I was.",CO135CL10
19494,32,"Happily—ah! a “happily” in this the final chapter of an unlucky man is, it’s true, something of an anomaly. But carry on reading and you will see that the adverb is simply a matter of style, not of life; it is a way of moving the story along, nothing more. What I am going to say will not alter what has already been said. I will say that Rufina’s domestic qualities were greatly to her credit. She was modest; she did not care for balls, or walks, or gazing out of windows.",CO135CL10
19495,33,"She kept to herself. She didn’t toil away at domestic chores, nor was this necessary, for my work provided her with everything, and all her dresses and hats came from “the French ladies,” as we used to call the seamstresses in those days. In between giving orders to the servants, Rufina would sit for hours and hours, letting her spirits yawn, killing time, that hundred-headed hydra that would never die. But, I repeat, despite all her shortcomings, she was a good housewife.",CO135CL10
19496,34,"As for me, I played the role of the frogs in Aesop’s Fables who wanted a king, the difference being that when Jupiter threw me down a lump of wood, I didn’t ask him for another king, knowing he’d send a snake that would come and swallow me up. “Long live the lump of wood!” I said to myself. I only mention these things to show the steadfast logic of my fate.",CO135CL10
19497,35,"Time for another “happily,” I think, and this time it isn’t just a way of moving between two sentences. Happily, after a year and a half, a sign of hope appeared on the horizon, and, judging by the excitement the news aroused in me, it was a supreme and unique sign of hope. The thing I most desired was on its way. What thing? A child. My life changed in an instant. Everything smiled upon me as on the day of a wedding.",CO135CL10
19498,36,"I prepared a royal reception for the baby; I bought an expensive cradle finely carved from ebony and ivory; then, little by little, I bought all the other items for the layette; I set the seamstresses to work on the finest cambrics, the warmest flannels, a lovely little lace bonnet; I bought him a pram, and I waited and waited, ready to dance before him like David dancing before the Ark . . . Ah, woe is me! The Ark entered Jerusalem empty; the child was stillborn.",CO135CL10
19499,37,"The person who consoled me in my despair was Gonçalves, who was to have been the child’s godfather, and was our friend, companion, and confidant. “Be patient,” he said, “I’ll be godfather to the next one.” And he comforted me, and talked to me about other things with the tenderness of a true friend. Time did the rest. Gonçalves himself told me later on that if the child was destined to be unlucky, as I was convinced he would be, then he was better off stillborn.",CO135CL10
19500,38,“What makes you think he wouldn’t have been born unlucky?” I retorted.,CO135CL10
19501,39,"Gonçalves smiled; he didn’t believe in my rotten luck. In fact he had no time to believe in anything; he devoted himself entirely to being happy. He had finally begun to apply himself to the law; he was now pleading cases, presenting petitions, attending court, all because, as he used to say, he needed to live. And he was always happy. My wife found him very amusing; she would laugh at his little stories and jokes, which at times were somewhat risqué.",CO135CL10
19502,40,"At first I reprimanded him privately, but eventually I grew used to them. After all, who wouldn’t pardon the talents of a friend, and such a jovial friend at that? I must say that, eventually, he began to rein himself in, and, from then on, I began to find him a far more serious companion. “You’re in love,” I said to him one day, and he, turning pale, replied that he was, and added with a smile, albeit weakly, that he, too, must marry. Over supper that evening, I returned to the subject.",CO135CL10
19503,41,"“Rufina, did you know that Gonçalves is getting married?”",CO135CL10
19504,42,"“It’s just his little joke,” Gonçalves said, interrupting me.",CO135CL10
19505,43,"I cursed my indiscretion, and neither he nor I mentioned it again. Five months later . . .—you must excuse the rapid transition, but there is no means of lengthening it out—five months later, Rufina fell seriously ill and, within a week, she had died of a rampant fever.",CO135CL10
19506,44,"And here’s a strange thing: while she lived, our differing temperaments weakened the ties between us, which were based principally on necessity and habit. Death, with its great spiritual power, changed everything. Rufina now seemed to me like the bride in the Song of Songs who descends from Lebanon, and the divergence between us was replaced by a complete fusion of our beings.",CO135CL10
19507,45,"I seized upon the image; it filled my soul, and with it she filled my life, where once she had occupied so little space and for so little time.",CO135CL10
19508,46,"It was a defiant challenge to my evil star; I was building the fortress of destiny on solid, indestructible rock. Please understand me: everything that had, up until then, depended on the exterior world was naturally precarious: roof tiles fell when hammocks swayed, surplices turned their backs on sacristans, widows’ vows fled arm in arm with friends’ dogmas, lawyers’ cases came but fleetingly or sank without trace; finally, children were born dead.",CO135CL10
19509,47,"But the image of a dead woman was immortal, and with it I could defy the malicious gaze of misfortune. I held happiness captive in my hands, its great condor wings beating the air, while owl-like misfortune flapped its wings and vanished into night and silence . . .",CO135CL10
19510,48,"One day, however, while convalescing from a fever, I had the notion of drawing up an inventory of my dead wife’s possessions. I began with a little box that hadn’t been opened since she had died five months previously. I found inside a large number of odds and ends: needles, threads, scraps of lace, a thimble, a pair of scissors, a prayer of Saint Cyprian, a list of clothes, other bits and pieces, and a bundle of letters tied with a blue ribbon.",CO135CL10
19511,49,"I undid the ribbon and opened the letters: they were from Gonçalves . . . Ah, it’s noon already! I must finish; my manservant will be back at any moment, and then that would be that. No one can imagine how time rushes by in these circumstances; minutes fly like fleeting empires, and, more importantly on this occasion, the leaves of paper fly with them.",CO135CL10
19512,50,"I won’t dwell on the discarded lottery tickets, the aborted business deals, the interrupted love affairs; still less on fate’s other petty grudges. Weary and dismayed, I realized that I would not find happiness anywhere; I went even further: I believed that it did not exist anywhere on Earth, and, since yesterday, I have been preparing myself for my great plunge into eternity.",CO135CL10
19513,51,"This morning, I had breakfast, smoked a cigar, and leaned out the window. After ten minutes, I saw a well-dressed man walk by, and he kept looking down at his feet. I knew him by sight; he had been the victim of many great misfortunes, but he smiled as he walked, and stared his feet, or, rather, his boots. They were new, patent leather, beautifully made, and no doubt impeccably stitched.",CO135CL10
19514,52,"From time to time, he looked up at the windows, or at people’s faces, but his eyes quickly darted back to his boots, as if drawn to them by a law of attraction stronger than his own will. He was a happy fellow; one could see the blissful expression on his face. He was clearly happy; and yet he may have had no breakfast; he might not even have so much as a penny in his pocket, but he was happy gazing at his boots.",CO135CL10
19515,53,"Could happiness be a pair of boots? That man, so buffeted by life, had finally found fortune smiling on him. Nothing is worth nothing. No worldly preoccupation, no social or moral dilemma, neither the joys of the new generation nor the sorrows of the old, neither poverty nor class warfare, no artistic or political crisis, nothing is worth as much to him as a pair of boots.",CO135CL10
19516,54,"He gazes at them, he breathes them in, he glows, in them he treads the surface of an orb that belongs only to him. Thence comes the dignity of his posture, the firmness of his step, and a certain air of Olympian tranquility. Yes, happiness is a pair of boots.",CO135CL10

I don’t know if I mentioned that this took place at the home of a baroness, who had her dressmaker come to her, rather than having to visit the shop. The seamstress arrived, picked up the fabric, picked up the needle, picked up the thread, threaded the needle, and began to sew. Between the seamstress’s fingers—which, to give the story a poetic touch, were as agile as the hounds of Diana—the needle and thread marched proudly onward across the fabric, which was the finest of silks. And the needle said to the thread:",CO168CL10

Seeing that no response was forthcoming, the needle, too, fell silent, and continued its work. Silence reigned in the little sewing room; nothing could be heard but the plic-plic-plic-plic of needle and fabric. As the sun began to set, the seamstress put away her sewing; the next day, and the day after, she carried on, until on the fourth day she finished her work, ready for the ball.",CO168CL10

After his age, his life; he had lived much, in another milieu, which he had left to hide himself in that house with that woman. I had experienced nothing, not with anyone.

She had admirable feet, and either they or her destiny was the cause of X’s love. I never asked her about the origin of their union; I only know that she had a daughter, who was away at boarding school and who didn’t come home; her mother went there to see her.

I say this not to explain my qualms, but only to help you understand my timidity.",CO212CL07
19571,28,"They had lived together for some years, one dedicated to the other. X trusted me, absolute trust, he confided in me about his dealings, revealed things about his past life. Despite our age difference, we were like students in the same class.",CO212CL07

19573,30,"Two days later, on my way to the post office, I met her sending a letter to Bahia. Have I not yet mentioned she was baiana? She was baiana. She saw me first and spoke. I helped her put on the stamp and we said farewell. At the door, I intended to say something else, when I saw before us, stopped, the figure of X.",CO212CL07
19574,31,"“I came to send mother’s letter,” she hastily offered.",CO212CL07
19575,32,"She said goodbye to us, and left for home; he and I headed in another direction. X took advantage of the occasion to compliment Maria. Without going into detail about the origin of their relations, he assured me that they had equally shared a deep passion, and he concluded that he was set for life.",CO212CL07

And then continuing to walk … she knows, and she has even made vague and remote allusions, but I noticed.",CO212CL07
19577,34,"That fact is she does not disapprove; she knows that Maria is serious and good, and seeing that I am happy, she asks for nothing more. Marriage would not give me more than this …",CO212CL07
19578,35,"He said many other things, which I heard without taking notice; my heart beat swiftly, my legs moved feebly. I struggled to respond suitably; the odd word I managed to speak, left me choked. After a time, he noticed my state of being and misinterpreted the cause; he supposed that his confidings bored me. I responded, serious:",CO212CL07

19580,37,"In hindsight, I believe I unconsciously gave into a necessary hypocrisy. The age of passions is confusing, and in that situation I cannot discern well between feelings and their causes. Still, it is not beside the point that I sought to dispel any possible suspicion in X’s mood.",CO212CL07
19581,38,"The truth is that he listened to me, appreciative. His large childlike eyes enveloped me, and when we said farewell, he shook my hand with energy. I believe I even heard him say: “Thank you!”",CO212CL07
19582,39,"I did not leave panic-stricken or wounded by my earlier remorse. The first impression of confidence drained, leaving only confidence, and I felt the excitement of curiosity swelling within me. X had spoken to me of Maria, how chaste and committed she was; not one allusion to her physical gifts, but my age required no direct references.",CO212CL07
19583,40,"Now, in the street, I could see from memory her figure, her movements equally impassive and robust, and with each passing moment I felt more outside of myself.

Because my ear was sharpened listening for Maria’s steps, I did not respond immediately, nor clearly, nor right away; I continued to sputter in response though always listening.

It was only an instant.",CO212CL07

19604,61,"I don’t know how I didn’t fall. Stunned, I walked down the front steps, the kiss on my mouth, my eyes in hers, and my hand instinctively grasping an object. I managed to distance myself from the house. At the first corner, I ran to a street lamp to see what I was holding. It was a card from a dry goods store, an advertisement, and on the back, this was written in pencil: “Wait for me tomorrow, by the ferries to Niterói at one in the afternoon.”",CO212CL07

But, although we were not sorry, it is not likely that we spoke of him, so brief was the time for our infinitude.

19618,75,"Our trimester ended quickly, as do all trimesters of that sort. One day Maria missed our meeting. She was always so punctual that I felt disoriented when the hour came and went. Five, ten, fifteen minutes; then twenty, then thirty, then forty … I will not say how many times I walked from one side of the room to the other, then into the hallway, on the lookout and listening, until the possibility of her coming had gone by.",CO212CL07
19619,76,"I’ll spare you the degree of my desperation, the time I spent lying on the ground, talking, yelling, or weeping. When I was exhausted, I wrote her a long letter; I waited for her to write me as well, explaining her absence. I did not send my letter, and that evening I went to their home.",CO212CL07
19620,77,"Maria could have explained her absence by her fear of being seen or followed by someone who had been pursuing for some time. In fact, she had already told me about some neighbor who had been flirting with her with some insistence; she once told me he had followed her to the door of my house. I believed her reason and so I proposed another location to meet, but she didn’t think it was convenient.",CO212CL07
19621,78,"This time she thought it better to suspend our meetings until the suspicions had quieted down. She would not leave her house. I did not understand then that the main reason was that her initial passion had ceased. And you cannot imagine what this beautiful creature had become, she was both fire and ice, and was hotter and colder than anyone.",CO212CL07
19622,79,"When I became convinced that everything had ended, I decided to stop going over, but even then I didn’t lose hope; to me it was a question of effort.

After five days, I went back; I could not live without her.",CO212CL07

I alleged a minor fever, and to explain the unpleasantness I could not overcome, I said that my head still ached. Maria understood everything; but even so she demonstrated no affection or sympathy, and when I got up to leave, she did not accompany me to the hallway as she usually did.",CO212CL07
19624,81,"All of this doubled my anguish. The idea of dying entered my head; and with a notion of romantic symmetry, I thought of getting on the ferry to Niterói where our love first began and throwing myself into the sea in the middle of the bay. I did not carry out this plan or any other.",CO212CL07

19626,83,"Raimunda was an adventurous spirit, a friend of enterprises and the latest news. She did not care, perhaps, for me or Maria, but she saw in this a predicament, an occupation, and she determined to reconcile us; this is what I learned later, and is what will occupy the rest of this paper.",CO212CL07
19627,84,"She spoke to Maria once and then again. Maria tried to deny it at first, but she ended up confessing everything, saying she was sorry for her blunder. They probably used circumlocutions and synonyms, vague and truncated phrases, perhaps only gestures. The only remaining text comes from Raimunda herself, who sent for me and then related all her efforts, content with herself.",CO212CL07

I could not believe it at first, but there it was, and one page even referred to X’s family, to his father, who had been an official in the navy, and there was a reference to the new captain’s handsome and manly figure; it was him.",CO212CL07
19632,89,"My first impression was pleasure; we could be alone. She would not accompany the troops south. Then, I recalled what he had told me about the war, and I thought it strange he would enlist as a volunteer, even if X’s love of generosity and cavalier spirit might explain it. Not even as a colonel, he had told me, and now he had accepted the position of captain. Then there was Maria; how could he, who loved her so much, leave her suddenly, without the strong feelings that might lead him to war?",CO212CL07

19657,114,"Over dinner, he spoke as naturally as he could, though still coldly. His face expressed even greater effort than the prior day.

I noted that Maria’s eyes were darkened; I learned later that she had wept greatly and had had a great argument with him the day before to prevent him from leaving. She had only learned of his decision from the papers, evidence that his motive was more private than patriotic.",CO212CL07
19660,117,"She did not speak at the table, and her pain could explain the silence, without any other cause for personal embarrassment.

19661,118,"At times, he wanted to laugh; to this end he said he would naturally come back a general, but he became so hard-faced after this jest that he did not try any other.

But even this was not all; he asked me to choose a gift to remember him by, a book, for example.",CO212CL07
19666,123,"I preferred his last portrait, a photograph taken at his mother’s request, wearing the uniform of a captain of volunteers. Out of pretense, I asked him to sign it; he promptly wrote: “Offered to his loyal friend Simão de Castro by the nation’s captain of the volunteers, X.” His marble face was harder then ever, his look even more grim. He twirled the hairs of his moustache, with a compulsive gesture, and we said farewell.",CO212CL07

19669,126,"This version may be correct, because he had a vanity for beauty; but the reason was complex. They also told me that Maria, on her return from Rio Grande, died in Curitiba; others say she died in Montevideo. Her daughter did not live past the age of fifteen.",CO212CL07

Now that both men have died, and there is less need for such scruples, the story can at last be sent to the printers.",CO212CL10

The other man and I used to go there, initially out of habit or boredom and, finally, out of friendship, for I became friends with the owner of the house, and he with me.

And add to that his experience of life: he had lived a great deal, and in another milieu entirely, from which he had escaped to hide himself away in that house with that young lady; I had experienced nothing and never lived with anyone. Finally—and this characteristic is crucial—there was about him a Spanish quality, a drop of the blood that flows through the pages of Calderón, a moral attitude that, without wishing to diminish him or make fun, I would compare to a Cervantes hero.",CO212CL10
19681,11,"How had they met and fallen in love? That went back a long way. Maria was already twenty-seven, and seemed quite well educated. I heard that they had first met at a masked ball in the old Teatro Provisório. She had been wearing a short skirt and dancing to the sound of a tambourine. She had admirable feet, and either they or fate caused X. to fall in love with her. I never asked about the wedding ring she wore; I know only that she had a daughter, who was at school and never came to the house; her mother would always go and see her. We treated each other with the greatest respect, and that respect included accepting their situation unquestioningly.",CO212CL10
19682,12,"When I first began visiting, I was not yet employed at the bank. I only started working there a couple of months later, but this did not interrupt our friendship. Maria would play the piano; sometimes she and her friend Raimunda would manage to drag X. along to the theater, and I would go too. Afterward, we would take tea at someone’s house, and, occasionally, if there was a full moon, we would end the night taking a cab to Botafogo.",CO212CL10
19683,13,"Barreto did not join us on those occasions; he only became a regular visitor later, but he was good company, cheerful and lively. One night, as we were leaving, he turned the conversation to the two women, and suggested that he and I try to seduce them.",CO212CL10
19684,14,"“You choose one, Simão, and I’ll choose the other.”",CO212CL10
19685,15,I shuddered and stood stock-still.,CO212CL10
19686,16,"“Or, rather, I’ve already chosen,” he went on. “I’ve chosen Raimunda. I really like her. You choose the other one.”",CO212CL10
19687,17,“Maria?”,CO212CL10
19688,18,“Who else?”,CO212CL10
19689,19,"I was so taken aback by this tempting idea that I could find no words to reject it, no words and no gestures. It all seemed to me perfectly natural and necessary. And so I agreed to choose Maria; she was only three years older than me, but old enough to teach me the ways of love. Barreto and I embarked on our conquests with ardor and tenacity.",CO212CL10
19690,20,"Barreto did not have to try very hard; his chosen one had no lover, for she had recently been jilted, with her lover going off to marry a girl from Minas. She soon allowed herself to be consoled. One day, when I was having my breakfast, Barreto came to announce that he had received a letter from her, which he showed to me.",CO212CL10
19691,21,"“So you’re a couple, then.”",CO212CL10
19692,22,“We are. What about you?”,CO212CL10
19693,23,"“No, not me.”",CO212CL10
19694,24,“So when will you be?”,CO212CL10
19695,25,“We’ll see. I’ll tell you later.”,CO212CL10
19696,26,"I felt rather annoyed. With the best will in the world, I could not bring myself to tell Maria how I felt, not that I was in love, you understand, I was merely curious.",CO212CL10
19697,27,"Whenever I saw her youthful, slender figure, all warmth and life, I was filled with a mysterious new energy; on the one hand, I had never actually been in love, and, on the other, Maria was my friend’s companion. I say this, not in order to explain my scruples, but simply so that you can understand my diffidence.",CO212CL10
19698,28,"They had been living together for some years and were devoted to each other. X. trusted me completely, telling me about his business dealings and about his past life. Despite the age difference, we were like students in the same year at college.",CO212CL10
19699,29,"Given that I was always thinking about Maria, she had probably guessed my new state of mind from my face; the fact is that, one day, when I shook her hand, I noticed that she allowed her hand to linger a little longer than usual in mine.",CO212CL10
19700,30,"Two days later, when I went to the post office, she was there buying a stamp for a letter to Bahia. Did I mention she was from Bahia? Well, she was. She spotted me first and came to speak to me. I waited while she put the stamp on her letter, then we said goodbye. At the door, as we were leaving, I was about to say something, when I saw X. standing there before us.",CO212CL10
19701,31,"“I was just sending a letter to Mama,” Maria stammered.",CO212CL10
19702,32,"She said goodbye and went home, while he and I set off in the opposite direction. X. took this opportunity to praise Maria to the skies. He did not go into any detail about how they had met, but assured me that they had both fallen equally in love with each other and would stay together forever.",CO212CL10
19703,33,"“I won’t get married now, but we live together as man and wife, and I will die at her side. My only regret is that I’m obliged to live apart from my mother. My mother knows, though,” he said, and, for a moment, he stopped walking. Then he went on: “She knows, of course, and has even alluded to it, in a very vague, remote way, but I understood.",CO212CL10
19704,34,"I don’t think she disapproves. She knows Maria is a kind, serious-minded girl, and as long as I’m happy, she wants nothing more. That’s all I would gain from marriage.”",CO212CL10
19705,35,"He said many other things, which I barely heard, for my heart was pounding furiously and my legs had turned to jelly. I could not find the right response, and any words I tried to say got stuck in my throat. After a while, he noticed this and misinterpreted my feelings, assuming that I found his confidences boring. Laughing, he remarked on this, and I told him very earnestly:",CO212CL10
19706,36,"“No, not at all, I’m very interested. After all, the people you’re talking about are worthy of great consideration and respect.”",CO212CL10
19707,37,"I think now that I was unconsciously giving in to a necessary hypocrisy. The age of passions is a confusing one, and in that situation, I cannot really identify what my feelings were or their precise causes. On the other hand, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that I was trying to drive any flicker of distrust from X.’s mind.",CO212CL10
19708,38,"And he heard my words with a look of gratitude on his face. He enfolded me in the gaze of his large, childlike eyes, and when we said goodbye, he shook my hand energetically. I think he may even have said: “Thank you.”",CO212CL10
19709,39,"I did not feel frightened when I left him, nor full of anticipated remorse. My initial reaction to what he had confided in me vanished, leaving only the story itself, and I felt curiosity bubbling up inside me. X. had spoken of Maria as a chaste wife; he had made no allusion to her physical charms, but my youth required no direct references.",CO212CL10
19710,40,"Alone in the street, I summoned up her youthful figure, her gestures, at once robust and languid, and I felt more and more excited. Once at home, I wrote her a long, rambling letter, only to tear it up half an hour later. Then I went to supper, and afterward to X.’s house.",CO212CL10
19711,41,"Dusk was coming on. He was sitting in his rocking chair, and I occupied my usual place, looking now at the room, now at the hill opposite. Maria arrived later than usual, and seemed so exhausted that she took no part in our conversation. She sat down in a chair and nodded off. Then she played the piano a little and left the room.",CO212CL10
19712,42,"“Maria woke this morning determined to collect money for the war,” X. said. “I pointed out that not everyone would necessarily share her views. Fortunately, she must have thought better of it. She gets these crazy notions sometimes . . .”",CO212CL10
19713,43,“But why shouldn’t she collect money?”,CO212CL10
19714,44,"“Because she shouldn’t! Besides, the war with Paraguay, well, I’m not saying it isn’t like other wars, but I’m really not that keen. At first I was, when López captured the Marquês de Olinda, yes, I was angry to begin with, then that feeling faded, and now, frankly, I think we would have been much better off allying ourselves with López against the Argentinians.”",CO212CL10
19715,45,“I prefer the Argentinians.”,CO212CL10
19716,46,"“Oh, I like them, too, but, in the interests of our own people, it would have been better to stick with López.”",CO212CL10

19718,48,"“Not me. I wouldn’t enlist, not even if they made me a colonel.”",CO212CL10
19719,49,"He said other things too. I didn’t respond immediately or very clearly or coherently because I had my ears cocked, listening for Maria’s footsteps. I muttered the occasional word, still listening. But that wretch of a girl didn’t come back. I imagined they had quarreled. In the end, I suggested we have a game of ombre.",CO212CL10
19720,50,"“All right,” he said.",CO212CL10
19721,51,"We went into his study. X. put the deck of cards on the table and went to call Maria. I heard a few whispered exchanges, but could only really make out the following words:",CO212CL10
19722,52,“Come on. It’s only for half an hour.”,CO212CL10
19723,53,“Do I have to? I’m really not feeling very well.”,CO212CL10
19724,54,"Maria entered the study, yawning. She said she would only play for half an hour, that she had slept badly and had a headache and was hoping to have an early night. She slumped down wearily at the table, and we began the game. I regretted having torn up my letter; I could remember a few passages, which would have explained my feelings with the necessary persuasive warmth.",CO212CL10
19725,55,"If I had kept it, I would have given it to her then, for she often came out onto the landing to say goodbye and to close the door. That would have been the perfect opportunity and a solution to my crisis.",CO212CL10
19726,56,"After a few minutes, X. got up to fetch some tobacco from a tinplate box on his desk. Maria then did something I can barely put into words. I was sitting on her left, and she suddenly raised her cards to cover her eyes, then, turning to me, she lowered the cards and opened her eyes so wide and with such passion and feeling, that I don’t know how I didn’t step right into them. It all happened very quickly.",CO212CL10
19727,57,"By the time X. returned, rolling a cigarette, Maria was carefully studying her cards, calculating their value. I must have been shaking, and yet, despite having lost the power of speech, I still managed to make my calculations too. She then calmly uttered one of the usual words of the game, “pass” or “renege.”",CO212CL10
19728,58,"We played for nearly an hour. In the end, Maria really was falling asleep, and X. himself said she had better go to bed. I said good night and went out into the hallway, where I had left my hat and cane.",CO212CL10
19729,59,"Maria was waiting at the door to the parlor for me to leave, in order to accompany me to the door and close it after me. Before I could go down the stairs, though, she put one arm about my neck, drew me to her, and pressed her lips to mine in a quick, passionate silent kiss. I felt her slip something into my hand.",CO212CL10
19730,60,"“Good night,” she said, closing the door.",CO212CL10
19731,61,"I don’t know how I remained standing. I went down the stairs, with that kiss still on my lips, my eyes on hers, and my hand instinctively clasping whatever it was she had given me. I waited until I was at a safe distance, then, in the first lit street I came to, I went straight over to a streetlamp to see what it was. It was a card from a draper’s shop, an advertisement, with these words written in pencil on the back: “Wait for me tomorrow at the Niterói ferry, at one o’clock.”",CO212CL10
19732,62,"I was in such turmoil that I have no memory of what I did during those first few minutes. My emotions were too many and too tumultuous, and had followed so close upon one another that I barely knew what to think. I walked as far as Largo de São Francisco de Paula. I reread the message on the card; I quickened my pace, then stopped again, and a couple of policemen on patrol may well have suspected that I was up to no good.",CO212CL10
19733,63,"Fortunately, despite those tumultuous feelings, I also felt hungry and went to dine at the Hotel dos Príncipes. I didn’t fall asleep until dawn and was up again at six. The morning passed as slowly as certain slow deaths. I reached the ferry at ten minutes to one, and found Maria already waiting for me, swathed in a cape and wearing a blue veil over her face. A boat was just about to leave and so we went on board.",CO212CL10
19734,64,"The sea welcomed us warmly. There were few passengers at that hour. Other boats and birds passed, and the bright sky seemed to be celebrating our first meeting. What we said was so rushed and so confused that I can only remember half a dozen words, and none of them was the name of X. or even a reference to him.",CO212CL10
19735,65,"However, we both felt that we were traitors: I was betraying my friend and she her friend and protector. However, even if we hadn’t felt like traitors, I don’t think we would have mentioned him, we had so little time for what really mattered to us. Maria seemed quite different from the woman I thought I knew as she talked about me and about her, as tenderly as was seemly in a public place, but certainly as tenderly as possible.",CO212CL10
19736,66,"We clasped each other’s hands, devoured each other with our eyes, and our hearts were doubtless beating at the same frantic pace. That at least was my impression when we parted, after the round trip to Niterói and São Domingos. I invited her to disembark at both those points, but she refused; on the way back, I suggested taking a closed cab:",CO212CL10
19737,67,"“What kind of woman do you think I am?” she asked with a modest look that quite transformed her. And so we said goodbye, having, first, arranged to meet again, and with me swearing that I would, as usual, come to see them both that night.",CO212CL10
19738,68,"Since I have not taken up my pen in order to describe my happiness, I will leave aside the most delightful part of the affair, with its meetings and letters and conversations, as well as the dreams and hopes, the infinite longings and resurgent desires. Such affairs are like almanacs, which, for all their changes, always bring us the same days and months, with their never-changing names and saints.",CO212CL10
19739,69,"Our almanac lasted only three months, with no third quarters or sunsets. Maria had many lovely qualities; she was all life, all movement. She was, as I said, from Bahia, but had been brought up in Rio Grande do Sul, in the countryside, near the frontier.",CO212CL10
19740,70,"When I asked about her first meeting with X. at the Teatro Provisório, where she had danced to the sound of a tambourine, she said it was true, that she had gone there dressed as a Spanish señorita and wearing a mask; and when I asked her to dress up like that for me, minus the mask, or simply put on a Bahian costume to dance a lundu, she spoke like someone warning of a great danger:",CO212CL10
19741,71,“It might drive you crazy.”,CO212CL10
19742,72,“X. didn’t go crazy.”,CO212CL10
19743,73,"“But he’s still not quite in his right mind,” said Maria, laughing. “I would only have to do this . . .”",CO212CL10
19744,74,"And, standing up in one quick movement, she gave a single gyration of her hips, which was enough to make my blood seethe.",CO212CL10
19745,75,"The three months soon ended, as is the way with such quarterly periods. One day, Maria failed to turn up for our rendezvous. She was usually so punctual that I felt quite dizzy with anxiety when the appointed time passed. Five, ten, fifteen minutes; then twenty, then thirty, then forty . . . I won’t say how many times I paced up and down, in the parlor, in the hallway, watching and listening, until it became clear that she would not come.",CO212CL10
19746,76,"I’ll save you a description of my despair, of how I rolled about on the floor, babbling, screaming, crying. When I grew tired, I wrote her a long letter and hoped that she would write to me as well, explaining her absence. I did not send my letter, and that night I went to their house as usual.",CO212CL10
19747,77,"Maria explained that she had failed to meet me as arranged because she was afraid of being seen and followed by someone who had been pursuing her for some time. Indeed, I had already heard about some neighbor or other who was determinedly courting her; she told me that once he had followed her right to the door of my house. I believed this and suggested a different meeting place, but she thought this unwise. It would, she felt, be best to abandon our meetings until all suspicions had died down. She would stay at home.",CO212CL10
19748,78,"At the time, I did not grasp the simple truth, namely, that her initial ardor had faded. Maria changed completely then. You cannot imagine how different that lovely creature became, for she contained both fire and ice, and could be hotter and colder than anyone I know.",CO212CL10
19749,79,"When I realized that it was all over, I decided not to go back to the house, but still I did not lose hope. For me, it was a question of mental effort. Imagination, which has the ability to make past pleasures present again, easily convinced me that it really was possible to recover those first few weeks. Five days later, I returned, feeling unable to live without her.",CO212CL10
19750,80,"X. welcomed me with his broad, childlike smile, his pure eyes, and his firm, sincere handshake; he asked why I had not been to see him. I blamed this on a slight fever and, in order to explain my still-visible unease, claimed that it had left me with a faint headache. Maria understood what lay behind this, but showed me no affection, no pity, and, when I left, she did not accompany me to the door as she used to.",CO212CL10
19751,81,"All this only increased my anguish. I considered suicide and, out of romantic symmetry, thought of taking the ferry to Niterói—the scene of our first lovers’ tryst—and jumping overboard in the middle of the bay. I did not pursue this or any other such plan.",CO212CL10
19752,82,"Chancing to meet my old friend Barreto, I immediately told him everything. I needed someone as a sounding board. I swore him to secrecy and asked him most especially not to say anything to Raimunda. That same night, she knew everything. Raimunda was an adventurous soul, fond of plans and projects.",CO212CL10
19753,83,"She did not perhaps particularly care about me or her friend, but she saw the situation as providing her with a mission, an occupation, and was determined to reconcile us; or so at least I found out later, and that is what gives rise to this document.",CO212CL10
19754,84,"She spoke to Maria several times. At first Maria denied everything, but ended up confessing, saying that she now regretted her foolishness. She doubtless used various circumlocutions and synonyms, vague, truncated phrases, sometimes mere gestures. I only know what Raimunda told me, for she summoned me to her house and recounted her efforts and was clearly very pleased with herself.",CO212CL10
19755,85,"“But don’t lose hope,” she concluded. “I told her you might kill yourself.”",CO212CL10
19756,86,“And I might.”,CO212CL10
19757,87,“But don’t do it just yet. Wait.”,CO212CL10
19758,88,"The following day I saw in the newspaper a list of the citizens who had gone to the army headquarters the previous day to sign up as volunteers to fight for their country, and on that list was X.’s name, with the rank of captain. I couldn’t believe this at first, but all the newspapers said the same thing, and one of the papers referred to X.’s family, to his father, who had been an officer in the navy, and to the new captain’s distinguished, manly figure. It was definitely him.",CO212CL10
19759,89,"My first reaction was one of pleasure; Maria and I would be left alone. She was hardly likely to become a camp follower and head south with him. Then I remembered what he had said to me once about the war, and I found it very strange that he should enlist, even though this could be explained by his love of generous acts and his innate nobility of spirit. He had told me that he wouldn’t go even if he was made a colonel, and now here he was accepting the rank of captain. And what about Maria? How could he, who loved her so much, suddenly be parted from her, when there was no strong sense of patriotism leading him off to war?",CO212CL10
19760,90,I hadn’t been to their house for three weeks. The news of his enlistment was justification enough for an immediate visit and spared me having to make any excuses.,CO212CL10
19761,91,"I had breakfast and set off. Before going in, I put on a suitably grave face. After a few minutes, X. joined me in the parlor. His grim, withdrawn expression gave the lie to his words, which attempted to be light and cheery, and he looked dreadfully pale. He held out his hand, saying:",CO212CL10
19762,92,“So you’ve come to see the captain of volunteers?”,CO212CL10
19763,93,“I’ve come to hear you tell me it’s not true.”,CO212CL10
19764,94,"“What do you mean? It is true. I don’t quite know why, maybe it was just the latest news from the front . . . Why don’t you come with me?”",CO212CL10
19765,95,“So it is true.”,CO212CL10
19766,96,“It is.”,CO212CL10
19767,97,"After a few moments of silence, I managed to speak, and my hesitation was in part sincere, because I really didn’t know quite what to say, and in part feigned, in the hope that I would convince him of my genuine concern. I said something about it being much better if he didn’t go, that he must think of his mother. X. replied that his mother heartily approved; she was, after all, the widow of a military man. He tried to smile, but his features remained stiff and stony.",CO212CL10
19768,98,"He could not bring himself to look at me, and his eyes did not rest on anything for very long. We talked very little, and then he stood up and said he had some business to deal with, but asked me to come back and see him. At the door, he said rather awkwardly:",CO212CL10

19775,105,"I was about to ask him to remember me to Maria, as was only natural and necessary, but I could not get up the courage. Downstairs, I wished I had. I reviewed our conversation, and thought how embarrassed and hesitant I must have seemed; he, on the other hand, had come across as cold and rather arrogant. There was something else too. Both when he greeted me and when we said goodbye, his handshake had not been as firm as it usually was.",CO212CL10
19776,106,"That same night, Barreto came to see me, stunned by that morning’s news and asking me what I knew. I said I knew nothing, but told him about my visit to X., about our conversation, but not my suspicions.",CO212CL10

19781,111,"“But it seems that the third time this happened, he was listening in the small room next door. Maria ran to tell Raimunda that he had changed completely, and Raimunda said she would sound him out, but I told her not to; then I read the list in the newspapers. Later, I saw him walking down the street, and, although he didn’t seem his usual serene self, he was striding out as energetically as usual.”",CO212CL10
19782,112,"I was very shaken by this news, which confirmed my own impression, but I decided nevertheless to go to supper the following evening. Barreto wanted to come, too, but I realized that he simply wanted to keep me company, and so I put him off.",CO212CL10
19783,113,"X. had said nothing to Maria. I found them both in the parlor, and I cannot recall a more uncomfortable situation. I shook them both by the hand, but avoided her eyes, as I think she avoided mine. He certainly didn’t look at either of us. He struck a match and lit a cigarette.",CO212CL10
19784,114,"Over supper, he chatted as naturally as he could, but struggled to shake off his coldness. His face looked more strained than it had the previous day. To explain his possible nervousness, he told me that he was due to embark at the end of the week and that, as the time approached, he felt less and less inclined to leave home.",CO212CL10

19786,116,"He spoke in a rather stiff, emphatic way. I noticed that Maria had dark shadows under her eyes; I found out later that she had wept profusely and, the night before, had pleaded with him not to go. She had only learned of his decision from the newspapers, which proved that his reasons went beyond mere patriotism.",CO212CL10
19787,117,"She did not speak during supper, and her grief would have been enough to explain her silence, rather than any other personal guilt. X., on the contrary, talked a great deal, chattering on about the battalions, the new officers, the likelihood of victory, and telling countless, disconnected anecdotes and rumors.",CO212CL10
19788,118,"He occasionally tried to laugh, but he looked so gloomy when he made a joke about how he would, of course, return from the war a general, that he did not attempt another. The supper ended miserably; we smoked a cigarette, and he began again to talk about the war, but, by then, the topic was exhausted. Before leaving, I invited him to come and have supper with me.",CO212CL10

19792,122,"I still believe that those words meant that his first two days at home would be reserved for his mother and for Maria; and this should have dispelled any suspicions I had about the secret reasons behind his decision. It did not. He asked me to choose a souvenir, a book, for example.",CO212CL10

Hypocritically, I asked him to sign it, which he did: “A gift from X., captain of volunteers, to his loyal friend Simão de Castro . . .” His face had grown still stonier, his gaze still grimmer. He nervously smoothed his mustache, and with that, we said goodbye.",CO212CL10
19794,124,"He embarked on the Saturday. He left Maria enough to live on whether she chose to stay in Rio, Bahia, or in Rio Grande do Sul. She chose Rio Grande and set off three weeks later, to await his return from the war. I did not see her again; she had closed her door to me, just as she had closed her face and heart.",CO212CL10
19795,125,"Before a year was out, I learned that he had died in combat, where he bore himself with more courage than skill. I heard it said that he had already lost an arm, and that his shame at being left a cripple probably lay behind his decision to hurl himself on the enemy’s weapons, like someone eager for death.",CO212CL10
19796,126,"This might be true, because he was quite vain about his handsome appearance, but the cause was doubtless more complicated than that. I also heard that Maria, on her return from Rio Grande, died in Curitiba; others said that she died in Montevideo. Her daughter was only fifteen.",CO212CL10
19797,127,"I stayed in Rio with my feelings of remorse and nostalgia, which, later, became only remorse, and have since become admiration, a particular kind of admiration, which isn’t in itself very considerable, but enough to make me feel small, for I was incapable of doing what he did. I never really knew anyone quite like X. But why persist in calling him by that letter? Let us call him by the name he was christened with, Emílio, gentle, strong, simple Emílio.",CO212CL10

19803,6,"Nobody gave a motto. The house was a simple living room, sublet by a tailor who lived off his family savings. Rua do Lavradio, 1866. It was his second time there, invited by one of the young men. You cannot imagine how the living room was and the kind of life we made in it! Imagine a county in a Bohemian country, with everything untidy and confused. Apart from the few pieces of impoverished furniture, which were the tailor’s, there were two hammocks, one straw basket, one clothes hanger, one tin-plate chest, books, hats, and shoes.",CO198CL07

19809,12,"Elisiário took off the opa, raised it with the tip of his walking stick, moving it around the living room twice with a triumphal expression on his face, and then went to hang it on a nail as the clothes hanger was full. Afterwards, he threw his hat to the ceiling, caught it with his both hands, and put it on a table.",CO198CL07

19813,16,"“I did, and a good one,” answered Elisiário, “I ate at a casa de comércio.” But why don’t you sell Chico? He’s a good looking Creole. He’s free, there’s no doubt about that and therefore he’ll understand that, if he’s sold as a slave, you’ll have to pay him his wages . . . Are two thousand réis enough? Romeu, see there in the pocket of my opa. There should be two thousand réis in there.”",CO198CL07

It isn’t possible that he was short; this deed is so sublime that no short man could be the maker of it! Confess that he was tall. Confess that he was, at least, of average height. Do you confirm it? Thank goodness! What’s his name? Guimarães? Boys, let’s inscribe this name in a bronze sign. I gather that you didn’t give him a receipt, Chico.”",CO198CL07

19818,21,"Everything he said was much funnier than if told by anybody else. I’m unable to portray the gestures, his eyes and his laughless smile – a unique smile without altering his face or showing his teeth. This one was the least friendly of all of his expressions; all the others, however, along with his speech, ideas, and in particular his fertile and jovial imagination, which deconstructed itself in sayings, jokes, epigrams, verses, descriptions, sometimes serious and almost sublime, other times familiar, almost mischievous but always original, everything in him attracted and bounded.",CO198CL07
19819,22,"He had an unkempt beard, his hair unbrushed, his forehead, which was high, had thick vertical wrinkles. When silent, he appeared to be thinking. He would turn gradually on the sofa, then stand up, sit down, and lie down again. I left him there when I left at nine o’clock in the evening. I started to be a usual guest at the house in the Rua do Lavradio but during the first days Elisiário didn’t come. I was told that he was extremely unpredictable. He had a random lifestyle.",CO198CL07
19820,23,"Sometimes he would visit every single day; then, suddenly he would be away for two or three weeks, or even longer. He taught Latin and tutored mathematics. He didn’t graduate in any subject although he studied engineering, medicine and law, and had in all faculties a reputation of a great talent albeit talent with no relevant applicability. He would be a good prose writer if he were able to write for at least twenty minutes straight; he was a poet of improvisation but did not write verses and it was his listeners who would transcribe his verses, giving him copies of it, many of which he would lose.",CO198CL07
19821,24,"He had no family, but there was a patron, Dr Lousada, surgeon of some name, who had been the recipient of great generosity by Elisiário’s father, and decided to return such generosity to Elisiário. He was daring because of a shade of self-esteem that didn’t tolerate the slightest tease. In that house, he was absolutely benevolent. Being thirty-five years old, he was by far the oldest as the next oldest young man was only twenty-one. Their relationship was familiar and resembled the one between uncles and nephews, albeit with a little less authority, a little freer.",CO198CL07
19822,25,"On the weekend, Elisiário came to the Rua do Lavradio. He had the idea of writing a drama, and wanted to dictate it. He chose me because I was a fast transcriber. This intellectual and handwritten collaboration lasted two nights and a half. An act and the first scenes of another were recorded on paper but Elisiário absolutely refused to finish the play. At first he said he would do it later, and then after that he didn’t feel like it, but kept talking about other matters. In the end, he argued the play was worthless.",CO198CL07
19823,26,"The last came as a surprise to us all as the play seemed, to us, excellent, and even today I believe it was. But its author started referring to the text and demonstrated that even the writing was worthless, even the plot wasn’t worth anything. He spoke as if it were someone else’s. We disagreed; I, particularly, thought this was a crime, and repeated this word with conviction and with fire and soul. I found it a crime not to finish the play, which was an outstanding one.",CO198CL07

19825,28,“Eighteen.”,CO198CL07

19828,31,"“It’s a good one,” he suggested with his dreamy eyes. “This one yes, I think it will be a great play. It will have five scenes or maybe I will make it in verse. The subject works . . . ”",CO198CL07
19829,32,"He never mentioned the idea again, but the play which was already partially written brought us a little closer to each other. Or maybe it was empathy, or perhaps a product of his self-esteem upon seeing that I was the one most disappointed with the interruption and disapproval of the play – or some other reason I didn’t know and wasn’t worth looking for – that made me different from the others in Elisiário’s eyes. He wanted to know who my parents were and what they did for a living.",CO198CL07
19830,33,"I told him I had no mother, that my father was a farmer in Baturité, and that I was a student who also studied verses and was considering writing a poem, a play, and a novel. I already had a list of readers for my verses. It seems like, his being in touch with the literary world, something told him about my youthful sentiments or maybe he saw something in me that revealed them. He offered to help me with my studies by teaching me Latin, French, English, history . . . Filled with pride no less than sensibility, I said words he liked to hear, and he responded in a serious tone:",CO198CL07
19831,34,“I want to make a man out of you.”,CO198CL07
19832,35,"We were alone; I didn’t say anything to the others, and I don’t know if from then on they noticed any difference in the way Elisiário related to me. The reality, however, was that there was no great change in our relationship, nor was his plan to ‘make a man’ out of me anything more than friendship and charity. He taught me some subjects when I asked him for lessons, but I rarely asked for them. I wanted to hear him, hear him, hear him forever.",CO198CL07
19833,36,"You can’t imagine the eloquence of this man, warm and strong, soft and docile, the images that blossomed in his speech, vanguard ideas, new and gracious forms. There were many times when we stayed alone on Rua do Lavradio, him speaking, me listening. Where did he live? I was told that it was somewhere in Gamboa, but he never invited me to go there, nor did anyone know, for sure, where he lived.",CO198CL07
19834,37,"We walked slowly in the street, straight and circumspect. Nothing would, therefore, make the clumsy tenant of the house in Lavradio suspect anything for, if Elisiário spoke about himself, it wouldn’t be in many words. In the first days, he would meet me with no trouble and almost out of duty he would listen to me attentively, giving no opinions or very few, whilst stretching his fingers and continuing to walk . He went everywhere and it was usual to find him in the most distant and dispersed places, in Botafogo, S. Cristovão, Andaraí. Out of the blue, he would go in a boat to Niterói. He called himself an errant.",CO198CL07
19835,38,"“I am an errant. If one day I come to an absolute state of stillness, you can be sure I am dead.”",CO198CL07
19836,39,One day I found him on Rua de S. José. I told him I was going to see the church of the Jesuits in the Castelo district as I had never been there.,CO198CL07
19837,40,"“Let’s go then,” he replied.",CO198CL07
19838,41,"We went up the hill, where we found the church open and went in. Whilst I was admiring the altar, he continued talking until the point when, in a matter of minutes, he became the centre of attention, a one-man show. It is as if everything we were seeing was reborn as it had been before. I visited the first temples of the city, the priests of the Company, their monastic and secular lives, the most prominent names and great deeds.",CO198CL07
19839,42,"When we left, we went to the monumental walls, discovering the sea and places of the city; in this way Elisiário made me relive two centuries of the past in one day only. I experienced the expedition of the French as if he had commanded or fought it. I breathed in the air of the colony, and contemplated old and dead images. His evocative imagination was the greatest gift of this man for he knew how to give life to what was extinguished and reality to those that are imagined.",CO198CL07
19840,43,"But his knowledge was not reduced to the local past or to his dreams. Do you see that icon that I have got there in the wall? You know, it is an imitation of the Venus de Milo.",CO198CL07
19841,44,"Once I went to an exhibition of paintings and I found Elisiário there, looking serious, with his great immense overcoat. He accompanied me; when we were passing by the room where sculptures were on display, I came across this replica of Venus. It was the first time I saw it. I knew it was her when I realized she had no arms.",CO198CL07
19842,45,“Oh! Admirable!” I exclaimed.,CO198CL07
19843,46,"Elisiário started interpreting the anonymous beauty with such an insight and preciseness that left me even more stunned. He told me many things about the Venus de Milo. He mentioned the positioning of her arms, their gestures, and what kind of attitude they gave to the sculpture in her gracious and natural manner.",CO198CL07
19844,47,"He spoke about aesthetics and great artists, of life in Ancient Greece, of black marble, and of the Greek. He was a Greek, an authentic Greek, who from there was able to transport me from a narrow street to the front of the Parthenon. Elisiário’s opa was now a toga, his language that of the Heliades, which I knew nothing about, neither then nor now. But that devil of a man was like a wizard.",CO198CL07
19845,48,"We left and went to the Campo da Aclamação, which wasn’t the park that it is today as there was no form of protecting it other than by nature itself through the grass that grew, and women slapped and soaped up clothes in the front of the military barracks. I was filled with Elisiário’s discourse, at his side, his head lowered and his eyes pensive. Suddenly I heard someone say in a low voice:",CO198CL07
19846,49,"“Adeus, Ioiô!”",CO198CL07
19847,50,"She was a seller of sweets, a Creole from Bahia, it seemed to me from the embroidery and pleats of her skirt and shirt. She came from Cidade Nova and was crossing the countryside. Elisiário replied to her greeting, saying:",CO198CL07
19848,51,"“Adeus, Zeferina!”",CO198CL07
19849,52,"Then he looked at me, still, laughing without a smile and, after a few seconds:",CO198CL07
19850,53,"“Do not be surprised, boy. There are many kinds of Venus. Nobody could say this one has no arms as he continued looking at her arms, darker by the contrast between the short sleeve and the white of her shirt.”",CO198CL07
19851,54,I was so embarrassed that I said nothing.,CO198CL07
19852,55,"I never mentioned this incident at Rua do Lavradio; they could cause trouble for Elisiário, and I didn’t want to cause problems. I looked upon him with some kind of individual adoration that familiarity doesn’t weaken. We had dinner sometimes, and one night we went to the theatre. It was difficult for him to be in the theatre in the same seat for a long time, squeezed between two people, with people in front of and behind him.",CO198CL07
19853,56,"When the theatre was very busy, and the orchestra seats were full, he would panic at the thought that he might not be able to leave it in the middle of an act in case of need. During the performance of that day, in the middle of the third act (the play had five) he told me he couldn’t take it any longer and decided to leave.",CO198CL07
19854,57,"We went to the nearby botequim for tea and I forgot about the theatre altogether. We stayed until the place closed. We spoke about travelling; I told him about life in the countryside of Ceará, he listened and envisioned a thousand journeys to the outback of Brazil, across mountains, fields, and rivers, by donkey and canoe. He would collect everything from plants to legends, from songs to accents. He narrated the life of the Caipira, spoke about Aeneas, cited Virgil and Camões in such ways that he impressed the servants who looked at him perplexedly.",CO198CL07
19855,58,"“Would you go, from here to S. Cristovão by foot with me?” he asked me in the street.",CO198CL07
19856,59,"“Yes, maybe.”",CO198CL07
19857,60,"”No, maybe you’re tired.” “No, I’m not, let’s go.”",CO198CL07
19858,61,"“You’re tired,” he concluded.",CO198CL07
19859,62,“See you later. Goodbye.”,CO198CL07
19860,63,"Well, I was really tired and needed to sleep. When I was on my way home, I asked myself if he was going alone, at that time in the night, and I felt like going with him from some distance, up to a certain point. He was still on Rua dos Ciganos. He walked slowly, with his walking stick below his arm and his hands behind his back, or in his trouser pockets. He crossed Campo da Aclamação, went down Rua de S. Pedro and in the direction of Aterrado",CO198CL07
19861,64,"At Campo I wanted to turn back, but curiosity gave me the strength to continue walking. Who knows if this errant would not have a place where lovers would conceal themselves? I was not happy about this thought and wanted to punish myself for it by going back; but curiosity took my sleep away and reinvigorated my legs. I went walking after Elisiário. We arrived at the bridge of the Aterrado and crossed it to Rua de S. Cristovão. Sometimes he would stop to light a cigar or even for nothing at all. The streets were absolutely empty, with the exception of one or two patrols, a tilbury, which is rare to see, in slow motion, everyplace deserted and monotonous.",CO198CL07
19862,65,"We arrived at the Igrejinha wharf. Sleeping near the docks were the boats that, during the day, took people to Saco de Alferes. It was low tide and only the quiet snore of the water was perceptible. After a few minutes, when I thought he was going to come back by the same route, he woke up the rowers of a boat who happened to be sleeping there, and asked if they could take him to the city. I don’t know how much he offered; I saw, however, that after some hesitation they accepted the offer.",CO198CL07
19863,66,"Elisiário got into the boat, which started to move immediately, the oars injuring the water, and there, in the night and in the sea, I lost sight of my teacher of Latin and tutor of mathematics. I also found myself lost, far away from the city and completely exhausted. I was at last rescued by a tilbury that was crossing Campo de S. Cristovão, looking as tired as me, but also kind and needed.",CO198CL07
19864,67,"“You didn’t want to come with me to São Cristovão the day before yesterday? You have no idea of what you missed. The night was beautiful and the stroll was extremely pleasant. When I got to the Igrejinha quay I went in a boat to Saco do Alferes. It was a good way till home still so I stayed overnight at a guest house in Campo de Sant’Ana. A dog attacked me, when I was going to Saco and two other dogs did the same in Rua de S. Diogo, but I didn’t notice any fleas at night in the guest house because I slept like a just man. And you, what did you do?”",CO198CL07
19865,68,“Me?”,CO198CL07
19866,69,"I didn’t want to lie to him in case he sensed what happened, nor did I want to confess to him that I followed him from afar, so I simply replied:",CO198CL07

19868,71,"“Justus, justa, justum.”",CO198CL07
19869,72,"We were at the house on Rua do Lavradio. Elisiário brought on the chest of his shirt a coral pin, object of great admiration and appreciation of the boys as they had never seen him with jewellery. Even greater, however, was my surprise after the boys left. Hearing that I didn’t have enough money to buy shoes, Elisiário took the coral pin from his shirt and told me to get shoes for myself.",CO198CL07
19870,73,"I refused it strongly but was forced to accept it. I didn’t sell it, nor did I pawn it; on the following day, I borrowed some money from my father’s intermediary, got some shoes, and waited for the delivery from the North so that I could return the pin to Elisiário. You should have seen how unhappy he was to receive it back!",CO198CL07
19871,74,"“But the other day, didn’t you say the pin was given to you as a gift?” I replied to his offer to keep the jewel.",CO198CL07
19872,75,"“Yes, I said so, and it’s true, but what are jewels good for? I find them more suitable on other people. You really don’t want it for yourself?”",CO198CL07
19873,76,“No sir; a present . . . ”,CO198CL07

19877,80,"“What for? So that you could come to visit me? I do not receive anyone on my birthday. I have dinner as usual with my old friend Dr Lousada, who also writes verses, sometimes, and on the other day he toasted me with a sonnet printed on blue paper… I have it at home and it isn’t bad at all.”",CO198CL07
19878,81,“Was he the one who gave you the pin then…”,CO198CL07
19879,82,"“No, it was his daughter… His sonnet has a verse very similar to one of Camões; my old Lousada knows the classics and he also is a great doctor… But the best of him is his soul…”",CO198CL07
19880,83,"They wanted to make him a congressman. I’ve heard that two of his friends, politicians, believed that Elisiário would be a great parliamentary speaker. He didn’t reject the idea altogether and asked them instead to give him some political insights; they laughed, and the project didn’t progress further. I believe he didn’t lack political views, maybe even had a surplus, but some were so contrary to others that they would never come together to form an opinion. His thoughts depended on the mood of the day, ranging from the mood of an exalted liberal to that of a royalist conservative.",CO198CL07
19881,84,"The main reason for this refusal, however, was his inability to be obedient to any party, to a superior, or to the hierarchy of a council. If he had the liberty to change the times of sessions, to one in the morning, another at night and still another one in the middle of the night, randomly, without an agenda, and with the right to discuss the rings of Saturn or the sonnets of Petrarch, then my errant Elisiário would accept the position as long as he would not have to talk or to be silent on his turn came.",CO198CL07
19882,85,"There you have the man who was photographed in 1862. Overall, he’s a good creature, very talented, an excellent speaker, a sweet and restless soul, distrustful and grumpy, with no future or past, no regrets or ambitions, in short, an errant. Except when . . . But this is too much talking without smoking a cigar…",CO198CL07
19883,86,"Would you mind? While I light the cigar, look at this portrait of our old friend, overlooking his eyes for they do not do him justice; they rather look like the eyes of a cat or an inquisitor, piercing us as if they were piercing our conscience. They were not like that, however, as they looked more inside than outside, and when they looked outside it was as if they spilled everywhere.",CO198CL07
19884,87,"One day my friend Elisiário arrived at the boardinghouse. It was already dark, around seven o’clock. I hadn’t seen him for three weeks but, as he was taking care of exams and therefore spending more time at home, I wasn’t surprised with his absence. Besides, I was also used to his inconsistent eclipses. The room was dark, and I was going out, had just put out the candle, when the tall, thin figure of Elisiário appeared at the door.",CO198CL07
19885,88,"He entered, and went straight to sit in a chair. I sat down before him and asked him where he had been. Elisiário was crying and gave me a hug. I was so scared that I wasn’t even able to speak; I hugged him back. He dried his tears with a handkerchief, which he used to bring closed in his hand, and he sighed greatly. I think he continued crying in silence because he kept drying his eyes. I, even more terrified, hoped that he would let me know what was troubling him. At last I asked:",CO198CL07
19886,89,“What is it? What happened?”,CO198CL07
19887,90,"“Tosta, I got married on Saturday.”",CO198CL07
19888,91,"Ever more perplexed, I had no time to ask him for another explanation as Elisiário continued saying that it was a marriage of gratitude, not love, a disgrace. I didn´t know what to tell him, and I even doubted him as I didn’t understand his state and pain. The image I had of Elisiário, as I later made it out, didn’t appear to me at the time with true meaning. I even thought that it was something far simpler than the marriage itself; maybe his wife was ill or even an idiot of some sort. If that was the case, who had forced him to marry an ill woman?",CO198CL07
19889,92,"“A disgrace!” he kept repeating softly to himself, “a disgrace!”",CO198CL07

19891,94,"“Do not light it, do not embarrass me, it is more appropriate to tell you of my disgrace in the dark. Listen to me. A disgrace! It is not that she doesn’t love me; it is rather the opposite, she has been dying for me for seven years now. She is twenty-five… And is a good person! A disgrace!”",CO198CL07
19892,95,"The word disgrace was the one he mentioned the most. I, so that I could hear the rest of it, almost stopped breathing. I didn’t hear much anyway because after a few loose words, he suspended our conference. I could only find out that she was the daughter of Dr. Lousada, his patron and friend, the same one who gave him the coral pin. Elisiário’s silence was sudden, and after a few moments, as if he were regretful or embarrassed, asked me not to tell anyone whatsoever about that scene he’d made with me.",CO198CL07
19893,96,“You must know me by now…”,CO198CL07
19894,97,"“Yes, I do, and that’s why I came here. I don’t know anybody else who would deserve my trust. Goodbye. I won’t tell you anything more as it is not worth it. You’re young, Tosta; if you have no vocation for marriage, then never get married, not even for gratitude or for any other kind of interest. It would be dreadful. Goodbye. I won’t tell you where I live, I live with my father in law, but don’t come looking for me.",CO198CL07
19895,98,"He hugged me and left. I was left standing at the door of the room. When I remembered that I should have taken him to the stairs on his way out, it was too late; he was already on the last set of stairs. The oil lamp wasn’t able to light the staircase properly, and his image faded slowly, close to the handrail, with his head low and his usually vast and happy overcoat now sad.",CO198CL07
19896,99,"I saw Elisiário again only ten months later. The first absence, however, was mine as I went to Ceará to spend the holidays with my father. When I came back, I was told that he had gone to Rio Grande do Sul. One day, when I was having lunch, I read in the newspapers that he had come back the previous day, so I went to meet him as quickly as I could. I found him in St. Teresa, in a small house, with a little garden that was larger than the house. Elisiário gave me a hug with surprise; we spoke about our times in the past. I asked about his verses.",CO198CL07

19898,101,"Elisiário gave me a copy of the book but he didn’t allow me to read it there. He wanted to talk about our times together. He’d lost his father-in-law, who left him something, and he was going to continue teaching and see if he could recover the impressions he once had. Where were the young lads of Rua do Lavradio? I had memory of our times together, our long and noisy nights spent laughing, reminded me of our analogous moments and, in this way, we spent two full hours talking. When I was leaving, he took me to have dinner.",CO198CL07

19903,106,“Isn’t he a good-looking young man?”,CO198CL07
19904,107,"She confirmed his opinion by modestly nodding her head. Elisiário told her that I was going to have dinner with them, and his wife left the living room.",CO198CL07
19905,108,"“She is a good person,” he told me, “dedicated and a great hostess. She seems to adore me. Since I got married my suits no longer lack buttons . . . What a pity! They were better with the missing buttons. The overcoat I had, do you remember it?”",CO198CL07

Naturally, her husband had some bursts of eloquence, as he had had before; his wife alone wasn’t enough to listen to him. Elisiário forgot about us, and she of herself, and I found in him the same old tone, as vivid and strong.",CO198CL07
19911,114,"It was his habit to conclude his speeches with silence. Was he reviewing inside of himself the words he had just recited? Did he continue the same train of thought? Did he let himself go on by the music of the words? I don’t know; I found in him the old habit of becoming silent without noticing the presence of anybody else. On occasions his woman would also fall into silence, looking at him, with an expression not of reasoning but of admiration. This happened twice. And on both occasions she even looked pretty.",CO198CL07

It wasn’t any, after all, as we started talking about other things and, at nine o’clock, he returned home. I went back to Santa Teresa a few days later.

She asked me about my opinion of him, if I thought he had a great spirit, and if he was a great poet, a great speaker, in short, if he was a great man. Her words were not precisely these but were like them. I, who admired him deeply, confirmed her feelings, and her satisfaction with my words was reward enough for whatever effort I used to my opinion the same emphasis.",CO198CL07

Shortly after Elisiário came in, with a tie around his neck, the knot at the front, shaved and well groomed. Only then I notice the difference between this Elisiário and the other. The incoherence of his gestures was now less or ready to end entirely. His agitation had disappeared.

19930,133,"I repeated my visits. I would have dinner with them sometimes. On Sundays I would only go to have lunch. D. Jacinta was lovely. You have no idea of how gracious was her speaking and walking, all revealing her manners and the depth of her thoughts. She was very gifted with her hands despite all of the Latin and History that her husband taught her. She dressed modestly and wore her hair straight, wearing no jewellery at all – it could be her pretence, but she was honest in everything she did and she seemed very natural in the way she presented herself.",CO198CL07
19931,134,"On Sundays, lunch would take place in the garden. Elisiário would already be waiting for me when I arrived, at the door, eager for my arrival. His wife would be finishing her flower decorations to adorn the table. All of this and much more would be on display, such as cards with a list of dishes and emblematic poems and names of muses for the dishes. Not all muses were allowed as they were not wealthy and we were not gluttons, thus only some muses were welcome.",CO198CL07
19932,135,"It was during lunchtime that Elisiário, in the beginning, improvised the most. He would improvise verses of ten lines – he preferred that strophe to any other; later, he decreased the number of his improvisations until only one or two remained. So D. Jacinta asked him for sonnets, which were always fourteen lines, she and I would transcribe straight away his changes to his verses, laughing:",CO198CL07
19933,136,“What do you two want that for?”,CO198CL07
19934,137,"He lost the habit, in the end, to my and his wife’s regret. His verses were great and his inspiration was easy; they didn’t have the spark they used to have. One day I asked Elisiário why he wouldn’t reprint again his book of verses, the one which had his changes. I would help read the proofs. D. Jacinta supported my offer with enthusiasm.",CO198CL07

19939,142,She held my hand with so much strength that I was concerned. Her fingers were shaking; it felt more like a girlfriend’s holding of hands. I did what I said I would do and she helped me.

19940,143,"“This time we won,” I said.",CO198CL07
19941,144,D. Jacinta grimaced and in an instant went from happiness to disappointment.,CO198CL07
19942,145,"“Elisiário is lazy. You will see how we won’t be able to finish anything. Have you noticed how he only recites verses if forced to, and only a few verses? He could write too, at least those speeches he improvises, but his speeches are also rare and regrettably short. I have offered so many times to write down whatever he wishes… I even get a paper and a pen and wait; but he laughs, changes the subject and tells me he isn’t in the mood.",CO198CL07

19944,147,"“That is for sure, but it is also true that I let him know that I am ready whenever he feels inspired, and I ask him to call me then. He never calls me. Sometimes he has got plans; I encourage him but his plans never develop. In the meanwhile, the book he published in Porto Alegre was well received and that might motivate him.”",CO198CL07

19947,150,"“We will find it, I will treat him as if he were younger than me. Our mistake was to allow him such idleness…”",CO198CL07
19948,151,"Elisiário came back with a copy of the book. He didn’t bring ink or pen; she went to bring them. We started revising; the plan was to change not only the printing errors but the text itself. The novelty of it greatly engaged our poet for nearly two hours. It is true that most of the time he was interrupted with the story of the poems and information about the people, if there were any, and there were many. A good amount of his writing was dedicated to friends and celebrities. We naturally didn’t do much. We didn’t get any further than twenty pages. Elisiário was sleepy so we postponed the work and we never again took it up.",CO198CL07
19949,152,"D. Jacinta even suggested to him that he leave the revision of the book to us. He would then see the amended text, and that would be the end of it. Elisiário refused, however, saying that he would do everything himself; we would have to wait as there was no urgency to get it finished. But as I said, we never touched the book ever again. His improvisations were ever scarcer and, as he had no patience to compose in writing, his verses became more scarce. They had no vigour now and the poet was repeating himself.",CO198CL07
19950,153,"We wanted nevertheless to suggest another book compiling whatever was out there and, before talking to him, we went as far as compiling the book. The book, however, needed to be revised. Elisiário agreed to do it but this attempt had the same result as the other. His speeches were almost nonexistent. His love for the word was dying. He spoke like any one of us now; it wasn’t even a shadow of that cascade of ideas, images, phrases that revealed that the speaker was, in fact, a poet. In the end, he wouldn’t even speak. He would welcome me without enthusiasm, though cordially. He was, after all, living a boring life.",CO198CL07
19951,154,"With a few years of marriage, D. Jacinta now had in her husband a man of order and serenity but without the inspiration or warmth of the past. She was also changing. She stopped asking him for new verses or worrying about the revision of his old ones. She became as indifferent as him. Dinners and lunches were like the ones of anyone else who didn’t care about literature. D. Jacinta wouldn’t mention the subject as it was so unpleasant to her and her husband; I did the same. When I graduated, Elisiário wrote a sonnet for me but it was extremely difficult for him and, to tell you the truth, he wasn’t by the same man as before.",CO198CL07
19952,155,"D. Jacinta’s life became, I wouldn’t say sad, but disenchanted. The reason for this wasn’t clear unless one understands the origins of the affection that led to the marriage.",CO198CL07
19953,156,"From what I was able to observe and perceive, the girl never really loved the man she married. Elisiário believed she did, and said so, because her father thought it was love like any other kind of love. The truth, however, is that what D. Jacinta felt for him was pure admiration. She had an intellectual passion for him, nothing else, and during the first years she didn’t consider marrying him. When Elisiário was in Doctor Lousada’s house, D. Jacinta lived the best moments of her life, listening to his verses, new or old – the ones he knew by heart and the ones he improvised there.",CO198CL07
19954,157,"She had a good copy of them. She was happy to hear him even if they were not considered to be verses. Elisiário, who had known her since she was a child, talked to her as if she were his younger sister. Then he realized how intelligent she was, more so than the vast majority of women, and that there was in her a great feeling for poetry and art that made her superior. The consideration he had for her was great but it was not more than that.",CO198CL07
19955,158,"Years had passed by and D. Jacinta started to think about an act of pure dedication. She knew Elisiário’s life, his idle days, his outings at night, the incoherent and random existence which threatened to make his life useless. He had no stimulus and no ambition for the future. D. Jacinta believed that Elisiário was a genius. He had many admirers but none had the living faith and silent devotion that she had in him. The project, therefore, was to marry him. Once married, she would give him the ambition he didn’t have, the stimulus, the discipline of regular, methodical and, naturally, abundant work.",CO198CL07
19956,159,"Instead of wasting time and inspiration with futile and idle things, he would create works of great potential during his productive periods, and there were many. The great poet would affirm his work to the world. In this way, it was not difficult for her to have her father’s consent without telling him of her true reasons for marrying him, otherwise she would also be telling him she was marrying without love. She told her father, therefore, that she loved him very much.",CO198CL07
19957,160,"There is a romantic dimension to her intentions, that is true; but the romance here was a product of piety, admiration and sacrifice. Maybe she had more than one man intending to marry her. D. Jacinta didn’t think about anyone until she had the generous idea of seducing the poet. And, as you know, the poet married out of obedience.",CO198CL07
19958,161,"The outcome of her marriage was the completely opposite of her expectations. The poet, instead of contributing with poetry, turned his back to it. It ended up in nothing. In the end he didn’t even read works of art. D. Jacinta grieved immensely; it was as if she lost all of her hopes and, if she didn’t, at least she learned Latin but lost that sublime language which held the ambitions of great spirits.",CO198CL07
19959,162,The conclusion she came to was even more disconcerting. She understood that her marriage took his inspiration away as it depended on his celibate life. She regretted her decision for she didn’t find joy in her marriage nor did she attain the only advantage that she saw in the marriage.,CO198CL07
19960,163,"She was a natural errant! For me, Elisiário was really an errant even if he now seemed settled. It wasn’t the orderly life that took his inspiration away. Certainly, disorder was more in accordance with him as he was agitated and solitary; but quietude and method wouldn’t destroy the poet if his poetry wasn’t, after all, mere fever of his youth… As for me, it was no more than a gentle adolescent constipation. Ask me for love and you will have it; don’t ask me for verses for I forgot them a long time ago, concluded Tosta, kissing the wife.",CO198CL07

19963,3,"Embarrassed and annoyed, Pestana answered yes, it was he. He’d just got up from the piano, and was mopping his brow with a handkerchief as he went over to the window, when the girl made him stop. It wasn’t a ball; just an intimate soirée, not many people, twenty in all, who’d come to dine with the widow Camargo, on the Rua do Areal – this was on her birthday, 5 November 1875 … What a cheery person she was, the good widow!",CO184CL04
19964,4,"She enjoyed fun and games, in spite of her sixty years, and it was the last time she enjoyed them, for she died in early 1876. What a cheery person! With what loving care she set up some dancing, right after dinner, asking Pestana to play a quadrille!",CO184CL04
19965,5,"She didn’t have to finish her request; Pestana bowed graciously, and hastened to the piano. When the quadrille was over, they’d hardly had ten minutes’ rest when the widow rushed over to Pestana again to ask a very particular favour.",CO184CL04

As soon as the first measures sounded, a new, different happiness spread through the room, the gentlemen hurried over to the ladies, and they began to shake their hips in time to the latest polka. The latest: it had been published three weeks ago, and there was no corner of the city where it was unknown. It had reached the point where it was being whistled and hummed in the streets at night.",CO184CL04
19969,9,"Sinhazinha Mota had been far from surmising that the same Pestana she’d seen at the dining table and later at the piano, in his snuff-coloured frock-coat, with long curly black hair, cautious eyes and shaven chin, was really Pestana the composer; it was a friend who’d told her as she saw him leaving the piano when the polka was done.",CO184CL04
19970,10,"Hence the admiring question. We’ve seen his answer was embarrassed and annoyed. Even so, the two girls spared him no flatteries; such they were, and so many, that the most modest of vanities would have been pleased to hear them. He greeted them with growing irritation, until, pleading a headache, he asked to be excused.",CO184CL04
19971,11,"Nobody, neither the girls nor the lady of the house, could detain him. They offered him home remedies, or a little rest; he accepted nothing, insisted on leaving and left.",CO184CL04
19972,12,"In the street he walked fast, fearful they might still call after him; he only slowed down after he’d turned the corner of the Rua Formosa. But even there his famous festive polka lay in wait. From a modest house on the right, a few yards away, came the notes of the latest tune, played on a clarinet.",CO184CL04
19973,13,"There was dancing. Pestana stopped for a few moments, thought of retracing his steps, but pressed on, quickened his step, crossed the street, and went by on the opposite side from the house with the dancing. Gradually the notes faded away, far off, and our friend went into the Rua do Aterrado, where he lived.",CO184CL04
19974,14,"When he was getting close to home, he saw two men approaching; one of them, passing right close to Pestana, began to whistle the same polka, vigorously, con brio; the other picked up on the tempo, and off down the street went the two of them, noisy and happy, while the tune’s author, in desperation, ran to take shelter at home.",CO184CL04
19975,15,"At home, he breathed easier. It was an old house, with an old staircase, and an old black servant, who came to ask if he wanted to have dinner.",CO184CL04
19976,16,"‘I don’t want a thing,’ Pestana shouted; ‘make me some coffee and go to bed.’",CO184CL04
19977,17,"He got undressed, put a nightgown on, and went to the back room. When the servant lit the gas, Pestana smiled and, in his heart, greeted some ten portraits hanging on the wall. Only one was in oils, of a priest who had educated him, taught him Latin and music, and who, according to idle tongues, was Pestana’s father.",CO184CL04
19978,18,"He certainly had left him the old house, with the old furniture, dating from the time of Pedro I. This priest had composed some motets, was mad about music, sacred or profane, and instilled the taste for it in the boy – unless he’d also transmitted it in his blood, that’s if the gossips were right. But this is something my story is not concerned with, as you’ll see.",CO184CL04
19979,19,"The other portraits were of classical composers, Cimarosa, Mozart, Beethoven, Gluck, Bach, Schumann and some three more. Some were engravings, others lithographs, all of them badly framed and of different sizes, but put there like saints in a church. The piano was the altar; the gospel for the night was open: it was a Beethoven sonata.",CO184CL04
19980,20,"The coffee came; Pestana swallowed the first cup, and sat down at the piano. He looked at Beethoven’s portrait, and began to play the sonata, oblivious to himself, absorbed, as if in a delirium, but with the greatest perfection.",CO184CL04
19981,21,"He repeated the piece; then stopped for some moments, got up and went to one of the windows. He went back to the piano; it was Mozart’s turn – he picked on a passage and played it in the same way, with his soul in another place. Haydn took him up to midnight and the second cup of coffee.",CO184CL04
19982,22,"Between midnight and one o’clock, Pestana did little more than stand at the window and stare at the stars, then go back into the room and look at the portraits. From time to time he went to the piano, and, without sitting down, played some disconnected notes, as if searching for some idea; but the idea didn’t come and he went back to lean at the window.",CO184CL04
19983,23,"The stars looked like musical notes fixed in the sky waiting for someone to loosen them; the time would come when the heavens would be empty, but then the earth would be a constellation of musical scores. No image, reverie or reflection had any echo of Sinhazinha Mota, who, however, at this moment was thinking about him as she went to sleep, he, the famous author of so many beloved polkas.",CO184CL04
19984,24,"Maybe some idea of marriage prevented her sleeping for a little while. What’s so surprising? She was nearly twenty, he nearly thirty, a good age. The girl slept to the sound of the polka, which she knew by heart, while the author of the said polka wasn’t thinking about it or her, but the old classical works, scanning the night and the heavens, begging the angels, in a last resort the devil himself. Why couldn’t he write even one of those immortal pages?",CO184CL04
19985,25,"At times, it seemed as if the dawn of an idea was going to arise from the depths of his unconscious; he ran to the piano to try it out entire, to translate it into sounds, but in vain; the idea vanished. At other moments, sitting at the piano, he let his fingers run over the keys, at random, to see if fantasias sprung from them, as they did from Mozart’s; but nothing, nothing, inspiration didn’t come and his imagination still lay sleeping.",CO184CL04
19986,26,"If by chance an idea appeared, well-defined and beautiful, it was just the echo of someone else’s music, repeated from memory, and that he’d thought he was inventing. Then, irritated, he got up, swore he would give up art and go and plant coffee or push a cart round the streets; but ten minutes later, there he was, with his eyes on Mozart and imitating him at the piano.",CO184CL04
19987,27,"Two, three, four o’clock. After four he went to bed; he was tired, despondent, dead with fatigue; he had to give lessons the next day. He didn’t sleep much; at seven he was awake. He got up and had breakfast.",CO184CL04

19994,34,‘Wait there.’,CO184CL04
19995,35,"He ran to the room with the portraits, opened the piano, sat down and spread his hands over the keyboard. He began to play something of his own, with real, immediate inspiration, a polka, a spirited polka as the advertisements say. There was no reluctance on the part of the composer; his fingers drew the notes out, linking them, shaking them about; you’d have said that the muse was composing and dancing at the same time.",CO184CL04
19996,36,"Pestana had forgotten his pupils, he’d forgotten the servant, who was waiting there with his stick and umbrella; he’d even forgotten the portraits, hanging there on the wall with their serious faces. He was simply composing, at the keyboard or on paper, without yesterday’s vain struggle, without the frustration, asking nothing of the heavens, no longer scrutinising Mozart’s eyes. No ennui – life, charm and novelty flowed out of his soul as if from a perennial fountain.",CO184CL04
19997,37,"In a short time the polka was written. He corrected a few notes when he came back for supper; but he was already humming it as he walked along, out in the street. He liked it; the blood of his paternity and his vocation flowed freely in this recent, unpublished work. Two days later, he went to take it to the publisher of other polkas of his; there must have been about thirty already. The publisher thought it was lovely.",CO184CL04
19998,38,‘It’ll be a hit.’,CO184CL04
19999,39,"The question of the title arose. Pestana, when he’d composed his first polka, in 1871, wanted to give it a poetic title, and chose this: ‘Sun-Drops’. The publisher shook his head, and said that the titles ought themselves to appeal to the popular mind, either by alluding to some event of the day – or by the charm of the words themselves. He suggested two:",CO184CL04
20000,40,‘The Law of 28 September’3 or ‘You’ll Not Get Your Way with Me.’,CO184CL04

20002,42,"‘There isn’t one, but it’ll spread like wildfire.’",CO184CL04
20003,43,"Pestana, a still-unpublished youth, refused either of the titles and kept his polka; but it was no time till he’d composed another, and the itch for publicity made him print the two with whatever titles the publisher thought attractive or appropriate. And that was how he kept on doing things over the years.",CO184CL04
20004,44,"Now, when Pestana handed over his new polka and they came to the title, the publisher said that for the last few days he’d had one in his head for the first work that came along, a really terrific title, long and with a swing to it. Here it was: ‘Hey Lady, Hang on to That Basket.’",CO184CL04
20005,45,"‘And for the next time,’ he added, ‘I’ve got another in mind.’",CO184CL04
20006,46,"The first edition sold out as soon as it was put on display. The composer’s fame was enough to make people buy; but the work itself was in keeping with the genre, original, made you want to dance and could be quickly committed to memory. In a week, it was famous. For the first few days, Pestana was truly in love with the composition, liked to hum it under his breath, stopped in the street to hear it being played in some house or other, and got annoyed when it was badly executed. From the start, the orchestras played it in the theatres, and he went to one to hear it. He got some pleasure from hearing it whistled, one night, by a figure going down the Rua do Aterrado.",CO184CL04
20007,47,"The moon hadn’t had time to wax and wane before the honeymoon was over. As at other times, and sooner still than before, the old masters in the portraits made him bleed with remorse. Irritated and fed up, Pestana took it out on the muse that had come so often to console him, the one with the roguish eyes and seductive gestures, lively and graceful.",CO184CL04
20008,48,"Then his self-aversion came back, his hatred of anyone who asked him to play the latest polka, and together with it the effort to compose something in classical taste, one page would do, but one that could be printed and bound to stand between Bach and Schumann. But all study was useless, all struggle vain.",CO184CL04
20009,49,"He plunged into the Jordan, but came back out unbaptised. Night after night he spent in this manner, confident, stubborn, sure that will-power was enough, and that once he gave up the easy music …",CO184CL04

20011,51,"But the polkas didn’t want to go that far down. They came to Pestana’s house, right into the room with the portraits, and burst in so readily that he barely had the time to compose them, have them printed, enjoy them for a few days, get fed up with them, and go back to the old wellsprings, from whence nothing flowed. He lived this way, between these two options, until he married, and even after.",CO184CL04

20018,58,"Notaries shouldn’t be so witty – or, at any rate, so unkind with it. His niece felt a final drop of balm, which cured the slight sting of envy. It was all true. A few days later, Pestana married a twenty-seven-year-old widow, a good singer and a consumptive. He received her as the spiritual bride of his genius.",CO184CL04
20019,59,"Doubtless celibacy was the cause of his sterility and his straying from the straight and narrow, he said to himself; artistically, he thought of himself as a late-night reveller – the polkas were the affairs of a habitual roué. Now, however, he would father a family of serious, profound, inspired and polished works.",CO184CL04
20020,60,"This hope came to bud in the first hours of their love, and burgeoned in the first dawn of their marriage. ‘Maria,’ stammered his soul, ‘give me what I’ve not found in nights of solitude, or in the tumult of my days.’",CO184CL04
20021,61,"Right at the beginning, to celebrate the marriage, he had the idea of composing a nocturne. He would call it ‘Ave, Maria’. Happiness, it seemed, brought him the beginnings of inspiration; not wanting to say anything to his wife before it was ready, he worked in secret. This was difficult, for Maria, who loved music as much as he did, came to play with him, or just to listen to him, hour after hour, in the portrait room.",CO184CL04
20022,62,"They even put on some weekly concerts, with three artists, friends of Pestana’s. One Sunday, however, he could no longer contain himself, and called his wife to play her a part of the nocturne; he didn’t tell her what it was nor whom it was by. Suddenly, stopping, he looked at her questioningly.",CO184CL04
20023,63,"‘Go on,’ said Maria; ‘isn’t it Chopin?’",CO184CL04
20024,64,"Pestana went pale, stared into space, repeated one or two passages and got up. Maria sat down at the piano, and after a small effort of memory played the Chopin piece. The idea and the motif were the same; Pestana had found it down some alleyway of his memory, an ancient city full of treacherous turnings. Unhappy, desperate, he left the house, and went towards the bridge on the way to São Cristóvão.",CO184CL04
20025,65,‘Why fight it?’ he said. ‘Let’s go with the polkas … Hurrah for the polka!’,CO184CL04
20026,66,"Men who passed by and heard his words stopped to look, as if he was a madman. He went on his way, delirious, tormented, an eternal shuttlecock between his ambition and his vocation … He went past the old slaughterhouse; when he got to the railway crossing gate, he had the notion to walk up the line and wait for the first train to come and crush him. The guard made him turn back. He came to his senses and went home.",CO184CL04
20027,67,"A few days later – a clear and fresh morning in May 1876 – it was six o’clock, and Pestana felt in his fingers a peculiar, well-known tremor. He got up slowly, so as not to wake Maria, who had coughed all night and was now in a deep sleep.",CO184CL04
20028,68,"He went into the portrait room, opened the piano and, as quietly as possible, brought out a polka. He had it published with a pseudonym; in the next two months he composed and published two more. Maria knew nothing of it; she went on coughing and dying, till, one night, she expired in the arms of her terrified and desperate husband.",CO184CL04
20029,69,"It was Christmas Night. Pestana’s grief was made worse by a dance in the neighbourhood where several of his best polkas were being played. The dance was bad enough; his compositions gave it an ironic, perverse air.",CO184CL04
20030,70,"He heard the steps, imagined the movements, maybe provocative, which some of his compositions led to; all this right next to the pallid corpse, a bag of bones laid out on the bed … Every hour of the night went by like this, slow or fast, wet with tears or sweat, with cheap scent or cologne, ceaselessly frolicking and cavorting, as if to the sound of a polka by a great invisible Pestana.",CO184CL04
20031,71,"Once his wife was buried, the widower had a single aim: he would abandon music after composing a requiem, which he’d have played on the first anniversary of Maria’s death. He’d choose another occupation, clerk, postman, peddler, anything to make him forget art, murderous and deaf to his pleas.",CO184CL04
20032,72,"He began the work; he employed every trick, boldness, patience, meditation, even the caprices of chance, as he’d done in the old days, when he’d imitated Mozart. He reread and studied the composer’s Requiem. Weeks and months went by. The work, which first of all went quickly, began to slow its pace. Pestana had ups and downs.",CO184CL04
20033,73,"He thought it was missing something, that it had no religious feeling, no ideas, no inspiration or method; later, his heart would lift once more and he’d be hard at work. Eight months, nine, ten, eleven, and the requiem wasn’t finished. He redoubled his efforts; forgot his teaching and his friends. He’d reworked the piece many times; but now he wanted to finish it, one way or another. Two weeks, one week, five days … The dawn of the anniversary found him still at work.",CO184CL04
20034,74,"He contented himself with a simple spoken Mass, for himself alone. It’s impossible to say if all the tears that came furtively to his eyes belonged to the husband, or if some were the composer’s. What’s certain is that he never went back to the requiem.",CO184CL04
20035,75,‘What for?’ he said to himself.,CO184CL04
20036,76,"Yet another year went by. At the beginning of 1878, the publisher came by.",CO184CL04
20037,77,"‘It’s been two years since you’ve given us one of those tunes of yours,’ he said. ‘Everyone’s asking if you’ve lost your gift. What have you been doing?’",CO184CL04
20038,78,‘Nothing.’,CO184CL04
20039,79,"‘I know you’ve had a severe blow; but it was two years since. I’ve come to propose a new contract: twenty polkas in twelve months; the old price, and a bigger percentage on the sales. Then, when the year’s up, we can renew it.’",CO184CL04
20040,80,"Pestana made a gesture of assent. He didn’t have many pupils, he’d sold the house to pay off debts, and his basic needs were eating up what was left, which wasn’t very much. He accepted the contract.",CO184CL04
20041,81,"‘But the first polka must come straight away,’ the publisher explained. ‘It’s urgent. Have you seen the Emperor’s letter to Caxias? The liberals have been called on to form a government; they’re going to undertake electoral reform. The polka will be called “Hurrah for Direct Elections!” It’s not a political statement; just a good topical title.’",CO184CL04
20042,82,"Pestana composed the first work for the contract. In spite of the long silence, he hadn’t lost his originality or his inspiration. He still had the same touch of genius. The other polkas came, in regular succession.",CO184CL04
20043,83,"He’d kept the portraits and their works; but he avoided spending every night at the piano, so as not to get caught up in more failed attempts. Now he asked for a free ticket whenever there was a good opera or solo concert; he went and sat in a corner, enjoying all these things which would never sprout from his brain.",CO184CL04
20044,84,"Once or twice, when he came back home, his head full of music, the unpublished maestro woke again; then, he’d sit down at the piano, and, with no real aim, play a few passages until he went to bed twenty or thirty minutes later.",CO184CL04
20045,85,"So the years went by, until 1885. Pestana’s fame had given him the undisputed first place among polka composers; but the chief place in the village wasn’t enough for this Caesar, who would still have preferred not the second, but the hundredth place in Rome. He still had the mood swings he’d had before about his compositions; the difference was they were less violent now. There was no enthusiasm in the first hours following a new composition, nor was there the horror after the first week; a bit of pleasure and a certain ennui were all.",CO184CL04
20046,86,"That year, he picked up a slight fever, which worsened in a few days, and became pernicious. He was already in danger when the publisher appeared; he knew nothing of the illness, and was coming to give him the news of the conservatives’ return to power, and to ask him for a topical polka.",CO184CL04
20047,87,"The nurse, an impoverished clarinet player in a theatre band, told him of Pestana’s state, so the publisher thought it better to remain silent. It was the sick man who insisted he should tell him what he’d come for; the publisher obeyed.",CO184CL04
20048,88,"‘But only when you’re completely better,’ he concluded.",CO184CL04
20049,89,"‘As soon as the fever’s gone down a bit,’ said Pestana.",CO184CL04
20050,90,There was a pause for a few seconds. The clarinettist went on tiptoe to prepare his medicine; the publisher got up and took his leave.,CO184CL04
20051,91,‘Goodbye.’,CO184CL04
20052,92,"‘Look,’ said Pestana, ‘as it’s probable I’ll be dying in the next few days, I’ll do you two polkas; the other’ll serve when the liberals come back again.’",CO184CL04
20053,93,"It was the only joke he’d ever cracked in his life, and it was just in time, because he died early the next morning, at five past four, at peace with his fellow men and at war with himself.",CO184CL04

20055,2,"“OH! SO YOU’RE PESTANA? said Sinhazinha Mota, raising her hands in surprise and admiration. And then, correcting her over-familiar tone, she quickly followed this up with: “You must forgive me for being so forward, but . . . is it really you?”",CO184CL12
20056,3,"Embarrassed and annoyed, Pestana replied that yes, it was indeed him. He had just left the piano, mopping his brow with his handkerchief, and had nearly reached the window, when the young lady stopped him. It was not a ball, just an intimate gathering for a handful of guests, no more than twenty, all told, who had come to dine with the Widow Camargo at Rua do Areal on the occasion of her birthday, November 5, 1875. Such a kind and cheerful widow!",CO184CL12
20057,4,"She loved to laugh and have fun, even though she had just reached the fine old age of sixty; indeed this turned out to be the last time she did laugh and have fun, for she died during the first few days of 1876. Yes, such a kind and cheerful widow! Such spirit and enthusiasm: no sooner had they finished dinner than she launched into organizing the dances, asking Pestana to play a quadrille!",CO184CL12
20058,5,"She scarcely needed to finish her request, for Pestana bowed graciously and hastened to the piano. After the quadrille, she gave him barely time to draw breath before she bustled over once again to ask a very particular favor.",CO184CL12
20059,6,"“Just say the word, madam.”",CO184CL12
20060,7,"“Would you play that polka of yours, Keep Your Hands to Yourself, Mister?”",CO184CL12
20061,8,"Pestana grimaced, then, quickly disguising his displeasure, gave a stiff, silent bow, and returned, unenthusiastically, to the piano. On hearing the first few bars, a new wave of gaiety swept the room, the gentlemen rushed over to the ladies, and the pairs launched furiously into the latest polka. It was absolutely the latest thing, for it had been published only a couple of weeks earlier and there was hardly a corner of the city where it had not been heard. It had even attained that highest of accolades, being whistled and hummed in the streets at night.",CO184CL12
20062,9,"Sinhazinha Mota had not for one moment thought that the Pestana she had seen at the dining table and then at the piano, with his snuff-brown frock coat and long black curly hair, his somewhat wary eyes and smoothly shaven chin, could possibly be the composer Pestana; a friend had only told her this when Pestana got up from the piano after finishing the polka.",CO184CL12
20063,10,"Hence her admiring question. As we have seen, he responded with some embarrassment and annoyance. Unperturbed, Sinhazinha Mota and her friend heaped so many extravagant compliments upon him that even the most humble of vanities would have been pleased. Pestana, however, received their words with growing annoyance until, pleading a terrible headache, he asked to be excused.",CO184CL12
20064,11,"Neither the young ladies nor his hostess could persuade him to stay. He was offered homemade remedies and a little rest, but would have none of it; he insisted on leaving, and he left.",CO184CL12
20065,12,"Out in the street, he walked quickly away, afraid they might still call him back; he only slowed down once he had turned the corner of Rua Formosa. But there, too, his polka awaited him in all its jollity. From a smallish house on the right-hand side, only a few yards away, came the notes of his latest composition, played on a clarinet.",CO184CL12
20066,13,"There was the sound of dancing, too. Pestana paused for a few moments, considered turning back, but carried on walking, quickening his pace and crossing to the other side of the street. The notes faded into the distance, and Pestana turned into Rua do Aterrado, where he lived.",CO184CL12
20067,14,"As he reached his house, he saw two men coming toward him. One of them, almost brushing past Pestana, started whistling the same polka, con brio; the other man joined in and the two of them headed noisily and cheerily off down the street, while the tune’s composer ran despairingly into his house.",CO184CL12
20068,15,"Once inside, he breathed again. His old house, his old staircase, his old black manservant, who came to inquire whether he wanted any supper.",CO184CL12
20069,16,"“No, no supper,” Pestana bawled at him. “Just make me some coffee and go to bed.”",CO184CL12
20070,17,"He got undressed, put on a nightshirt, and went to the room at the back of the house. When the servant lit the gas lamp in the room, Pestana smiled and nodded his heartfelt greetings to the ten or so portraits hanging on the wall. Only one was an oil painting; it was a portrait of the priest who had raised him, taught him Latin and music, and who, if you believed idle gossip, was Pestana’s father.",CO184CL12
20071,18,"He had certainly left him as an inheritance this old house, along with its bits and pieces of antique furniture, some dating from the reign of Pedro I. The priest had himself composed a couple of motets; he was mad about music, both sacred and profane, and this passion he instilled in the boy, or perhaps transmitted to him by blood, if those wagging tongues were right. However, as you will see, my story does not concern itself with such matters.",CO184CL12
20072,19,"The other portraits were of classical composers: Cimarosa, Mozart, Beethoven, Gluck, Bach, Schumann, and three more; some of them were engravings, others lithographs, all badly framed and of differing sizes, but arranged on the wall like saints in a church. The piano was the altar and upon it lay open the evening gospel: a Beethoven sonata.",CO184CL12
20073,20,"The coffee arrived; Pestana gulped down the first cup and went over to the piano. He looked up at the portrait of Beethoven and began to play the sonata, as if caught up in a kind of wild ecstasy, but with absolute perfection.",CO184CL12
20074,21,"He repeated the piece, then paused, stood up, and went to one of the windows. Then he returned to the piano; now it was Mozart’s turn. He picked up a sheet of music and performed it in the same manner, his soul transported to another place. Haydn took him up to midnight and his second cup of coffee.",CO184CL12
20075,22,"Between midnight and one o’clock, Pestana did little except stand at the window and gaze at the stars, or back at the portraits in the room. From time to time he went to the piano and, without sitting down, played a few random chords, as if searching for a thought. But the thought did not appear and he returned to the window.",CO184CL12
20076,23,"To him the stars resembled a host of musical notes fixed in the night sky waiting for someone to reach out and unstick them; a time would come when the sky would be empty, and the Earth would be a constellation of musical scores. Nothing, no image, no reverie or reflection reminded him of Sinhazinha Mota, who, at that very moment, was drifting off to sleep thinking about him, that famous composer of so many well-loved polkas.",CO184CL12
20077,24,"Perhaps the idea of marriage deprived that young lady of several moments of sleep? And why shouldn’t it? She was about to turn twenty, and he was thirty, a good age. The young lady fell asleep to the sound of the polka, which she knew by heart, whereas its composer was thinking of neither the polka nor of her, but of the great classics of old, while he endlessly quizzed the heavens and the night, asking the angels and, as a last resort, the devil himself. Why could he not write just one of those immortal pages?",CO184CL12
20078,25,"At times, the dawn of an idea seemed to rise up from the depths of his unconscious, and he would run to the piano in order to set it down whole, translate it into sounds, but in vain; the idea vanished. At other times, sitting at the piano, he would let his fingers run wild, to see what fantasias blossomed from them, as they had from Mozart’s hands. But nothing, absolutely nothing; inspiration failed him, his imagination slumbered.",CO184CL12
20079,26,"If by any chance an idea did appear, fully formed and beautiful, it was merely the echo of another piece repeated from his memory, and which he thought he had invented. Then he would leap angrily to his feet and swear that he would give up his art, go and plant coffee or push a cart around the streets. But ten minutes later there he would be once again at the piano, with his eyes fixed on Mozart, trying to mimic his genius.",CO184CL12
20080,27,"Two, three, four o’clock. Sometime after four he went to bed; he was weary, disheartened, dead with fatigue; he had to give lessons the following day. He only slept a little, awoke at seven, got dressed, and ate breakfast.",CO184CL12
20081,28,"“Would Sir like the cane or the umbrella?” the servant asked, following orders, for his master was often distracted.",CO184CL12
20082,29,“The cane.”,CO184CL12
20083,30,"“But it looks like rain today, sir.”",CO184CL12
20084,31,"“Rain,” Pestana repeated mechanically.",CO184CL12
20085,32,"“Yes, sir. Seems so. The sky’s quite dark.”",CO184CL12
20086,33,"Pestana looked at the servant vaguely, his mind elsewhere. Suddenly:",CO184CL12
20087,34,“Wait right there.”,CO184CL12
20088,35,"He ran to the room with the portraits, opened the piano, sat down, and spread his hands over the keyboard. He began to play something of his own making, a real and spontaneous inspiration, a polka, a rambunctious polka, as the papers would say. The composer did not hold back: his fingers plucked the notes from the air, entwining them, shaping them; you could say his muse was simultaneously composing and dancing.",CO184CL12
20089,36,"Pestana forgot all about his lessons, his servant waiting for him with the cane and the umbrella, forgot even the portraits hanging gravely on the wall. He simply composed, at the keyboard or on paper, with none of the previous evening’s vain efforts, no frustration, asking nothing of heaven or of Mozart’s impassive eyes. No weariness at all. Life, wit, and novelty gushed from his soul like an unquenchable stream.",CO184CL12
20090,37,"Soon the polka was finished. He made a few minor changes when he returned for dinner, but already he was humming the tune as he walked down the street. He liked it; the blood of his father and his musical vocation flowed through this new and original composition. Two days later, he took it to the publisher of his other polkas, of which there were already over thirty. The editor thought it delightful.",CO184CL12
20091,38,“It will be a huge success.”,CO184CL12
20092,39,"The matter of a title arose. When Pestana composed his first polka, in 1871, he had wanted to give it a poetical title; his choice was “Drops of Sunshine.” The publisher shook his head and told him that titles must themselves be destined for popular tastes, either by allusion to some current event or some catchy expression. He suggested two:",CO184CL12
20093,40,"“The Law of September 28,” or “Fine Words Butter No Parsnips.”",CO184CL12
20094,41,“But what does ‘Fine Words Butter No Parsnips’ mean?” asked the composer.,CO184CL12
20095,42,"“Oh, it means nothing at all, but soon enough it’ll be all the rage.”",CO184CL12
20096,43,"Still new to the ways of the world, Pestana refused both titles and kept his polka, but it was not long before he composed another, and the itch of publicity led him to have both of them published, with whatever titles the publisher considered most attractive or appropriate. And thus the pattern was set.",CO184CL12
20097,44,"Now, when the composer delivered his brand-new polka and they came to discussing the title, the publisher remembered that, for quite some time, he had been keeping one aside for the next tune Pestana brought him. It was intriguing and expansive, yet jaunty: “Hey Missus, Hang On to Your Hamper.”",CO184CL12
20098,45,"“And I’ve already thought up another good one for next time,” he added.",CO184CL12
20099,46,"The first edition sold out as soon as it appeared. The composer’s fame was enough to guarantee sales, and in itself the tune was well suited to the genre, being original, danceable, and easily learned by heart. Within one week it was famous. For the first few days Pestana was truly in love with his new creation; he enjoyed humming it to himself, would stop in the street to listen to it being played in some house, and get annoyed when it was played badly. Soon the theater orchestras were playing it, and he even went to one of the performances. Nor was he displeased to hear it whistled, one night, by a shadowy figure coming down Rua do Aterrado.",CO184CL12
20100,47,"The honeymoon lasted only a quarter moon. As on previous occasions, and even more quickly than before, the old masters in the portraits made him bleed with remorse. Angry and ashamed, Pestana raged against the muse who had so often consoled him, she with her impish eyes and warm embraces, so easygoing and so gracious.",CO184CL12
20101,48,"Back came his self-disgust and his loathing of anyone who asked him to play his latest polka, and he resumed his efforts to compose something along classical lines, even if it was only a page, just one, but one that would deserve to be bound between those of Bach and Schumann. A futile enterprise, a vain effort.",CO184CL12

20104,51,"But the polkas did not want to go quite that far. They came to Pestana’s house, to the very room where the portraits hung, bursting in so profusely that he scarcely had time to set them down, have them published, enjoy them for a few days, get bored with them, and return to the same old wellsprings whence nothing flowed. And thus his life swung between those two extremes until he married, and after he married too.",CO184CL12

20111,58,"Notaries should not attempt wit, or at least not the caustic sort. At this last piece of news, his niece felt a drop of soothing balm, which cured her twinge of envy. It was all true. A few days later, Pestana married a widow age twenty-seven, a fine singer and a consumptive. She would be the spiritual wife of his creative genius.",CO184CL12
20112,59,"Celibacy was doubtless the cause of his sterile, errant ways, he told himself; artistically he considered himself a wandering outcast of the dead of night; his polkas were merely his foppish fancies. Now, finally, he was going to beget a whole family of works that were serious, profound, inspired, and finely polished.",CO184CL12
20113,60,"Such hopes had budded in the very first hours of love, and blossomed at the first dawn of married life. “Maria,” his soul stammered, “give me what I could find neither in the solitude of night, nor in the turmoil of day.”",CO184CL12
20114,61,"Straightaway, to celebrate their union, he had the idea of composing a nocturne. He would call it Ave Maria. It was as though happiness brought with it the beginnings of inspiration; not wanting to say anything to his wife before it was ready, he worked in secret, which was difficult, since Maria, also a fervent music lover, would come and play with him, or simply listen, for hours and hours, in the room with the portraits.",CO184CL12
20115,62,"They even put on a few weekly concerts, with three of Pestana’s musician friends. One Sunday, however, he could contain himself no longer and called his wife into the room to play her a passage from the nocturne; he did not tell her what it was, nor who it was by. Suddenly, stopping, he looked at her inquiringly.",CO184CL12
20116,63,"“Don’t stop,” said Maria. “It’s Chopin, isn’t it?”",CO184CL12
20117,64,"Pestana went pale, stared into space, repeated one or two passages, and stood up. Maria sat down at the piano, and, struggling slightly to remember, played the piece by Chopin. The idea and the motif were the same; Pestana had discovered them in some dark alleyway of his memory, that perfidious old city. Sad and despairing, he left the house and headed toward the bridge, in the direction of São Cristóvão.",CO184CL12
20118,65,“Why struggle?” he asked himself. “I’ll stick to polkas . . . Long live the polka!”,CO184CL12
20119,66,"Passersby hearing this stared at him as if he were mad. He carried on walking, delirious, tormented, an eternal shuttlecock between his ambition and his vocation. He passed the old slaughterhouse; when he came to the railroad crossing, he had the notion of walking up the tracks and waiting for the first train to come and crush him. The guard made him turn back. He came to his senses and went home.",CO184CL12
20120,67,"A few days later—a clear, fresh morning in May 1876—at six o’clock in the morning, Pestana felt a familiar tingling in his fingers. He slipped slowly out of bed so as not to wake Maria, who had been coughing all night and was now sound asleep.",CO184CL12
20121,68,"He went to the room with the portraits, opened the lid of the piano, and, as quietly as he could, knocked out a polka. He had it published under a pseudonym; in the following two months he composed and published two more. Maria knew nothing about it; she carried on coughing and dying, until one night she passed away in the arms of her distraught and despairing husband.",CO184CL12
20122,69,"It was Christmas Eve. Pestana’s suffering was only made worse by the sounds of a dance nearby, where several of his best polkas were being played. The dancing was bad enough; hearing his own compositions gave it all a perverse air of irony.",CO184CL12
20123,70,"He heard the rhythm of the footsteps and imagined the accidentally salacious movements of the dancers, movements that some of his compositions quite frankly called out for; all this as he sat by her pale corpse, mere skin and bones, laid out on the bed. Every hour of the long night passed like that, fast or slow, moistened by tears and sweat, by eau de cologne and Labarraque’s disinfectant, springing ceaselessly back and forth as if to the sound of a polka written by the great invisible Pestana.",CO184CL12
20124,71,"After the burial, the widower had only one goal: to abandon his music forever once he had composed a Requiem, which he would perform on the first anniversary of Maria’s death. Then he would take up some other job: clerk, postman, street peddler, anything that would make him forget his murderous art, so deaf to his aspirations.",CO184CL12
20125,72,"He began the great work. He put everything into it: boldness, patience, thought, and even the occasional flight of fancy, as he had done in times gone by, imitating Mozart, whose Requiem he reread and studied. Weeks and months went by. The work, which at first went quickly, slowed its pace. Pestana had his good days and bad.",CO184CL12
20126,73,"At times he found the music lacking in some way, a sacred soul, ideas, inspiration, or method; at other times his spirits rose and he worked frantically. Eight, nine, ten, eleven months, and the Requiem was still not finished. He redoubled his efforts, neglected his teaching and his friends. He had reworked the piece many times, but now he wanted to finish it, no matter what. Two weeks, one week, five days to go . . . The anniversary dawned and he was still working on it.",CO184CL12
20127,74,"He had to make do with a simple spoken mass, for him alone. It is hard to say whether all the tears that came stealthily to his eyes were those of the husband, or if some were the composer’s. In any event, he never looked at the Requiem again.",CO184CL12
20128,75,“What for?” he asked himself.,CO184CL12
20129,76,"Another year passed. At the beginning of 1878, the publisher came to see him.",CO184CL12
20130,77,"“It’s been two years,” he said, “since you’ve given us one of your lively tunes. Everyone is wondering if you have lost your talent. What have you been doing with yourself?”",CO184CL12
20131,78,“Nothing.”,CO184CL12
20132,79,"“I know what a blow your wife’s death must have been, but it’s been two years now. I’m here to offer you a contract: twenty polkas over the next twelve months; the usual fee, and a higher percentage of the sales. And at the end of the year, we can renew it.”",CO184CL12
20133,80,"Pestana nodded his agreement. He was giving very few lessons, had sold the house to pay off debts, and daily necessities were eating up what little remained. He accepted the contract.",CO184CL12
20134,81,"“But I need the first polka straightaway,” explained the publisher. “It’s urgent. Did you hear that the Emperor has dismissed the Duke of Caxias? The liberals have been summoned to form a government; they’re going ahead with electoral reform. The polka will be called ‘Hurrah for Direct Elections!’ It’s not political, just a good title for the occasion.”",CO184CL12
20135,82,"Pestana composed the first piece for the contract. Despite his lengthy silence, he had lost neither his originality nor his inspiration. It had the same touch of genius. The other polkas followed one by one at regular intervals.",CO184CL12
20136,83,"He had kept the portraits and their subjects’ repertoire, but he avoided spending all his nights at the piano, so as not to fall into new temptations. Now he would always ask for a free ticket whenever there was a good opera or recital on; he would sit in a corner and simply savor the sounds that would never again blossom in his own mind.",CO184CL12
20137,84,"From time to time, on returning home, his head filled with music, the unsung maestro in him would awaken once again; he would sit at the piano and aimlessly play a few notes, then, twenty or thirty minutes later, go to bed.",CO184CL12
20138,85,"And so the years passed, until 1885. Pestana’s fame made him the undisputed master of the polka, but first place in such a village did not suffice for this Caesar, who would still have preferred not the second, but the hundredth place in Rome. He had the same mood swings regarding his compositions as before, the difference being that now they were less violent. No more wild enthusiasm during the first few hours, nor revulsion after the first week; just a degree of pleasure followed by a certain ennui.",CO184CL12
20139,86,"That year, he caught a slight fever. After a few days, the fever rose, and became life-threatening. He was already in grave danger when the publisher appeared, unaware that Pestana was ill; he had come to give him the news that the conservatives were back in power, and to ask him to write a polka for the occasion.",CO184CL12
20140,87,"The nurse, an impoverished theater clarinetist, informed him of Pestana’s condition, and the publisher realized it was best to say nothing. It was the patient himself who insisted that he tell him what he had come for; the publisher obeyed.",CO184CL12
20141,88,"“But only once you’re fully recovered,” he concluded.",CO184CL12
20142,89,"“Just as soon as the fever subsides a little,” said Pestana.",CO184CL12

20149,3,"Embarrassed and annoyed, Pestana replied that yes, it was indeed him. He had just left the piano, mopping his brow with his handkerchief, and had nearly reached the window, when the young lady stopped him. It was not a ball, just an intimate gathering for a handful of guests, no more than twenty, all told, who had come to dine with the Widow Camargo at Rua do Areal on the occasion of her birthday, November 5, 1875. Such a kind and cheerful widow!",CO184CL10
20150,4,"She loved to laugh and have fun, even though she had just reached the fine old age of sixty; indeed this turned out to be the last time she did laugh and have fun, for she died during the first few days of 1876. Yes, such a kind and cheerful widow! Such spirit and enthusiasm: no sooner had they finished dinner than she launched into organizing the dances, asking Pestana to play a quadrille!",CO184CL10
20151,5,"She scarcely needed to finish her request, for Pestana bowed graciously and hastened to the piano. After the quadrille, she gave him barely time to draw breath before she bustled over once again to ask a very particular favor.",CO184CL10
20152,6,"“Just say the word, madam.”",CO184CL10
20153,7,"“Would you play that polka of yours, Keep Your Hands to Yourself, Mister?”",CO184CL10
20154,8,"Pestana grimaced, then, quickly disguising his displeasure, gave a stiff, silent bow, and returned, unenthusiastically, to the piano. On hearing the first few bars, a new wave of gaiety swept the room, the gentlemen rushed over to the ladies, and the pairs launched furiously into the latest polka. It was absolutely the latest thing, for it had been published only a couple of weeks earlier and there was hardly a corner of the city where it had not been heard. It had even attained that highest of accolades, being whistled and hummed in the streets at night.",CO184CL10
20155,9,"Sinhazinha Mota had not for one moment thought that the Pestana she had seen at the dining table and then at the piano, with his snuff-brown frock coat and long black curly hair, his somewhat wary eyes and smoothly shaven chin, could possibly be the composer Pestana; a friend had only told her this when Pestana got up from the piano after finishing the polka.",CO184CL10
20156,10,"Hence her admiring question. As we have seen, he responded with some embarrassment and annoyance. Unperturbed, Sinhazinha Mota and her friend heaped so many extravagant compliments upon him that even the most humble of vanities would have been pleased. Pestana, however, received their words with growing annoyance until, pleading a terrible headache, he asked to be excused.",CO184CL10
20157,11,"Neither the young ladies nor his hostess could persuade him to stay. He was offered homemade remedies and a little rest, but would have none of it; he insisted on leaving, and he left.",CO184CL10
20158,12,"Out in the street, he walked quickly away, afraid they might still call him back; he only slowed down once he had turned the corner of Rua Formosa. But there, too, his polka awaited him in all its jollity. From a smallish house on the right-hand side, only a few yards away, came the notes of his latest composition, played on a clarinet.",CO184CL10
20159,13,"There was the sound of dancing, too. Pestana paused for a few moments, considered turning back, but carried on walking, quickening his pace and crossing to the other side of the street. The notes faded into the distance, and Pestana turned into Rua do Aterrado, where he lived.",CO184CL10
20160,14,"As he reached his house, he saw two men coming toward him. One of them, almost brushing past Pestana, started whistling the same polka, con brio; the other man joined in and the two of them headed noisily and cheerily off down the street, while the tune’s composer ran despairingly into his house.",CO184CL10
20161,15,"Once inside, he breathed again. His old house, his old staircase, his old black manservant, who came to inquire whether he wanted any supper.",CO184CL10
20162,16,"“No, no supper,” Pestana bawled at him. “Just make me some coffee and go to bed.”",CO184CL10
20163,17,"He got undressed, put on a nightshirt, and went to the room at the back of the house. When the servant lit the gas lamp in the room, Pestana smiled and nodded his heartfelt greetings to the ten or so portraits hanging on the wall. Only one was an oil painting; it was a portrait of the priest who had raised him, taught him Latin and music, and who, if you believed idle gossip, was Pestana’s father.",CO184CL10
20164,18,"He had certainly left him as an inheritance this old house, along with its bits and pieces of antique furniture, some dating from the reign of Pedro I. The priest had himself composed a couple of motets; he was mad about music, both sacred and profane, and this passion he instilled in the boy, or perhaps transmitted to him by blood, if those wagging tongues were right. However, as you will see, my story does not concern itself with such matters.",CO184CL10
20165,19,"The other portraits were of classical composers: Cimarosa, Mozart, Beethoven, Gluck, Bach, Schumann, and three more; some of them were engravings, others lithographs, all badly framed and of differing sizes, but arranged on the wall like saints in a church. The piano was the altar and upon it lay open the evening gospel: a Beethoven sonata.",CO184CL10
20166,20,"The coffee arrived; Pestana gulped down the first cup and went over to the piano. He looked up at the portrait of Beethoven and began to play the sonata, as if caught up in a kind of wild ecstasy, but with absolute perfection.",CO184CL10
20167,21,"He repeated the piece, then paused, stood up, and went to one of the windows. Then he returned to the piano; now it was Mozart’s turn. He picked up a sheet of music and performed it in the same manner, his soul transported to another place. Haydn took him up to midnight and his second cup of coffee.",CO184CL10
20168,22,"Between midnight and one o’clock, Pestana did little except stand at the window and gaze at the stars, or back at the portraits in the room. From time to time he went to the piano and, without sitting down, played a few random chords, as if searching for a thought. But the thought did not appear and he returned to the window.",CO184CL10
20169,23,"To him the stars resembled a host of musical notes fixed in the night sky waiting for someone to reach out and unstick them; a time would come when the sky would be empty, and the Earth would be a constellation of musical scores. Nothing, no image, no reverie or reflection reminded him of Sinhazinha Mota, who, at that very moment, was drifting off to sleep thinking about him, that famous composer of so many well-loved polkas.",CO184CL10
20170,24,"Perhaps the idea of marriage deprived that young lady of several moments of sleep? And why shouldn’t it? She was about to turn twenty, and he was thirty, a good age. The young lady fell asleep to the sound of the polka, which she knew by heart, whereas its composer was thinking of neither the polka nor of her, but of the great classics of old, while he endlessly quizzed the heavens and the night, asking the angels and, as a last resort, the devil himself. Why could he not write just one of those immortal pages?",CO184CL10
20171,25,"At times, the dawn of an idea seemed to rise up from the depths of his unconscious, and he would run to the piano in order to set it down whole, translate it into sounds, but in vain; the idea vanished. At other times, sitting at the piano, he would let his fingers run wild, to see what fantasias blossomed from them, as they had from Mozart’s hands. But nothing, absolutely nothing; inspiration failed him, his imagination slumbered.",CO184CL10
20172,26,"If by any chance an idea did appear, fully formed and beautiful, it was merely the echo of another piece repeated from his memory, and which he thought he had invented. Then he would leap angrily to his feet and swear that he would give up his art, go and plant coffee or push a cart around the streets. But ten minutes later there he would be once again at the piano, with his eyes fixed on Mozart, trying to mimic his genius.",CO184CL10
20173,27,"Two, three, four o’clock. Sometime after four he went to bed; he was weary, disheartened, dead with fatigue; he had to give lessons the following day. He only slept a little, awoke at seven, got dressed, and ate breakfast.",CO184CL10
20174,28,"“Would Sir like the cane or the umbrella?” the servant asked, following orders, for his master was often distracted.",CO184CL10
20175,29,“The cane.”,CO184CL10
20176,30,"“But it looks like rain today, sir.”",CO184CL10
20177,31,"“Rain,” Pestana repeated mechanically.",CO184CL10
20178,32,"“Yes, sir. Seems so. The sky’s quite dark.”",CO184CL10
20179,33,"Pestana looked at the servant vaguely, his mind elsewhere. Suddenly:",CO184CL10
20180,34,“Wait right there.”,CO184CL10
20181,35,"He ran to the room with the portraits, opened the piano, sat down, and spread his hands over the keyboard. He began to play something of his own making, a real and spontaneous inspiration, a polka, a rambunctious polka, as the papers would say. The composer did not hold back: his fingers plucked the notes from the air, entwining them, shaping them; you could say his muse was simultaneously composing and dancing.",CO184CL10
20182,36,"Pestana forgot all about his lessons, his servant waiting for him with the cane and the umbrella, forgot even the portraits hanging gravely on the wall. He simply composed, at the keyboard or on paper, with none of the previous evening’s vain efforts, no frustration, asking nothing of heaven or of Mozart’s impassive eyes. No weariness at all. Life, wit, and novelty gushed from his soul like an unquenchable stream.",CO184CL10
20183,37,"Soon the polka was finished. He made a few minor changes when he returned for dinner, but already he was humming the tune as he walked down the street. He liked it; the blood of his father and his musical vocation flowed through this new and original composition. Two days later, he took it to the publisher of his other polkas, of which there were already over thirty. The editor thought it delightful.",CO184CL10
20184,38,“It will be a huge success.”,CO184CL10
20185,39,"The matter of a title arose. When Pestana composed his first polka, in 1871, he had wanted to give it a poetical title; his choice was “Drops of Sunshine.” The publisher shook his head and told him that titles must themselves be destined for popular tastes, either by allusion to some current event or some catchy expression. He suggested two:",CO184CL10

20187,41,“But what does ‘Fine Words Butter No Parsnips’ mean?” asked the composer.,CO184CL10
20188,42,"“Oh, it means nothing at all, but soon enough it’ll be all the rage.”",CO184CL10
20189,43,"Still new to the ways of the world, Pestana refused both titles and kept his polka, but it was not long before he composed another, and the itch of publicity led him to have both of them published, with whatever titles the publisher considered most attractive or appropriate. And thus the pattern was set.",CO184CL10
20190,44,"Now, when the composer delivered his brand-new polka and they came to discussing the title, the publisher remembered that, for quite some time, he had been keeping one aside for the next tune Pestana brought him. It was intriguing and expansive, yet jaunty: “Hey Missus, Hang On to Your Hamper.”",CO184CL10
20191,45,"“And I’ve already thought up another good one for next time,” he added.",CO184CL10
20192,46,"The first edition sold out as soon as it appeared. The composer’s fame was enough to guarantee sales, and in itself the tune was well suited to the genre, being original, danceable, and easily learned by heart. Within one week it was famous. For the first few days Pestana was truly in love with his new creation; he enjoyed humming it to himself, would stop in the street to listen to it being played in some house, and get annoyed when it was played badly. Soon the theater orchestras were playing it, and he even went to one of the performances. Nor was he displeased to hear it whistled, one night, by a shadowy figure coming down Rua do Aterrado.",CO184CL10
20193,47,"The honeymoon lasted only a quarter moon. As on previous occasions, and even more quickly than before, the old masters in the portraits made him bleed with remorse. Angry and ashamed, Pestana raged against the muse who had so often consoled him, she with her impish eyes and warm embraces, so easygoing and so gracious.",CO184CL10
20194,48,"Back came his self-disgust and his loathing of anyone who asked him to play his latest polka, and he resumed his efforts to compose something along classical lines, even if it was only a page, just one, but one that would deserve to be bound between those of Bach and Schumann.

They came to Pestana’s house, to the very room where the portraits hung, bursting in so profusely that he scarcely had time to set them down, have them published, enjoy them for a few days, get bored with them, and return to the same old wellsprings whence nothing flowed.

20209,63,"“Don’t stop,” said Maria. “It’s Chopin, isn’t it?”",CO184CL10
20210,64,"Pestana went pale, stared into space, repeated one or two passages, and stood up. Maria sat down at the piano, and, struggling slightly to remember, played the piece by Chopin. The idea and the motif were the same; Pestana had discovered them in some dark alleyway of his memory, that perfidious old city. Sad and despairing, he left the house and headed toward the bridge, in the direction of São Cristóvão.",CO184CL10
20211,65,“Why struggle?” he asked himself. “I’ll stick to polkas . . . Long live the polka!”,CO184CL10
20212,66,"Passersby hearing this stared at him as if he were mad. He carried on walking, delirious, tormented, an eternal shuttlecock between his ambition and his vocation. He passed the old slaughterhouse; when he came to the railroad crossing, he had the notion of walking up the tracks and waiting for the first train to come and crush him. The guard made him turn back. He came to his senses and went home.",CO184CL10
20213,67,"A few days later—a clear, fresh morning in May 1876—at six o’clock in the morning, Pestana felt a familiar tingling in his fingers. He slipped slowly out of bed so as not to wake Maria, who had been coughing all night and was now sound asleep.",CO184CL10
20214,68,"He went to the room with the portraits, opened the lid of the piano, and, as quietly as he could, knocked out a polka. He had it published under a pseudonym; in the following two months he composed and published two more. Maria knew nothing about it; she carried on coughing and dying, until one night she passed away in the arms of her distraught and despairing husband.",CO184CL10
20215,69,"It was Christmas Eve. Pestana’s suffering was only made worse by the sounds of a dance nearby, where several of his best polkas were being played. The dancing was bad enough; hearing his own compositions gave it all a perverse air of irony.",CO184CL10
20216,70,"He heard the rhythm of the footsteps and imagined the accidentally salacious movements of the dancers, movements that some of his compositions quite frankly called out for; all this as he sat by her pale corpse, mere skin and bones, laid out on the bed. Every hour of the long night passed like that, fast or slow, moistened by tears and sweat, by eau de cologne and Labarraque’s disinfectant, springing ceaselessly back and forth as if to the sound of a polka written by the great invisible Pestana.",CO184CL10
20217,71,"After the burial, the widower had only one goal: to abandon his music forever once he had composed a Requiem, which he would perform on the first anniversary of Maria’s death. Then he would take up some other job: clerk, postman, street peddler, anything that would make him forget his murderous art, so deaf to his aspirations.",CO184CL10
20218,72,"He began the great work. He put everything into it: boldness, patience, thought, and even the occasional flight of fancy, as he had done in times gone by, imitating Mozart, whose Requiem he reread and studied. Weeks and months went by. The work, which at first went quickly, slowed its pace. Pestana had his good days and bad.",CO184CL10
20219,73,"At times he found the music lacking in some way, a sacred soul, ideas, inspiration, or method; at other times his spirits rose and he worked frantically. Eight, nine, ten, eleven months, and the Requiem was still not finished. He redoubled his efforts, neglected his teaching and his friends. He had reworked the piece many times, but now he wanted to finish it, no matter what. Two weeks, one week, five days to go . . . The anniversary dawned and he was still working on it.",CO184CL10
20220,74,"He had to make do with a simple spoken mass, for him alone. It is hard to say whether all the tears that came stealthily to his eyes were those of the husband, or if some were the composer’s. In any event, he never looked at the Requiem again.",CO184CL10
20221,75,“What for?” he asked himself.,CO184CL10
20222,76,"Another year passed. At the beginning of 1878, the publisher came to see him.",CO184CL10
20223,77,"“It’s been two years,” he said, “since you’ve given us one of your lively tunes. Everyone is wondering if you have lost your talent. What have you been doing with yourself?”",CO184CL10
20224,78,“Nothing.”,CO184CL10
20225,79,"“I know what a blow your wife’s death must have been, but it’s been two years now. I’m here to offer you a contract: twenty polkas over the next twelve months; the usual fee, and a higher percentage of the sales. And at the end of the year, we can renew it.”",CO184CL10
20226,80,"Pestana nodded his agreement. He was giving very few lessons, had sold the house to pay off debts, and daily necessities were eating up what little remained. He accepted the contract.",CO184CL10
20227,81,"“But I need the first polka straightaway,” explained the publisher. “It’s urgent. Did you hear that the Emperor has dismissed the Duke of Caxias? The liberals have been summoned to form a government; they’re going ahead with electoral reform. The polka will be called ‘Hurrah for Direct Elections!’ It’s not political, just a good title for the occasion.”",CO184CL10
20228,82,"Pestana composed the first piece for the contract. Despite his lengthy silence, he had lost neither his originality nor his inspiration. It had the same touch of genius. The other polkas followed one by one at regular intervals.",CO184CL10
20229,83,"He had kept the portraits and their subjects’ repertoire, but he avoided spending all his nights at the piano, so as not to fall into new temptations. Now he would always ask for a free ticket whenever there was a good opera or recital on; he would sit in a corner and simply savor the sounds that would never again blossom in his own mind.",CO184CL10
20230,84,"From time to time, on returning home, his head filled with music, the unsung maestro in him would awaken once again; he would sit at the piano and aimlessly play a few notes, then, twenty or thirty minutes later, go to bed.",CO184CL10
20231,85,"And so the years passed, until 1885. Pestana’s fame made him the undisputed master of the polka, but first place in such a village did not suffice for this Caesar, who would still have preferred not the second, but the hundredth place in Rome. He had the same mood swings regarding his compositions as before, the difference being that now they were less violent. No more wild enthusiasm during the first few hours, nor revulsion after the first week; just a degree of pleasure followed by a certain ennui.",CO184CL10
20232,86,"That year, he caught a slight fever. After a few days, the fever rose, and became life-threatening. He was already in grave danger when the publisher appeared, unaware that Pestana was ill; he had come to give him the news that the conservatives were back in power, and to ask him to write a polka for the occasion.",CO184CL10
20233,87,"The nurse, an impoverished theater clarinetist, informed him of Pestana’s condition, and the publisher realized it was best to say nothing. It was the patient himself who insisted that he tell him what he had come for; the publisher obeyed.",CO184CL10
20234,88,"“But only once you’re fully recovered,” he concluded.",CO184CL10
20235,89,"“Just as soon as the fever subsides a little,” said Pestana.",CO184CL10

Then B— collected himself and smiled, as when he had given his second response.

B— had reached that port and gone ashore, taken a few outings, had a few beers, smoked; and at dusk he set off for the wharf, where the jolly boat was awaiting him. He was going to remember adventures from England and scenes from China. As he turned a corner, he saw movement at the far end of the other street, and, always interested in adventures, he sped up to find out what it was. There was already a large crowd when he arrived, a lot of voices and the sound of carts arriving from all directions. He made inquiries in his bad Spanish and found out that there was a fire.",CO214CL08
20255,16,"It was a fire on the third floor of a house; no one knew if the second floor was burning as well. The police, the authorities, and water pumps were about to begin their work, amid a good deal of confusion, to be sure—it couldn’t be otherwise. It was the thought that counted. The nearby onlookers, curious, were talking about the girls. What happened to the girls? Where could the girls be? As it turned out, the third floor of that house was a dressmaker’s workshop run by a Frenchwoman, who taught a lot of the local girls and put them to work. It’s what the officer was able to understand in the midst of the turmoil.",CO214CL08
20256,17,"He stopped to give the firefighters a hand, as well as to catch sight of some scene or custom with which to entertain his fellow officers on board and later his family in Scotland. The Spanish words struck his ears nicely, not as nicely as English ones, of course, but there’s only one English language. The fire grew, devouring things and sowing terror—not that it could all be seen from outside, but at the back of the house, up high, flames shrouded by smoke were shooting out as if they were trying to spread to the entire block.",CO214CL08
20257,18,"B— saw some interesting scenes, which he later forgot, such was the cry of distress and terror that came from the mouth of a man standing next to him. He would never forget that shout; he seemed to hear it even now. He had neither the time nor the language to ask the stranger what was wrong. Nor were they necessary; the man, looking up, had his gaze on the window of the house, and with a shaking hand, pointing. . . .",CO214CL08
20258,19,"Others looked in that direction; the naval officer did the same. There, in the midst of the smoke that was pouring out one of the windows, in the background, the figure of a woman could be made out in the glow. It wasn’t very clear, because of the time of day and the distance, if the glow was coming from another room that was burning or if it was that the fire had already spread to the front room.",CO214CL08
20259,20,"The woman seemed to be hesitating between death by fire and death by falling. Either would have been horrible. Now her figure was entirely enshrouded in smoke, now it appeared again, as if lifeless, overseeing all of the other parts of the catastrophe. The hearts of those below pounded anxiously, but their feet, nailed to the ground by fear, did not dare take them upstairs.",CO214CL08
20260,21,"That situation may or may not have lasted a long time—the officer couldn’t say if it was two seconds or two minutes. He really didn’t know. When he came to his senses he heard another clamor, which the next day’s papers said was the noise of protest and of applause at the same time, as he was seen running in the direction of the house. The officer’s generous heart couldn’t stop him; he crashed through the crowd and went into the hall. A soldier got in his way; he knocked the soldier to the floor and flew up the stairs.",CO214CL08
20261,22,"By then he was feeling the heat of the flames, and the smoke that was coming down was a great obstacle. He had to break through it, breathe it, close his eyes. He didn’t remember how he had managed; he remembered that, despite the difficulties, he made it to the third floor, turned toward a door to the left, pushed it; it was open, and he went into the room.",CO214CL08
20262,23,"It was all smoke, which was pouring out through the windows, and the fire, coming from the adjoining sewing room, was starting to burn the curtains in the room. Below, outside, the din was as loud as ever. B— pushed aside chairs, a small table, and finally reached the window. The smoke cleared in such a way that he was able to see the woman’s torso. . . . He had overcome the danger; he now had to overcome death.",CO214CL08
20263,24,"“The woman,” he said, as he reached the conclusion of his adventure, and probably without the omissions that Abel made at this point in the story, “the woman was a mannequin, a dressmaker’s mannequin, placed there habitually or when the fire broke out—regardless, it was a mannequin.”",CO214CL08
20264,25,"Now, death, not having a woman to take away, seemed to be stalking him, the generous rescuer. The officer doubted for another second; fear could have frozen a person in place, and the mannequin could have been a woman. He made his way over; no, it wasn’t a woman, it was a mannequin; here was its flesh-colored, naked back, here its armless shoulders, here the wooden pole the whole device was sitting on.",CO214CL08
20265,26,"It was now time to flee death. B— turned quickly around. All was smoke by then; the room itself was burning. With such a great effort that he never realized what he had done, he then found himself outside of the room, on the landing. He took the stairs down four at a time.",CO214CL08
20266,27,"On the second floor he ran into firemen with fire extinguishers. One of them, assuming he was a thief taking advantage of the fire to look for valuables, tried to catch hold of him and managed to grab him by the collar; he then recognized his uniform and went on his way.",CO214CL08
20267,28,"Not having anything to do there now that there was little danger, the officer went on down. But the fact is that there is often some unexpected danger. Going through the door to the hall, while the crowd in the street was waiting anxiously for him, a beam, a piece of iron, or what have you fell from above and broke his leg—”",CO214CL08
20268,29,“What?” put in Abel.,CO214CL08
20269,30,"“Exactly,” said the officer. “I don’t know where it came from and I don’t want to know. The papers mentioned it, but I didn’t read those parts of the articles. I know that two soldiers later came to see me, by order of the chief of police.”",CO214CL08
20270,31,"He got treatment on board and at sea. He didn’t keep going for want of comforts that can be found only on land. He came ashore here, in Rio de Janeiro, and went to the hospital, where Abel met him. The battleship waited for him. He was expecting to leave before too long. He didn’t waste time; he was lent the Times and books about history and religion. Finally, he left for Europe. Abel didn’t say good-bye to him.

20274,4,"It was long ago; it was 1850. The estate was Colonel X’s—let’s call him Xavier. A lovely main house, a lot of slaves, but not much discipline, and yields less than what they should have been.

It even seemed to be getting softer in recent times.",CO192CL08

The father wanted him to be a doctor or a lawyer, but the son didn’t, and he wasn’t anything. When the old man died, he left him the estate in good shape, money in the hands of bankers, a great deal of credit, order, and discipline. Xavier was twenty-seven years old. He left Rio in a rush and found his father already buried.",CO192CL08

It was apparently they who started the rumors about the killings ordered by the planter.",CO192CL08
20280,10,"The first two years were, as noted, prosperous. Since the prosperity came from the time of the old man, it’s easy to believe that it was a result of the earlier momentum. It is true, all the same, that Xavier gave all of his attentions to the farm, and to the exertions that had already gone into it he added his own.",CO192CL08

One of them got him a colonel’s commission in the National Guard and advised him to acquire for himself the political power of the town. Another, an old uncle from Minas Gerais, wrote him a letter telling him to get married. “It’s indecent,” concluded the letter, “for you to be living there in a seraglio of Creole women, as they say around here.

He had been quite the gambler, but it was now eighteen months since he had picked up a deck of cards.",CO192CL08

Only later did he find out that at seventeen she had fallen in love with him. Such coincidences are typical of novels; if it weren’t necessary, I wouldn’t mention this circumstance, either. They seem like rehearsed things, and yet, on closer examination, they are common and old.

Neither, for his part, did Xavier find what he had in mind in his honeymoon, which was a celestial body different from the wistful-making and perhaps poetic one, casting a glow of fused pearls—more or less this way—that the wife had dreamed of finding by her husband’s side.

20304,34,"To be sure, he preferred winning to losing—in part to make sure he always had a stake, but it was gambling itself, its risks, its moves, its sudden shifts of fortune, the anxiety of the wait, the struggle, the superstition, belief in one card and disbelief in others, all of these sensations, that drew him to cards. When he gambled that way for a good period of time, day and night, he was sated for a while. The worst thing is that the rest periods got shorter and shorter, and the need came at ever-smaller intervals.",CO192CL08

20306,36,"When it came time for the birth of his child, Xavier was in one of his states of desire; the birth managed to distract him. There was already a doctor in the house, as well as a midwife, one of his wife’s uncles, and two girls. No one wanted for anything. There were saddled horses and servants ready to ride to the nearby town for anything that might be needed. Dona Paula suffered, and hopes died out in the saddest of realities; the child was stillborn. The mother’s grief was profound, her convalescence long.",CO192CL08
20307,37,"Once she was better, Xavier suggested to her that they go to Rio de Janeiro for the opera season; she agreed, less because she wanted to or because she thought it would take her mind off things than because she wanted to yield to her husband’s small access of tenderness. As it turned out, he sent orders for a house and all its conveniences to be arranged for them. They went; Xavier took a box at the theater. Dona Paula had relatives, friends, and acquaintances here; from the outset, life took on a cheerful air.",CO192CL08
20308,38,"For his part, the husband was more attentive to her desires. Was it a rebirth? She supposed it was, and it helped her heal her spirit. She had no shortage of wooers, of admirers, or, naturally, of people who envied her her beauty, her grace, her natural and discreet manners, very much her own. He seemed to take pride in this broad effect. The bond would have been stronger if he had grasped them inwardly.",CO192CL08
20309,39,"Meanwhile, shortly after their arrival, his nights out started up again. For the first time, when he came back (at four in the morning), dona Paula was still up, anxious, dressed, and she flung herself at him, glad to see him. She was sincerely dreading some danger; she wasn’t thinking about affairs or cards. Xavier didn’t share his wife’s anxiety or understand her fears. He answered her in annoyance; he told her she was wrong not to have gone to sleep.",CO192CL08
20310,40,“Am I some sort of child?”,CO192CL08
20311,41,"“But, Xavier. . . .”",CO192CL08
20312,42,"“I’m a country bumpkin, but I know the city like the palm of my hand. You already have the defects of girls from Rio; before too long you’ll have a fit of hysterics. What’s this crying? Go to bed; stop bugging me. Rest; I’m not going to lose my way.”",CO192CL08
20313,43,"The second night out was three days later; dona Paula managed to fall asleep only very late. She woke up when he came in but didn’t open her eyes. The next day he admitted to her that he had been at a friend’s house, playing voltarete.[2]",CO192CL08
20314,44,"“Before we realized it,” he concluded, “it was two in the morning.”",CO192CL08
20315,45,"From then on, when he was going to spend the night out, he wouldn’t leave without telling her: “I’m going out for some voltarete.” Dona Paula knew it was the truth, and she got used to going to bed at the country hour, since he accompanied her nights at the theater or when they had company, and they naturally went to bed late.",CO192CL08
20316,46,V,CO192CL08
20317,47,"They came back to Rio again and again, until Xavier left the estate entirely in the overseer’s hands and settled down to live here. Around the house, he entrusted his wife to herself and went on leading his usual life. By then three years had gone by. Habit and decorum bound them; neither loved the other. There came no child to make up for the absence of conjugal love.",CO192CL08
20318,48,"Dona Paula got more and more beautiful. Rio perfected her natural gifts. In the interior, she didn’t need to follow the elegant ritual or the great changes of fashion.",CO192CL08
20319,49,"In Rio, the necessity became clear, and it found hers a very well-disposed spirit. She liked being well dressed, being seen, going everywhere; and she did not want for friends or relatives to go with her and satisfy her every whim. Balls, theaters—she had everything she wanted, since her husband didn’t refuse her money for anything at all. At times, befuddled by his gambling, he answered her inappropriately:",CO192CL08
20320,50,“Vergueiro’s ball?”,CO192CL08
20321,51,“Yes; it’s the seventh.”,CO192CL08

20326,56,"Let the fellow’s befuddlement not seem excessive. Naturally, the thought of some unusual, serious game, a huge competition for money or for the honor of victory had lodged in his brain, where no other idea found room. By then, dona Paula was able to laugh at these absurdities. Afterward, she would explain her laughter, and he would laugh, too, and mention the reason for his confusion. When she noticed that it annoyed him, she avoided explanations.",CO192CL08
20327,57,"Her husband was disagreeable, dull, said the same things over and over, and took a slight interest in things that, for her, were worth nothing at all. He no longer cared about what time he came in; he would come back at dawn, sometimes in the morning light, at half past six or later. Dona Paula slept until nine and breakfasted alone. Other times, the gambling was at home, but the house was big, and the gaming room was in the back. In the front, she received guests, played music, and laughed. The pact between the two of them, in such cases, was to say that he wasn’t home.",CO192CL08
20328,58,VI,CO192CL08
20329,59,"More than a year went by that way. Dona Paula was about to turn twenty-six, like someone who ascends from one splendor to the next; she must have been one of those women perfected by thirty years of age and not blemished by forty. What more natural than that she should have admirers? She found herself the object of covetous gazes and badly dissimulated desires.",CO192CL08
20330,60,"At first, she savored them discreetly, without ever reciprocating; but freedom, the number of admirers, and the conviction that she had nothing to lose by it caused her to be grateful for and flattered by the worship of so many people. A lot of conversations concerning her were repeated to her; elderly but waggish men told her to her face, by their wives’ sides, things that were going around—names she was given, star of the south, queen of the parlors, and others just as banal as these but equally sincere.",CO192CL08
20331,61,"She knew half a dozen men who were especially constant callers at the places she went to, and more obstinate about letting her know they desired her. Dona Paula was not flustered by the number or by the misbehavior; she let them come. One of them, a law school graduate, was thirty years old and had the finest masculine head of his day. His name was João Góis.",CO192CL08
20332,62,"Single and well-off. He was a distant relative of a woman who lived in Tijuca, where the two of them spoke for the first time. Dona Paula knew him from having seen him several times, either at the theater or on Rua do Ouvidor. He reminded her of the long, overbearing eyes she avoided meeting for fear of the duel, for fear of emerging wounded; she barely glanced at them, beneath tremulous eyelids. In Tijuca she had to look at them, although as little as possible, and she saw confirmation of those fears of hers. She thought about them, however, and didn’t dream of others.",CO192CL08
20333,63,"She also had an adorer of twenty-two, with kind and gentle eyes, a beardless face, a pitiful tugged and twisted fluff that didn’t manage to be a mustache. Dona Paula was this young man’s first love. At home, nights, he cried over her and wrote long letters to send her the next day, letters that never went out, because he wanted for everything: messenger and audacity.",CO192CL08
20334,64,"João Góis didn’t want for audacity or, if he had needed them, messengers. In a short time he and the husband made each other’s acquaintance. Góis didn’t like cards, but he submitted to playing with Xavier those nights that he, by chance, didn’t go out or didn’t have his usual fellow punters.",CO192CL08
20335,65,"Dona Paula was full of terror the first few weeks; having played with fired, she was naturally terrified by the thought of seeing it reach her skirts. Góis, who was audacious, was also skillful, and he resolved first to win her trust. Once he had done so, he made his feelings known, and the battle, if hard fought, did not last long; his triumph was total.",CO192CL08
20336,66,VII,CO192CL08
20337,67,"I won’t dwell extensively on dona Paula’s feelings. They were of two sorts, but it must be said that fear, virtue’s last hope, ceased to exist along with her virtue; and the blindness the man’s eyes caused her kept her from seeing danger or undoing any longer. She didn’t fear her husband; one can assume she didn’t fear gossip. She was all the other man’s; one can assume that the passion once inspired by husband, when she was seventeen, had opened the wrong door and that she really loved only one man on earth: this relative of the woman from Tijuca.",CO192CL08
20338,68,"Little by little, the truth became apparent to other people; they were unable to hide it, and it may be that he didn’t want to. Vanity, for the rest, wasn’t the man’s strongest link; his love was truly furious, but the victor’s glory grew with news of the possession. The news was passed on out of envy, out of pleasure, out of perversion, inside and out, at the theater and at balls, no less in the cockpit than between shopkeepers’ two hands of voltarete, at night, in the outskirts. Clues were racked up; the lives of the two of them were scrutinized; out came incidents, dinners, meetings. And, although there was no longer any need to invent anything, a thing or two was still invented.",CO192CL08
20339,69,"Dona Paula lived at a complete remove from the rumors. She was unable to read the expressions of other women and found no noticeable difference in their attitudes. Some, out of genuine disgust, kept away from her, but with such courtesy that the young woman didn’t notice the separation. Besides, in such a state, what separation could she notice?",CO192CL08
20340,70,"She had friends who tried to get plainspoken confessions of the secret of her life; none succeeded. One, no less close, tried to punish her through generic criticism and condemnation of her behavior; she didn’t understand her. What was society without him? What was virtue apart from him? Such was the moral state of Xavier’s wife when what I’m going to tell you about happened.",CO192CL08

20342,72,"One day, it struck Góis to suggest to dona Paula that they leave Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and go to any other country in the world—to the United States, if she liked, or to some corner of Italy. France itself, Paris, was a world where nobody would run into them.",CO192CL08

20350,80,"Total romanticism. Góis took her hands and thanked her for her answer. He asked her if she weren’t yielding unwillingly, or if it was with all her heart, if she would suffer if he went away on his own and left her. . . . Dona Paula’s response was to cover his mouth; he couldn’t have gotten a more eloquent one. Góis kissed her hand.",CO192CL08

20356,86,"For a few moments both of them kept quiet. He toyed with one of her hands; she smoothed his hair. If we look into their thoughts, we will find one and the other, and nothing about the land where they would go. Góis, at least, thought only of that, after some ten minutes or more of ecstasy, reverie, reminiscences, and dreams, and he made sure to give the beautiful dona Paula another reason to take fright.",CO192CL08

20361,91,“And if I just suggested my house?”,CO192CL08
20362,92,"Dona Paula didn’t know what to say. The suggestion was audacious, so far outside the realm of the possible, that she thought it was a joke and she looked at him without saying anything. She apparently even started to laugh, but then, which she saw nothing on his face that looked like a joke or even like gentleness, she went serious.",CO192CL08
20363,93,"She was already familiar with his expression of obstinacy, and she had reason to be familiar with the gamut of his acts of boldness. Even so, she didn’t immediately believe him.

20371,101,"Dona Paula didn’t have the courage to cover his mouth this time. She shook her head with a reproachful gaze and bitter cast to her lips; it was as if she had done nothing. Góis got up and held out his hand. She put it in hers, made him sit down, tried to show him that his suggestion was a mistake, but she lost herself in vague and incoherent words that he didn’t hear, because he had his eyes on the tips of his shoes.",CO192CL08

20373,103,"Góis triumphed. Not too many hours later, they had arranged everything. Dona Paula would leave the next Saturday for the house where he lived, in Andaraí. It all seems like a dream, and the pen has trouble obeying my hand, but the truth is that it is true. To account in one way or another for this act of folly, one must not forget that he loved scandal most of all; and that she, not feeling herself tied by any other bond, didn’t realize she was imperiling herself.",CO192CL08
20374,104,"She was going to break from everybody, close all doors, confirm public suspicions, brave public opinion—all as if she had been born for a society different from the one she lived in.

20377,107,"This discovery bothered him; he left without referring at all to the next day’s move. Dona Paula, ready to commit the transgression, was too ashamed to bring it up, and the two of them took leave of each other as if they were not going to bind their fates a few hours later.",CO192CL08

20447,11,“What impression would modern clothing leave on an Athenian?”,CO078CL07
20448,12,"I have been a Spiritist for a few months. Convinced that all systems are pure nihilisms, I decided to choose the most recreational of them. There will come a time when this is not only recreational but also useful for solving historical problems. It is more concise to evoke the spirit of the dead than to expend critical efforts, to expend them uselessly, because there is no reason or document that can better explain the intention of an act than the author of the act himself.",CO078CL07
20449,13,"Such was my case last night. Conjecturing about what Alcibiades’s impression might be was a way to pass the time with no advantage other than to admire my own ability. So I determined I would invoke the Athenian. I asked him to appear at my house immediately, without delay.",CO078CL07
20450,14,"This is when the extraordinary part of the story starts. Alcibiades came without delay. Two minutes later, he was there, in the living room, by the wall. But he was not the impalpable shade that I expected to evoke through our school’s methods; it was Alcibiades himself. He was flesh and blood, a real man, an authentic Greek, dressed in the old manner, full of that gentility and distinction that he used to harangue the great assemblies of Athens and, occasionally, its fools.",CO078CL07
20451,15,"Since Your Excellency knows so much about history, he cannot be unaware that there were idiots in Athens. Yes, Athens had them and that precedent was an excuse. I swear to Your Excellency that I did not believe it. No matter how true the testimony of my senses was, I could not fully believe that not the shadow of Alcibiades but Alcibiades himself was there, in my house, alive as can be.",CO078CL07

20453,17,“What do you want from me?” he asked.,CO078CL07
20454,18,"Upon hearing this, the hair stood up all over my body. The figure spoke on and on in Greek, the purest Attic. It was him. There was no doubt it was really him, a man dead for twenty centuries, restored to life in such a cabalistic manner that it seemed he had just then come from cutting the famous tail off the dog.",CO078CL07
20455,19,"It was clear that, without thinking about it, I had just taken a huge step in my Spiritist career. But oh my! I did not understand it then and allowed myself to be caught by surprise. He repeated the question, looked around himself, and sat in an armchair. Since he realized I was cold and shaking (I still am now), he spoke to me quite tenderly, and he tried to laugh and make jokes to restore my peace and confidence. Deft as ever! What else can I tell Your Excellency?",CO078CL07

20458,22,"I limited myself to answering what he asked. He requested news from Athens. I gave them to him. I told him that it was finally the head of a unified Greece. I recounted the Muslim invasion, independence, Botzaris, Lord Byron. The great man could only stare at my mouth, and I could only feel shocked that the dead had not told him anything. He explained that at the threshold to that world, the interests of this one dwindled.",CO078CL07
20459,23,"He had not seen Botzaris or Lord Byron, in the first place because there are so, so many spirits that they naturally find themselves disoriented, and secondly because there they gather not by nationalities or another order, but by the categories of their nature, custom, and profession. So it is that he, Alcibiades, stays with the group of elegant politicians and lovers, with the Duke of Buckingham, Garrett, our own Maciel Monteiro, et cetera. He immediately asked for recent news, and I told him what I knew.",CO078CL07
20460,24,"In sum, I told him about the Hellenic Parliament and about the alternative method in which Bulgaris and Comondouros, patrician statesmen of his land, imitate Disraeli and Gladstone, taking turns being in power, and, just like them, coming to blows in their speeches. He, who was a magnificent orator, interrupted me:",CO078CL07

20463,27,"He was also sarcastic; at least that is how he seemed at one or two points during our conversation. But for most of it, he showed himself to be modest, attentive, correct, sensitive, and dignified. And well-dressed – know this, Your Excellency – just as well-dressed as in the old days. He would glance at the mirror, just as our women and others do in our times. He would look at his boots, arrange his robe. He always carried himself in a certain sculptural way.",CO078CL07

20465,29,"But I could not go on. Having entered into the indecipherable, the marvelous, I thought anything was possible. He saw no reason why, since he had come to the temporal world to talk with me, I could not go visit him in eternity. Hearing this idea, I froze. For a man who had just digested dinner and was waiting for Casino time, death is the ultimate sarcasm.",CO078CL07
20466,30,"If I could run away. . . . All of a sudden, I got excited. I told him I was going to a ball.",CO078CL07

20470,34,"“No,” I added, “the pyrrhic has gone away. Every age, my dear Alcibiades, changes dances like it changes its ideas. We no longer do the dances of the last century; the twentieth century will probably not dance those from this age. The pyrrhic is no more, along with Plutarch’s men and the numens of Hesiod.”",CO078CL07

Zeus, Dionysus, Aphrodite. . .” He would mumble every now and then. He reminded me that he was once accused of blaspheming the gods, and I asked myself where that posthumous and naturally fake indignation originated. I had forgotten – a devotee of Greek! – I had forgotten that he was also a refined hypocrite, an illustrious faker. And I almost did not have time to notice this, because Alcibiades, stopping suddenly, declared that he would go to the ball with me.",CO078CL07

20480,44,"“Yes, let us go to the ball.”",CO078CL07
20481,45,"I was terrified. I told him no, that it was impossible, that they would not let him in – not with those clothes. He would look like a madman – unless he was going there to perform a comedy by Aristophanes! – I added, laughing and trying to cover up my fear. What I wanted to do was get away from him, leave the house to him, and once outside, I would not go to the Casino but instead come see Your Excellency.",CO078CL07
20482,46,"But the devil would not move. He listened to me as he looked at the floor, pensive, deliberative. I stopped talking. I started to wonder if the nightmare had ended, if the figure would disappear, and if I would be left there with my pants, my shoes, and my century.",CO078CL07
20483,47,"“I want to go to the ball,” he repeated. “Now I cannot leave without comparing dances.”",CO078CL07
20484,48,"“My dear Alcibiades, I think this is an imprudent wish. It would certainly give me the greatest honor, so much pride to bring the most genteel, the most charming Athenian to the Casino, but the people of today, the young men and women, the old people . . . it is impossible.”",CO078CL07
20485,49,“Why?”,CO078CL07
20486,50,"“I already told you. They will think you are a madman or a comedian, because those clothes. . . .”",CO078CL07
20487,51,“So what? Clothing changes. I will go in this century’s style. Do you have no clothes you can lend me?”,CO078CL07
20488,52,"I was going to say no, but it occurred to me just then that what was most urgent was to get out of there, and once we were out of the house, there were ample resources to aid my escape, so I agreed.",CO078CL07
20489,53,"“Very well, then,” he responded, getting up, “I will go in the fashion of this century. I only ask that you get dressed first so that I learn and then imitate you.”",CO078CL07
20490,54,"I got up too and asked him to come with me. He did not move immediately. He was perplexed. I realized that only then he had noticed my white pants. He stared at them, wide-eyed and drop-jawed. He finally asked what the purpose of the cloth tubes.",CO078CL07
20491,55,"I responded that they were for greater comfort. I added that our century, more modest and practical than artistic, had decided to dress in a manner compatible with its decorum and seriousness. Furthermore, not everyone was Alcibiades. I believe I flattered him with that part. He smiled and shrugged.",CO078CL07
20492,56,“Well!”,CO078CL07
20493,57,"We proceeded to my dressing room, and I started hurriedly changing clothes. Alcibiades reclined lazily on a divan, not without praising it, not without complimenting the mirror, the caned seats, the pictures. I got dressed in a hurry, as I said, and, anxious to get out of there, intended to hop on the first tilbury that passed by. . . .",CO078CL07
20494,58,“Black tubes!” he exclaimed.,CO078CL07
20495,59,"They were the black pants I had just put on. He shouted and laughed, a little laugh in which the fear came mixed with derision, which greatly offended my sense of etiquette as a modern man.",CO078CL07
20496,60,"Because, Your Excellency will note that, even though our era seems worthy of criticism and even execration, we don’t like it when an ancient comes and laughs in our face. I did not answer the Athenian. I furrowed my brow a bit and continued buttoning my suspenders. He then asked me why I was wearing such an ugly color. . . .",CO078CL07
20497,61,"“Ugly, but serious,” I said. “But look at the graceful cut, see how it falls over the shoe, which has varnish, even if it is black, and made with great skill.”",CO078CL07
20498,62,And I saw that he was shaking his head:,CO078CL07
20499,63,"“My dear sir,” I told him, “you can certainly demand that the Jupiter of Olympus be the eternal emblem of majesty: it is the domain of ideal, disinterested art, superior to the times that go by and the men who accompany them. But the art of fashion is different.",CO078CL07
20500,64,"That which seems absurd or clumsy is perfectly rational and beautiful – beautiful in our own way, since we do not go around hearing the music of the rhapsodes reciting their verses in the streets, or the speeches of the orators, or the philosophies of the philosophers.

20501,65,"“Scoundrel!” he yelled, hurling himself upon me.",CO078CL07
20502,66,"Before I could understand the shout and the gesture, every drop of blood left my body. The cause: an illusion. Since I had wrapped my tie around my neck and was tying the knot, Alcibiades supposed that I was going to hang myself, as he later confessed. And, actually, he was pallid, tremulous, in a cold sweat.",CO078CL07
20503,67,"I was the one who laughed then. I laughed and explained the use of a necktie to him, and I noted that it was white, not black, although we also used black ties. Only after I had explained all this did he return it to me. I finally tied it and put on my vest.",CO078CL07
20504,68,"“By Aphrodite!” he exclaimed. “You are the most singular thing I have seen in my life and in death. You are entirely the color of night – a night with only three stars.” He kept pointing at the buttons on my chest. “The world must be immensely melancholic, if it chose such a dead, sad color. We were more joyous. We lived . . . ”",CO078CL07
20505,69,"He could not finish the sentence. I finished tucking in my dress-coat, and the consternation of the Athenian was indescribable. His arms fell. He stopped breathing. He could not speak. He had his big, open eyes fixed on me. Believe me, Your Excellency, I was scared, and I tried to hurry my exit.",CO078CL07

20507,71,“No. I need my hat.”,CO078CL07
20508,72,"“Oh, I hope there is something that can make up for the rest!” Alcibiades replied in a supplicant voice. “I hope, I hope it does. As it is, the only elegance you will leave behind is reduced to a pair of closed tubes and a pair of open ones.” (He said this holding up my coattails.) “And all of it in that irksome, negative color. No, I cannot believe it! Something should come along to make up for this. What is it that you say you lack?”",CO078CL07

20511,75,"I obeyed. I went from there to the hatrack, grabbed the hat, and put it on my head. Alcibiades looked at me, wobbled and fell. I ran to the illustrious Athenian to pick him up, but (and I say this with great pain) it was too late. He was dead, dead for the second time.",CO078CL07

20521,8,"That is precisely what happened this evening. The book fell open at the life of Alcibiades. I allowed myself to be seduced by the flow of those Attic cadences; within moments, I was entering the Olympic Games, marveling at that flower of Athenian manhood as he drove his chariot magnificently, with the grace and determination he had always shown on the battlefield, or when curbing his fellow citizens or his own sensual urges.",CO078CL12

20525,12,"I have been a spiritualist for some months now, because, convinced that all systems are pure nothingness, I decided to adopt the most enjoyable one. The time will come when it is not only enjoyable, but also useful for solving historical problems: it is far quicker to summon the spirits of the dead than to expend one’s own critical energies to no good end, because no rationale or theory can better explain the intention of an act than the author of the act himself.",CO078CL12
20526,13,"Such was my goal this evening. Wondering what Alcibiades might have thought was a sheer waste of time, with no benefit beyond the pleasure of admiring my own cleverness. I therefore decided to summon up the Athenian, and asked him to appear in my house forthwith, without delay.",CO078CL12
20527,14,"And here begins the extraordinary part of the adventure. Alcibiades lost no time in answering my call; two minutes later, he was there, in my parlor, standing by the wall, but he was not the intangible shadow I had expected to summon using our schoolboy methods; it was the real Alcibiades, flesh and blood, the man himself, authentically Greek, dressed like the ancients, and full of that blend of courtesy and audacity with which he used to harangue the great assemblies of Athens, and occasionally its fools.",CO078CL12

You, sir, who were my schoolroom companion, will remember that ever since I was a boy I have had a passion for Greek, a passion or indeed a mania, which was the name you gave it, and one so intense that it often led me to fail in other subjects.",CO078CL10

20598,8,"That is precisely what happened this evening. The book fell open at the life of Alcibiades. I allowed myself to be seduced by the flow of those Attic cadences; within moments, I was entering the Olympic Games, marveling at that flower of Athenian manhood as he drove his chariot magnificently, with the grace and determination he had always shown on the battlefield, or when curbing his fellow citizens or his own sensual urges.",CO078CL10

20601,11,“What would that illustrious Athenian make of modern-day dress?”,CO078CL10
20602,12,"I have been a spiritualist for some months now, because, convinced that all systems are pure nothingness, I decided to adopt the most enjoyable one. The time will come when it is not only enjoyable, but also useful for solving historical problems: it is far quicker to summon the spirits of the dead than to expend one’s own critical energies to no good end, because no rationale or theory can better explain the intention of an act than the author of the act himself.",CO078CL10
20603,13,"Such was my goal this evening. Wondering what Alcibiades might have thought was a sheer waste of time, with no benefit beyond the pleasure of admiring my own cleverness. I therefore decided to summon up the Athenian, and asked him to appear in my house forthwith, without delay.",CO078CL10
20604,14,"And here begins the extraordinary part of the adventure. Alcibiades lost no time in answering my call; two minutes later, he was there, in my parlor, standing by the wall, but he was not the intangible shadow I had expected to summon using our schoolboy methods; it was the real Alcibiades, flesh and blood, the man himself, authentically Greek, dressed like the ancients, and full of that blend of courtesy and audacity with which he used to harangue the great assemblies of Athens, and occasionally its fools.",CO078CL10
20605,15,"You, sir, who know so much about history, cannot ignore the fact that there were, indeed, some fools in Athens. Yes, even Athens had fools, a precedent that perhaps gives us something of an excuse. I swear I could not believe it; no matter what my senses told me, I could not believe that it was not a ghost standing there before me, but Alcibiades himself, restored to life.",CO078CL10
20606,16,"I still nurtured the hope that it was nothing more than the effects of indigestion, a simple excess of gastric fluids, magnified through the lens of Plutarch. And so I rubbed my eyes, stared, and . . .",CO078CL10
20607,17,“What do you want from me?” he asked.,CO078CL10
20608,18,"On hearing this, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The figure spoke, and spoke Greek, the purest Attic. There was no doubting that it was the man himself, dead for twenty centuries, brought back from the grave, and as alive as if he had come straight from cutting off his poor dog’s tail, as he so famously did.",CO078CL10
20609,19,"It was clear that, without a moment’s thought, I had just taken a great stride forward along the path of spiritualism. But, silly me, I didn’t, at first, realize this, and I allowed myself to be caught off guard. He repeated the question, looked around him, and sat down in an armchair. He saw that I was cold and trembling (as I still am even now), and spoke to me rather tenderly, even trying to laugh and joke so as to put me at my ease. As deft as ever! What more can I say?",CO078CL10
20610,20,"A few minutes later, we were chatting away in ancient Greek, he reclining nonchalantly in his chair, I earnestly begging all the saints in heaven to send some sort of distraction—a servant, a visitor, a local constable, or even, should it prove necessary, for a fire to break out.",CO078CL10

20612,22,"Needless to say, I gave up on the idea of consulting him on modern-day dress; I had summoned a ghost, not a “real-life” man, as children say. I limited myself to replying to his questions; he asked me for news about Athens, and I obliged; I said that Athens was finally the capital of a unified Greece; I told him about the long years of Muslim domination, then about independence, Botsaris, and Lord Byron. The great man hung on my every word and, when I expressed surprise that the dead had told him nothing of all this, he explained to me that when one stood at the gates of the other world, one’s interest in this world waned considerably.",CO078CL10
20613,23,"He had met neither Botsaris nor Lord Byron—firstly, because there is such a vast multitude of spirits that it’s very easy to miss someone, and secondly, because there the dead are grouped not according to nationality or some similar category, but according to their temperament, customs, and profession. Thus he, Alcibiades, forms part of a group of elegant, passionate politicians, alongside the Duke of Buckingham, Almeida Garrett, our very own Maciel Monteiro, etc.",CO078CL10
20614,24,"Then he asked me about current affairs; I briefly told him what I knew; I spoke of the Hellenic parliament and the rather different way in which his compatriot statesmen, Voulgaris and Koumoundouros, are going about imitating Disraeli and Gladstone in taking turns at government, and, just like them, trading oratorical blows.

20617,27,"He was also somewhat sarcastic, or at least that’s how he came across at one or two points in our conversation. But, in general, he showed himself to be simple, attentive, polite, sensitive, and dignified. And quite the dandy, too, as dandyish as in ancient times; he was always glancing sideways at the mirror, just as women and others do in our own century, admiring his buskins, adjusting his cloak, and striking sculptural poses.",CO078CL10

20619,29,"But I couldn’t. Having entered into the realm of the inextricable and the marvelous, I believed that anything was possible, and just as he had come to meet me in this world, I couldn’t see why I couldn’t go and join him in eternity. I froze at this idea. For a man who has just had his dinner and is waiting for the Cassino to open, death would be a joke in the very worst possible taste.",CO078CL10

20675,8,"He went over to the teacher and spoke to him very quietly. The teacher asked him to sit down, then glanced across at me, and I think he must have asked my uncle something, because Uncle Zeca then launched into a long explanation. The teacher questioned him further, and my uncle answered, and, finally, the teacher turned to me and said:",CO213CL08
20676,9,"“Senhor José Martins, you may leave.”",CO213CL08
20677,10,"My sense of pleasure overcame any feelings of fear and confusion. I was only ten years old and I loved having fun and loathed school. Being summoned home by my uncle, my father’s brother, who had arrived the previous day from Guaratiba, must indicate some celebration or outing, or something of the sort.",CO213CL08
20678,11,"I ran to fetch my hat, stuffed my exercise book into my pocket, and went down the steps of the school—a two-story building in Rua do Senado. In the corridor, I kissed Uncle Zeca’s hand, and once we were out in the street, I trotted along beside him, looking up at his face. He still said nothing, and I didn’t dare ask any questions. Shortly afterward, we reached my sister Felícia’s school; my uncle told me to wait, went up the school steps, and eventually they both emerged, and the three of us set off home.",CO213CL08
20679,12,"I was feeling even more excited now. I was sure some celebration awaited us, because both of us were there, walking ahead of my uncle, exchanging questions and conjectures. Perhaps it was Uncle Zeca’s birthday. I turned to look at him; he had his eyes fixed on the ground, probably so that he wouldn’t stumble.",CO213CL08
20680,13,"On we walked. Felícia was a year older than me. She was wearing flat shoes tied on with ribbons that crisscrossed her instep and ended in a bow around her ankles. I was wearing a pair of very worn cheap leather boots. Her bloomers just reached the ribbons on her ankles, whereas my baggy cotton pants reached down to my feet.",CO213CL08
20681,14,"Once or twice we stopped, she to admire the dolls displayed outside the notions stores, while I paused anywhere that had a parrot bobbing up and down on a perch to which it would be attached by a metal chain. It was usually a parrot I’d met before, but, to a ten-year-old, parrots are always of unfailing interest.",CO213CL08
20682,15,"Uncle Zeca would drag us away from all these commercial or natural spectacles. “Come on,” he would say in a gruff voice. And we would continue walking, until some other curiosity made us stop. The main thing was the party awaiting us at home.",CO213CL08
20683,16,"“I don’t think it can be Uncle Zeca’s birthday,” Felícia said.",CO213CL08

20695,28,"We finally agreed that it could be a party even if it wasn’t anyone’s birthday. A big lottery win, for example. It occurred to me, too, that it could be election time. My godfather was a candidate for alderman, and although I didn’t really know what “candidate” or “alderman” meant, I’d heard so much talk about his imminent victory that I assumed it was already done and dusted.",CO213CL08
20696,29,"I didn’t know that elections were always held on a Sunday, and today was Friday. I imagined music bands and cheering and people clapping, with us kids leaping about and laughing and eating coconut candy. There might be some sort of performance later on. I felt positively dizzy with excitement. I had been to the theater just once and had fallen asleep on the way home, but the following day I was so happy that I longed to go again, even though I hadn’t understood a word of what I’d heard, because I’d seen a lot of things: fancy chairs, thrones, long spears, scenes that changed before your eyes, going from parlor to forest and from forest to street.",CO213CL08
20697,30,"And all the characters were princes. At least that’s what we called the ones wearing silk breeches, buckled shoes or boots, swords, velvet capes, and plumed caps. There was dancing too. The dancers, male and female, spoke with their feet and hands, changing position all the time and with a permanent smile on their lips. Then the audience started shouting and clapping . . .",CO213CL08
20698,31,"That’s the second time I’ve mentioned “clapping” now, but that’s because I knew about clapping. When I told Felícia about the possibility of some kind of performance, she didn’t seem so keen, nor did she reject it entirely, either. She wouldn’t mind going to the theater. Or perhaps the performance would be at home, maybe a puppet show. We were still engaged in these conjectures, when Uncle Zeca told us to stop while he talked to someone.",CO213CL08
20699,32,"We waited. The idea of a party, of whatever kind, still excited us; well, more me than her. Myriad possibilities sprang up in my imagination, all of them incomplete, because they came into my head so quickly and in such confusion that I couldn’t actually grasp them; some may even have appeared more than once.",CO213CL08
20700,33,"Felícia pointed out two houseboys wearing scarlet skullcaps, who were walking past carrying canes, and that reminded us of the feast nights of Saint Anthony and Saint John, which were both long gone. Then I told her about the bonfires we lit in the playground, about the Roman candles and Catherine wheels and firecrackers we set off, and how we boys danced together. Perhaps it would be something like that . . .",CO213CL08
20701,34,"Then I suddenly remembered that you were supposed to throw your schoolbook on the fire; she could throw hers, too, the one containing all the different stitches she was learning.",CO213CL08

20707,40,"“Nine o’clock, is it? I’ll be there.”",CO213CL08
20708,41,"“Come along,” Uncle Zeca told us, when the man had gone.",CO213CL08
20709,42,"I wanted to ask him who the man was; he seemed vaguely familiar. Felícia thought the same, but neither of us could put a name to his face; however, his promise to be there at nine o’clock struck home. It must be a party or a dance, because we were usually sent to bed at nine o’clock.",CO213CL08
20710,43,"Given the exceptional circumstances, though, we would still be awake. When we reached a muddy puddle, I grabbed Felícia’s hand, and we both leapt over it, so energetically that my schoolbook almost fell out of my pocket. I glanced at Uncle Zeca to gauge his reaction; he was shaking his head disapprovingly. I laughed and Felicia smiled and we continued on down the sidewalk.",CO213CL08
20711,44,"It was a day for meeting strangers. The next two strangers were riding donkeys, and one of them was a woman. They had come from the fields. Uncle Zeca went out into the street to talk to them, having first told us to wait. The donkeys stopped, and I said that they had done so of their own accord because they knew Uncle Zeca, too, an idea that Felícia hotly rejected, and which I defended, laughing. I wasn’t really serious; it was all in good fun. Anyway, we waited, studying those two country folk.",CO213CL08
20712,45,"They were both very thin, the woman even more so than the man, and she was younger too; he had gray hair. We didn’t hear what they said, the man or Uncle Zeca, but we saw the husband eyeing us curiously and saying something to his wife, who then also looked at us, this time with something like pity in her eyes. Then they moved on, Uncle Zeca rejoined us, and we set off again for the house.",CO213CL08
20713,46,"Our house was in the next street, near the corner. As we turned that corner, we were horrified to see that all the doors on our house were draped in black cloth. We instinctively stopped and turned to Uncle Zeca. He came over to us, took us each by the hand, and was about to say something, but the words stuck in his throat. He walked on, taking us with him.",CO213CL08
20714,47,"When we arrived, the doors were both ajar. I don’t know if I mentioned before that the house was a notions store. Inquisitive onlookers were standing in the street. The windows opposite and on either side were filled with heads. There was a sudden buzz of voices as we approached. Needless to say, Felícia and I could not believe what we were seeing. Uncle Zeca pushed open one of the doors, we all went in, and then he shut the door behind us, and led us down the hallway to the dining room and the bedroom.",CO213CL08
20715,48,"Inside, next to the bed, sat my mother, her head in her hands. When she realized we were there, she leapt to her feet and came to embrace us, weeping and crying:",CO213CL08
20716,49,"“My children, your father is dead!”",CO213CL08
20717,50,"The shock was enormous, even though confusion and uncertainty partially numbed my ability to grasp this news. I couldn’t move; indeed, I felt afraid to do so. Dead? How? Why? I ask those questions now in order to move the action along, because, at the time, I asked nothing of myself or of anyone else.",CO213CL08
20718,51,"I could hear my mother’s words echoing inside my head, along with her loud sobbing. She clung to us and dragged us over to the bed, where her husband’s body lay, and she made us kiss his hand. I felt so removed from it all that, despite everything, I did not, at first, understand, although the sadness and silence of the people around the bed helped make it clear that my father really had died.",CO213CL08
20719,52,"It wasn’t a saint’s day, full of fun and play, it wasn’t a party, we wouldn’t be allowed to idle away the hours, long or short, far from the torments of school. I cannot honestly say whether that fall from such a delightful dream increased my childish grief or not; best not think about it. My father was lying there dead, with no leaping, no dancing, no laughter, no music bands, all of which were also dead. If I had been told when Uncle Zeca came to the school why they had come looking for me, joy would never have entered my heart, from which it was now being soundly beaten out.",CO213CL08
20720,53,"The funeral took place the next day at nine o’clock in the morning, and the friend my Uncle Zeca had met in the street was probably there, too, the one who had said goodbye with a promise to be there at nine. I didn’t see the ceremony; I remember only a few figures, not many, all dressed in black. My godfather, who owned an import-export business, was also present, as was his wife, and she took me to a room at the back of the church to show me some engravings. When we left, I heard my mother’s cries, the muffled sound of footsteps, a few murmured words from the people taking hold of the coffin handles, something like: “turn to the side . . . slightly more to the left . . . that’s it, hold on tight . . .” Then, in the distance, I saw the hearse followed by the closed carriages . . .",CO213CL08
20721,54,"There went my father and the holiday! A day off from school, but no rest! It wasn’t just one day, either, it was eight, eight days of grief, during which I occasionally thought about school. My mother would weep as she made our mourning clothes, in between visits from people offering their condolences. I cried too; I didn’t see my father when I would usually see him, didn’t hear his voice at the table or at the counter, or the tender words he addressed to the birds, for he was a great lover of birds, and kept three or four of them in cages.",CO213CL08
20722,55,"My mother barely spoke, or, when she did, it was only to outsiders. That is how I learned that my father had died of apoplexy. I heard this over and over, because visitors always asked how he had died, and she would tell them everything, the hour, the expression on his face, the circumstances; he had gone to get a drink of water, and was just filling his glass and standing at the window that looked out onto the courtyard. I learned the story by heart just from hearing her tell it so often.",CO213CL08
20723,56,"And yet, even so, my schoolfellows still came to peer inside my mind. One of them even asked when I would be back.",CO213CL08
20724,57,"“On Saturday, my dear,” said my mother, when I repeated this imagined question. “Although, since the mass will be on Friday, perhaps it would be best if you went back on the Monday.”",CO213CL08
20725,58,"“I’d prefer Saturday,” I said.",CO213CL08
20726,59,"“As you wish,” she said.",CO213CL08
20727,60,"She didn’t smile, but if she’d been able to, she would have smiled with pleasure to see that I actually wanted to return to school earlier. And since she knew how I hated school, I wonder what she made of this sudden eagerness on my part. She probably attributed some loftier meaning to it, a message from heaven or from her husband. And if you’re reading this with a smile on your face, I certainly wasn’t idle during that time.",CO213CL08
20728,61,"No, I had no rest, because my mother made me study, and I not only hated studying, I hated having to be seated, with the book in my hands, in a corner or at the table. I cursed the book, the table, and the chair. I resorted to something that I heartily recommend to other idle boys: I left my eyes on the page and opened the door to my imagination. I ran to snatch up skyrockets, to listen to hurdy-gurdies, to dance with girls, to sing, to laugh, to have fights, whether pretend or in play, whichever is the more appropriate term.",CO213CL08
20729,62,"Once, when my mother found me in the parlor without my book, she told me off, but I explained that I’d been thinking about my father. This explanation made her cry, and it wasn’t a complete lie on my part, either, for I had been remembering the last little gift he gave me, and I could see him with it in his hand.",CO213CL08
20730,63,"Felícia lived as sadly as I did, but, I must confess, the main cause of her sadness was not the same as mine. She liked to play, too, but she didn’t really miss playing, she spent all her time with our mother, sewing with her, and, once, I even saw her wiping away her tears. Slightly annoyed, I considered imitating her, and put my hand in my pocket to take out my handkerchief. My hand entered my pocket with no real feeling and, finding no handkerchief there, withdrew with no real regret. I think that my gesture lacked not only originality, but sincerity too.",CO213CL08
20731,64,"Don’t think badly of me. I was genuinely sad during those long, silent, reclusive days. Once, I decided to go into the store, which had opened again immediately after the funeral, and where the clerk continued to work. I could talk to him, watch him selling cotton and needles, measuring out ribbons, or I could go to the door, out onto the sidewalk, even as far as the street corner . . .",CO213CL08
20732,65,"My mother smothered that dream soon after it was born, sending the slave-woman to fetch me and bring me back into the house to study. I tore at my hair, clenched my fists like someone about to land a punch, and, possibly, even wept with rage.",CO213CL08
20733,66,"The book I was studying reminded me of school, and the image of school consoled me. I was really missing it by then. I could see from afar the faces of the other boys, the silly expressions we all put on as we sat at our desks, and our sheer glee as we gamboled home. I felt on my face one of those little paper pellets we used to provoke each other with, and I made one of my own and threw it at my imaginary provoker.",CO213CL08
20734,67,"As often happened, the pellet hit someone else’s head, and he soon took his revenge, although when it hit one of the shyer boys, he would merely pull a face. It wasn’t proper fun, but it was enough. The exile I had so blithely abandoned when Uncle Zeca came to fetch me seemed to me now like a remote heaven, and I was afraid of losing it.",CO213CL08
20735,68,"There was no gaiety at home, hardly a word spoken, barely a movement made. It was around this time that I started drawing endless cats in the margins of my schoolbook, cats and pigs. They didn’t exactly cheer me up, but they were a distraction.",CO213CL08
20736,69,"The seventh-day mass restored me to the street. As it happened, I didn’t go back to school on the Saturday, I went to my godfather’s house, where I was free to talk a little more, and on the Sunday, I was allowed to stand outside the shop door.",CO213CL08
20737,70,"This wasn’t complete happiness, though. Complete happiness came on Monday, at school. I arrived all dressed in black and the other boys eyed me curiously, but it felt so different to be back beside my schoolfellows that I forgot that joyless holiday and discovered instead a different joy, with not a holiday in sight.",CO213CL08

20745,8,"Uncle Zeca went over to the schoolmaster and spoke to him in a whisper. The schoolmaster had him take a seat, looked in my direction, and, I think, asked him something, because Uncle Zeca started speaking slowly, very demonstratively. The schoolmaster insisted, and my uncle responded until the schoolmaster, turning toward me, said out loud:",CO213CL10
20746,9,"“Senhor José Martins, you are excused.”",CO213CL10
20747,10,"My feeling of joy was such that it overcame my surprise. I was just ten years old—I liked to play; I didn’t like to study. A call from home, my uncle in person, my father’s brother, who had arrived from Guaratiba the evening before, naturally meant some party, an outing, something or other.",CO213CL10
20748,11,"I ran to get my hat, put the reader in my pocket, and went down the stairs from the school, a small two-story building on Rua do Senado. In the hall, I kissed Uncle Zeca’s hand. In the street, I walked by his side, taking quick steps and looking up. He didn’t say anything to me; I didn’t dare ask him any questions. A little later we made it to my sister Felícia’s school. He told me to wait; he went in, went up, came down, and the three of us headed home.",CO213CL10
20749,12,"My joy was greater now. There had to be some celebration at home, since the two of us, she and I, were on our way; we were in the lead, asking each other questions and making guesses. Maybe Uncle Zeca’s birthday. I turned toward him; he had his eyes on the ground, probably to keep from falling.",CO213CL10

My godfather was running for city council; even though I didn’t really know what being a candidate or the city council was, I had heard so much about the coming win that I considered it a sure thing.",CO213CL10
20766,29,"I didn’t know the election was on Sunday, and it was Friday. I imagined musicians, cheers and clapping, and we children running around, laughing, eating cocadas. Maybe there would be a show at night; I went nearly giddy. I had gone once to the theater, and I had fallen asleep on the way back, but the next day I was so happy I was dying to go there again, even though I hadn’t understand any of what I had heard. I had certainly seen a lot, though, luxurious chairs, thrones, long spears, scenes that changed before my eyes, going from a parlor to a forest and from the forest to a street.",CO213CL10
20767,30,"Then, the characters, all princes. That was what we called the people who wore silk breeches, shoes with buckles or boots, swords, velvet caps, plumed hats. There had been dancing, too. The dancers spoke with their feet and their hands, changing position, and they were constantly smiling. Then the shouts from the audience and the clapping. . . .",CO213CL10
20768,31,"I’ve written clapping twice now; it’s that I was very familiar with it. Felícia, whom I mentioned the possibility of a show to, didn’t seem to me to go in much for it, but she didn’t dismiss it, either. She would go to the theater. And who knows if there might not be a puppet show at home? We were making these guesses when Uncle Zeca told us to wait; he had stopped to talk with somebody.",CO213CL10
20769,32,"We stopped to wait. The thought of the party, whatever it might be, kept on exciting us, me more than her. I imagined thirty thousand things, without getting to the bottom of a single one, in such a rush did they come, and so confusing that I couldn’t make them out—it’s possible even that the same ones came again and again.",CO213CL10
20770,33,"Felícia drew my attention to two black kids wearing red hoods who were going by carrying cane—a sight that reminded us of the Saint Anthony and Saint John’s Nights, already gone by at that point. I talked to her then about the bonfires in our yard, about the logs we burned, about the pistols, and about the dances with other children. If only there were going to be the same thing now!",CO213CL10

The donkeys had stopped, on their own, I think, since they knew Uncle Zeca, too, an idea that Felícia dismissed with a gesture and that I defended with a laugh.

20783,46,"Our house was on the next street, near the corner. As we turned the corner, we saw the doorway to the house lined in black, a sight that filled us with dread. Instinctively, we stopped and looked around at Uncle Zeca. He came over to us, gave us each a hand, and was about to say something, but it got caught in his throat; he went ahead, taking us with him.",CO213CL10
20784,47,"When we arrived, the doors were half closed. I don’t know if I told you it was a shop. In the street, onlookers. In the windows opposite and to the side, clusters of heads. There was a bit of a stir when we arrived. It’s only natural that I, like Felícia, had my mouth hanging open. Uncle Zeca pushed one of the double doors. The three of us went in; he closed it again, went into the hall, and we went to the dining room and the bedroom.",CO213CL10
20785,48,"Inside, at the foot of the bed, was my mother with her head in her hands. Informed of our arrival, she leaped up, came to hug us in tears, crying out:",CO213CL10
20786,49,"“My children, your father died!”",CO213CL10
20787,50,"The shock was huge, however much confusion and vagueness retarded our understanding of the news. I didn’t have the strength to walk, and I was afraid to. Dead how? Dead why? If I place these two questions here, it’s to go on with the story; just then, I didn’t ask myself or anyone else anything.",CO213CL10
20788,51,"I heard my mother’s words; within me, I heard them again, as well as her sobs, which were huge. She took us and pulled us to the bed, where her husband’s body was lying; and she had us kiss his hand. I was so far from imagining that death that, in spite of it all, I hadn’t understood anything at first; the sadness and the silence of the people around the bed help me understand my father had really died.",CO213CL10
20789,52,"It wasn’t a saint’s day, with fun and games; it wasn’t a party; they weren’t the hours, long or short, for people to spin through the house, freed of the discipline of school. That that collapse of such a beautiful dream intensified my filial grief is something I can’t confirm or deny; better is to keep quiet. My father was there dead, with no playing, dancing, laughing, musicians, things all dead themselves, too. If I had been told on the way out from school why I was being picked up, joy obviously wouldn’t have filled my heart, from which it was now being punched out.",CO213CL10
20790,53,"The funeral was the next day at nine in the morning, and that friend of Uncle Zeca’s who had taken his leave in the street, promising to show up at nine o’clock, was probably there. I didn’t see the rites; a few figures, not too many, dressed in black, I remember I did see. My godfather, owner of a small sugar mill, was there, as well as his wife, who took me to a back bedroom to show me some pictures. On the way out, I heard my mother’s cries, the sound of footsteps, a word or two—“turn around,” I think; “more to the left”; “make sure you’ve got it”—muttered by the people taking the coffin handles. Then, in the distance, the moving hearse and the gigs behind it. . . .",CO213CL10
20791,54,"There went my father and the holidays! A day off without merriment! No, it wasn’t a day—it was a week, a week of mourning, during which I thought of school a time or two. My mother cried, sewing mourning dress, between one bereavement visit and another. I cried, too; I didn’t see my father at the usual times, hear his words at the table or at the counter, or the endearments he used with the birds. Because he loved birds, and he had three or four in cages.",CO213CL10
20792,55,"My mother kept quiet. It was almost as if only people from outside spoke. That was how I found out that my father had died of apoplexy. I heard that information several times; visitors asked about the cause of death, and she told the whole story—the time of day, the gesture, the occasion. He had gone to get a drink of water, and was filling a glass at the back window. I learned it all by heart, so often did I hear it told.",CO213CL10
20793,56,And yet the boys from school didn’t stop coming to peer out from in my memory. One of them even asked me when I would be going back.,CO213CL10
20794,57,"“Saturday, my son,” said my mother, when I repeated the imagined question. “The mass is on Friday. Maybe it will be better to go back Monday.”",CO213CL10
20795,58,"“Better Saturday,” I said.",CO213CL10
20796,59,"“All right, then,” she concurred.",CO213CL10
20797,60,"She wasn’t smiling; if she could have, she would have smiled with joy on seeing that I wanted to go back to school sooner. But since she knew I didn’t like to study, how would she understand my preference? She probably accorded it some higher meaning, advice from providence or her husband. In fact, I wasn’t enjoying myself, if by enjoyment you understand having fun.",CO213CL10
20798,61,"It didn’t have anything to do with taking a break, either, because my mother made me study, and the position studying put me in annoyed me as much as studying itself. Obliged to stay still with the book in hand in a corner or at the table, I said the hell with the book, the table, and the chair. I resorted to a method I recommend to the lazy: I would leave my eyes on the page and open the door to the imagination. I would run to gather the arrows from sky-rockets, listen to barrel organs, dance with girls, sing, laugh, land fake or playful blows, as you prefer.",CO213CL10
20799,62,"Once, when on going into the parlor she saw me not reading, my mother scolded me, and I replied that I was thinking about my father. The explanation made her cry, and in fact it wasn’t a complete lie; I had remembered the last little present he had given me, and I started seeing him with it in his hand.",CO213CL10
20800,63,"Felícia was as glum as I was, but I’ll admit it—the main reason wasn’t the same. She liked to play, but she didn’t miss not playing; she didn’t spend time with our mother, sewing with her, and once I found her drying her eyes. Slightly humiliated, I thought about copying her, and I put my hand in my pocket to pull out my handkerchief. My hand went in without gentleness, and, not finding the handkerchief, it came out without chagrin. I think the gesture was lacking not only originality but also sincerity.",CO213CL10
20801,64,"Don’t upbraid me. For long days, silent and sequestered, I was sincere. Once I wanted to go to the shop, which opened after the funeral, and where the assistant went on working. I would talk with him, watch the sale of needles and thread, the measuring of ribbons—I’d go to the door, the sidewalk, the street corner. . . .",CO213CL10
20802,65,"My mother stifled this dream shortly after it had taken shape. Hardly had I made to the counter than she had the slave come get me; at that point, I went back into the house and to my schoolwork. I despaired; I clenched my fist like someone wants to throw a punch; I don’t remember if I cried with rage.",CO213CL10
20803,66,"The book reminded me of school, and the image of school comforted me. I was already missing it a lot by then. From a long way away, I saw the faces of the boys, our gestures of mockery in our seats, and our bounds on the way out. I felt on my face one of those little wads of paper we roused each other with, and I made one of my own and launched it at my presumed rouser.",CO213CL10
20804,67,"The little wad, as sometimes happened, landed on the head of a third boy, who quickly retaliated. Some, more timid, settled for making faces. It wasn’t outright merrymaking, but it was close enough. That land of banishment I had been so happy to leave with Uncle Zeca now struck me as a distant paradise, and I was afraid of losing it.",CO213CL10
20805,68,"No joy at home, few words, little movement. It was around that time that I penciled the most cats in the margins of my reader; cats and pigs. It wasn’t much fun, but it was a distraction.",CO213CL10
20806,69,"The seventh-day mass gave me back the street. I didn’t go to school on Saturday; I went to my godfather’s house, where I could talk a bit more, and Sunday I was at the door to the shop.",CO213CL10
20807,70,"It wasn’t complete happiness. Complete happiness was Monday, at school. I went in wearing black; I was looked at with curiosity, but, by comparison with my classmates, so much differently that I thought no more of my joyless holidays and found great happiness without holidays.",CO213CL10

20809,2,"Ignacio trembled as he heard the lawyer’s shouts, took the plate he was given and tried to eat under a cloudburst of names: layabout, day-dreamer, fool, nutcase.",CO173CL04
20810,3,"‘Where’s your brain gone? Why do you never hear a word I say? I’ll tell your father everything, so he can beat the laziness out of your body with a good quince cane or a stick; yes, you’re not too old for a beating, don’t think you are! Fool! Nutcase!’",CO173CL04
20811,4,"‘He’s just the same out there as he is here,’ he went on, turning to Dona Severina, a lady who’d been living with him, maritally so to speak, for years.",CO173CL04
20812,5,"‘He gets all my papers mixed up, goes to the wrong addresses, goes to one notary when he should go to another, mixes up lawyers’ names – it’s murder! It’s this doze he’s in all the time. In the mornings, that’s the way it is; you need to break his bones to wake him up … leave it to me; tomorrow I’ll wake him with a broomstick!’",CO173CL04
20813,6,"Dona Severina prodded Borges gently with her foot, as if asking him to stop. He spat out a few more insults, then settled down, at peace with man and God.",CO173CL04
20814,7,"I’ll not say he was at peace with children, because our friend Ignacio was not exactly a child. He was fifteen, and looked every bit of it. The head was handsome, with its dishevelled hair and the dreamy, inquisitive eyes of a lad who questions, searches and never quite finds – all this crowning a body not without charm, even if it was badly dressed.",CO173CL04
20815,8,"His father’s a barber in Cidade Nova, and placed him as an agent, scribe, clerk, or something of the sort with Borges the lawyer, hoping he’d rise in the world, because he thought barristers got a lot of money. All this took place in the Rua da Lapa, in 1870.",CO173CL04
20816,9,"For some minutes there was nothing more than the clink of knives and forks and the noise of chewing. Borges stuffed himself with beef and lettuce; he punctuated the flow with a slug of wine, and carried on in silence.",CO173CL04
20817,10,"Ignacio went on eating slowly, not daring to lift his eyes from the plate or put them where they were at the moment the terrible Borges took off at him. The truth is that at this moment it would be very risky. If he so much as let his eyes wander to Dona Severina’s arms he’d forget himself, and everything else too.",CO173CL04
20818,11,"It was, truly, Dona Severina’s fault, going round with them bare all the time. All her indoor dresses had short sleeves, which stopped a few inches below her shoulder; from that point on her arms were on show.",CO173CL04
20819,12,"They really were lovely and rounded, in harmony with the lady herself, more plump than she was thin, and they lost none of their colour or softness by exposure to the open air; but it is fair to explain that she didn’t wear them that way to show off, but because she’d already worn out all her long-sleeved dresses. When she was standing she was very striking; when she walked she swayed in a funny way; Ignacio, however, almost never saw her except at table, where, beyond her arms, he could hardly even see her bust.",CO173CL04
20820,13,"You can’t say she was pretty; but she wasn’t ugly either. She wore no ornament; even her hair was simply arranged; she smoothed, gathered, and tied and fixed it on top of her head with the tortoiseshell comb her mother had left her. At her throat was a dark neckerchief; in her ears, nothing. Her twenty-seven years were solid and in full bloom.",CO173CL04
20821,14,"They finished dining. Borges, when the coffee came, took four cigars out of his pocket, compared them, pressed them between his fingers, chose one and put the others back. With his cigar lit, he placed his elbows on the table and spoke to Dona Severina of thirty thousand things that had no interest for our young friend; but while Borges was speaking, he wasn’t lambasting him, and he could dream at leisure.",CO173CL04
20822,15,"Ignacio made the coffee last as long as he could. Between one sip and the next, he smoothed the cloth down, picked imaginary pieces of skin off his fingers, or let his eyes wander round the pictures in the dining room, which were two, one of St Peter, the other of St John, devotional pictures bought at festival time and framed at home.",CO173CL04
20823,16,"We can believe he could disguise his thoughts with St John, whose young head brings cheer to Catholic imaginations; but with the austere St Peter it is going a bit far. Ignacio’s only defence is that he saw neither one nor the other. All he saw was Dona Severina’s arms – either because he took a sly look at them, or because they were imprinted on his memory.",CO173CL04
20824,17,"‘Come on, man! Are you never going to finish?’ the lawyer shouted suddenly.",CO173CL04
20825,18,"There was no help for it; Ignacio drank the last cold drop and retired, as usual, to his room at the back of the house. As he went in he made a gesture of anger and despair, and later went to lean out of one of the two windows looking over the sea.",CO173CL04
20826,19,"Five minutes later, the sight of the water nearby and the far-off mountains gave him a confused, vague, restless feeling, painful and pleasurable at the same time, like something a plant must feel when its first flower comes into bud. He wanted to leave, and he wanted to stay. He’d been there for five weeks, and life was the same every day, out in the morning with Borges, going round courts and notaries, running round, taking papers to be stamped, to the post, to scribes and officials.",CO173CL04
20827,20,"He came back in the afternoon, had lunch and went to his room until supper-time; he had his supper and went to bed. Borges didn’t admit him into the family circle, which consisted only of Dona Severina, and Ignacio saw her no more than three times a day, at meals. Five weeks of solitude, of drudgery, far from his mother and sisters; five weeks of silence, because he only said anything once or twice in the street; in the house, he never said a word.",CO173CL04
20828,21,"‘You’ll see,’ he thought one day, ‘I’ll run away from here and not come back.’",CO173CL04
20829,22,"He didn’t; he felt bound and chained to Dona Severina’s arms. He’d never seen any as pretty and as fresh. His upbringing didn’t allow him to look at them openly; it seems, in fact, that at the beginning he withdrew his eyes in embarrassment. He began to look little by little, once he saw that they never had sleeves to cover them, and he gradually discovered them, looking and loving.",CO173CL04
20830,23,"At the end of three weeks they were, morally speaking, the tents where he took his repose. He put up with all the work in town, all the melancholy of solitude and silence, and all his boss’s rude abuse, just for the reward of seeing, three times a day, the famous pair of arms.",CO173CL04
20831,24,"That day, when night was falling and Ignacio was stretching out in his hammock (he had no other bed), Dona Severina, in the front room, was thinking over the dinner episode and, for the first time, she suspected something. She rejected the idea immediately – he was only a boy!",CO173CL04
20832,25,"But there are ideas akin to insistent flies: the more we beat them off, the more they come back and alight on us. A boy? He was fifteen; and she noticed that between the lad’s nose and mouth there was the beginning of a sketch of fuzz. Was it so astonishing that he was beginning to fall in love? And wasn’t she pretty?",CO173CL04
20833,26,"This last idea wasn’t rejected; rather it was caressed and kissed. Then she remembered his demeanour, his distracted air, his oversights – one incident after another; these were all symptoms, and she thought yes, it was true.",CO173CL04
20834,27,"‘What’s the matter with you?’ said the lawyer to her, stretching out on the settee, after a few minutes’ silence.",CO173CL04
20835,28,‘Me? Nothing.’,CO173CL04
20836,29,"‘Nothing? It seems everything’s asleep in this house! Leave it to me, I know a good medicine for waking sleepyheads …’",CO173CL04
20837,30,"And so he went on, in the same angry tone, firing off threats, but in fact incapable of carrying them out, for he was more of a loudmouth than a truly nasty man. Dona Severina kept telling him no, he was mistaken, she wasn’t asleep, she was thinking about her good friend Fortunata. They hadn’t been to see her since Christmas; why didn’t they go over there some night soon?",CO173CL04
20838,31,"Borges replied that he was tired all the time, working like a black man, and he’d no time for idle chat; and he attacked Fortunata, her husband, and their son, who wasn’t going to school, at the age of ten! He, Borges, when he was ten, already knew how to read, write and do his sums, not very well, it’s true, but at least he knew. Ten! He’d come to a good end: a good-for-nothing, he’d be press-ganged in no time. Life in the army would teach him a lesson.",CO173CL04
20839,32,"Dona Severina soothed him with excuses, Fortunata’s poverty, her husband’s bad luck, and caressed him a little fearfully, in case the caresses irritated him some more. It was completely dark; she heard the click of the gas lamp, which had just come on, and saw its glimmer in the windows of the house over the street. Borges, tired out after his day, for he really did work very hard, closed his eyes and started to drop off. He left her in the room, in the dark, alone with herself and the discovery she’d just made.",CO173CL04
20840,33,"Everything seemed to tell the lady it was true; but this truth, once she’d got over the surprise, brought with it a moral complication, which she only recognised by its effects; she couldn’t put her finger on what it was. She couldn’t understand herself or settle down, and even thought of telling the lawyer everything, so that he would send the youngster away.",CO173CL04
20841,34,"But what did it all amount to? Here she stopped in her tracks: in reality, there was nothing more than supposition, coincidence and possibly illusion. No, no, it wasn’t an illusion. Then she started piecing together the vague clues, the lad’s attitudes, his shyness, his distractedness, till she rejected the idea that she was mistaken.",CO173CL04
20842,35,"In a short while (O perfidious nature!), reflecting that it would be wrong to accuse him baselessly, she admitted she might be deluded, with the single aim of observing him better and seeing what was really going on.",CO173CL04
20843,36,"That very night, Dona Severina looked from under her eyelids at Ignacio’s gestures; she saw nothing, because tea didn’t take long, and the lad didn’t take his eyes off the cup. The next day she was able to observe him better, and later still, extremely well.",CO173CL04
20844,37,"She saw it was true, she was loved and feared, with an adolescent, virginal love, held back by social ties and a feeling of inferiority which prevented him from understanding himself. Dona Severina realised that she need fear no misdemeanour, and concluded it was better to say nothing to the lawyer; she would save him from one nasty surprise, and the poor child from another.",CO173CL04
20845,38,"She was already persuading herself that he was a child, and determined to treat him as coolly as she had done till now, or even more so. So she did; Ignacio began to feel that her eyes avoided his, or she spoke sharply, almost as much so as Borges himself. It is true that at other times her tone of voice came out quite soft and even gentle, very gentle; in just the same way her look, generally elusive, wandered elsewhere so much that, just to find some rest, it would sometimes alight on his head; but all this was fleeting.",CO173CL04
20846,39,"‘I’m going to leave,’ he repeated in the street, as he had when he was first there.",CO173CL04
20847,40,"But he’d come back to the house, and he didn’t leave. Dona Severina’s arms formed a parenthesis in the middle of the long and tedious sentence of the life he was leading, and this inserted phrase had an original and profound idea embedded in it, invented by Heaven only for him. He stayed and carried on as before. In the end, however, he had to leave, and for good; here’s how and why.",CO173CL04
20848,41,"Dona Severina had been treating him with some benevolence. The roughness in her voice seemed to have disappeared, and there was more than softness, there was care and affection. One day she would tell him to keep out of draughts, another that he shouldn’t drink cold water after hot coffee, reminders, advice, the considerate thoughts of a friend and mother, which threw his soul into even greater anxiety and confusion.",CO173CL04
20849,42,"Ignacio grew so confident of himself that he laughed one day at the table, something he’d never done; and the lawyer didn’t berate him this time, because it was he who was telling a funny story, and no one punishes anyone for applauding them. It was then that Dona Severina saw that the boy’s mouth, charming when he was silent, was no less charming when he laughed.",CO173CL04
20850,43,"Ignacio’s agitation grew; he couldn’t keep calm or understand what was happening to him. Nowhere did he feel easy. He’d wake up at night, thinking about Dona Severina. In the street, he would take wrong turnings, go to the wrong doors, much more than before, and he couldn’t set eyes on a woman, nearby or far off, who didn’t remind him of her.",CO173CL04
20851,44,"When he entered the house along the corridor as he returned from work, he always felt some excitement; sometimes a great deal, when he saw her at the top of the stairs, looking at him through the wooden slats of the door, as if having come to see who it was.",CO173CL04
20852,45,"One Sunday – he never forgot that Sunday – he was alone in his room, at the window, looking at the sea, which was whispering the same obscure new language as Dona Severina. He amused himself watching the gulls describing circles in the air, alighting on the water or simply fluttering round. It was a beautiful day. It wasn’t just a Christian Sunday; it was an immense, universal Sunday.",CO173CL04
20853,46,"Ignacio always spent these days there in his room or looking out of the window, or rereading one of the three little books he’d brought with him, stories of times past, bought for next to nothing under the archway in the Largo do Paço. It was two in the afternoon.",CO173CL04
20854,47,"He was tired, he’d slept badly, having walked around a great deal the previous day; he stretched out in the hammock, picked up one of the books, Princess Magalona, and began reading. He’d never been able to understand why all the heroines in these old stories had the same face and figure as Dona Severina, but the fact was that they had.",CO173CL04
20855,48,"After half an hour, he let the book drop and stared at the wall, from where, five minutes later, he saw the mistress of his thoughts emerge. He should have been astonished; but he wasn’t. Even though his lids were shut, he saw her detach herself completely, stop, smile, and walk towards the hammock. It was she; those were her arms.",CO173CL04
20856,49,"The truth is, however, that not only could Dona Severina not have emerged from the wall, supposing there to have been a door or a fissure there – but she was in the front room, listening to the lawyer’s footsteps as he went downstairs. She heard him go down; she went to the window and only came back when he’d disappeared into the distance, on his way to the Rua das Mangueiras.",CO173CL04
20857,50,"Then she came in and went to sit on the settee. She seemed out of sorts, restless, almost manic; getting up, she went to pick up a jar on the sideboard and put it back where it had been; then she walked as far as the door, stopped and turned back, for no reason at all, it seems.",CO173CL04
20858,51,"She sat down again, for five or ten minutes. Suddenly, she remembered that Ignacio hadn’t eaten much at breakfast and looked a bit downcast. It occurred to her he might be ill – maybe he was very ill indeed.",CO173CL04
20859,52,"She went out of the door, hurriedly crossed the corridor and went to the lad’s room, finding the door wide open. Dona Severina stopped, peeped in, and saw him in the hammock, asleep, with his arm hanging down and the book on the floor. His head was turned a little towards the door, so one could see his eyes were closed; his hair was tousled and he had a smiling, blissful look about him.",CO173CL04
20860,53,"Dona Severina’s heart beat violently, and she drew back. She had dreamed of him the previous night; maybe he was dreaming about her now. Since daybreak, the lad’s image had been floating in front of her eyes like a temptation of the devil. She drew back further, then came forward again, and looked for two, three, five minutes or more.",CO173CL04
20861,54,"It seems sleep gave an emphasis to Ignacio’s adolescence, an almost feminine, childlike expression. A child! she said to herself, in that wordless language we all have within us. This idea slowed the rush of blood to her heart and partially calmed her agitated feelings.",CO173CL04
20862,55,‘A child!’,CO173CL04
20863,56,"She looked him over slowly, surfeited herself with looking at him, with his head bent to one side, his arm drooping; but, at the same time as she found him childlike, she found him handsome, much more than when he was awake, and one of these notions corrected or corrupted the other.",CO173CL04
20864,57,"Suddenly she shuddered and drew back in shock: she’d heard a noise nearby, in the ironing closet. She went to look – a cat had knocked a bowl on to the floor. Slowly, quietly coming back to look at him, she saw he was in a deep sleep. How soundly the boy slept! The noise that had given her such a fright hadn’t even made him change position. And she went on looking at him sleeping – sleeping, dreaming, who knows?",CO173CL04
20865,58,"How sad we can’t see each other’s dreams! Dona Severina would have seen herself in the boy’s imagination; she would have seen herself standing by the hammock, smiling and motionless; then leaning over, taking his hands, lifting them to her chest and enfolding them in her arms, her wondrous arms.",CO173CL04
20866,59,"Ignacio, fond as he was of her arms, even so heard her words, which were beautiful, warm, and above all new – or, at least, they belonged to some language he didn’t know, even though he understood it.",CO173CL04
20867,60,"Two, three, four times the figure faded away, only to return, coming from the sea or somewhere else, flying with the gulls, and crossing the corridor, with all the robust charm she was capable of. And coming back, she leaned over, took his hands in hers again and folded her arms across her chest, until, leaning over further, much further, she pursed her lips and gave him a kiss on the mouth.",CO173CL04
20868,61,"Here the dream coincided with reality, and the same mouths were united in the imagination and outside it. The difference is that the vision did not draw back, and the real person had no sooner completed this movement than she fled to the door, ashamed and afraid.",CO173CL04
20869,62,"From there she went to the front room, stunned by what she had done, unable to fix her eyes on anything. Her ears were on stalks, she went to the end of the corridor to see if she could hear any noise that might tell her he was awake, and only after a long time did the fear begin to subside. It really was true that the lad slept soundly; nothing would open his eyes, whether it was a nearby crash, or a real kiss.",CO173CL04
20870,63,"But, if the fear faded, her shame stayed and grew. Dona Severina couldn’t believe she’d done a thing like that; it seems she’d wrapped up her desires in the idea that in front of her was an adoring child, unconscious and blameless; and half-mother, half-friend, she had leaned over and kissed him. However that may be, she was confused, irritated, annoyed at herself and at him. The fear that he might be pretending he was asleep surfaced in her soul and made her shiver.",CO173CL04
20871,64,"But the truth is that he slept for much longer, and only woke for supper. He sat eagerly down at the table. Although he found Dona Severina silent and severe and the lawyer as sharp as ever, neither the sharpness nor the severity could dissolve the charming scene he still had in his mind, nor could they dull the sensation of the kiss.",CO173CL04

20882,3,“What’s wrong with you that you never listen to what I say to you? I’ll tell your father everything so he can smack that laziness out of your body with a good quince switch or a rod; you better believe you could still get a whipping. You fool! You lunatic!”,CO170CL08

An unschooled but fine head, the eyes of a questioning, prescient young dreamer who wants to know and ends up never knowing anything. All set on a body not devoid of grace, though badly dressed.",CO170CL08
20887,8,"His father is a barber in Cidade Nova and had placed him as a runner, clerk, or what have you with the lawyer Borges, in hopes of seeing him in court, as it seemed to him that trial lawyers made good money. This was on Rua da Lapa, in 1870.",CO170CL08
20888,9,For several minutes you could hear nothing but the clinking of flatware and the sound of chewing. Borges stuffed himself with lettuce and beef; he interrupted himself to punctuate this expression with a swallow of wine and then went on again in silence.,CO170CL08
20889,10,"Inácio was eating slowly, not daring to lift his gaze from his plate or let it rest on the spot where it had been when the fearsome Borges tore into him. The truth is, it would now be very risky. Never did he let his gaze fall on dona Severina’s arms without his forgetting himself and everything else.",CO170CL08
20890,11,"It was dona Severina’s fault for always having them bare, too. All of her house dresses had short sleeves, no more than a couple of inches below the shoulder; from there down her arms were on show.",CO170CL08
20891,12,"To tell the truth, they were beautiful and plump, in harmony with the lady herself, who was thicker than she was slender, and even though they were always out in the air they didn’t lose their color or their softness; but it is only fair to note that she didn’t show them that way out of vanity, but because she had worn out all of her long-sleeved dresses. Standing up, she was very pleasing to look at; walking, she swayed nicely. For his part, he saw her just about only at the table, where, apart from her arms, he could hardly look at her bust.",CO170CL08
20892,13,"You couldn’t say she was pretty, but neither was she ugly. No finery. Her hairdo was very simple; she combed her haired, gathered it, put a knot in it, and kept it over her head with the tortoise-shell comb her mother had left her. A dark scarf around her neck and nothing on her ears. All in twenty-seven well turned and solid years.",CO170CL08
20893,14,"They finished eating. When the coffee came, Borges took four cigars from his pocket, compared them, squeezed them, chose one, and put away the others. Once the cigar was lit, he put his elbows on the table and spoke to dona Severina about thirty thousand things that had nothing whatever to do with our Inácio. But while he spoke he was not insulting him, and he could daydream to his heart’s content.",CO170CL08
20894,15,"Inácio made the coffee last as long as he could. Between sips, he smoothed the tablecloth, picked imaginary little pieces of skin off of his fingers, or turned his gaze on the two paintings in the dining room, one of Saint Peter and one of Saint John, prints acquired on holy days and framed at home.",CO170CL08
20895,16,"Let him dissemble with Saint John, whose young head delights Catholic imaginations, but the austere Saint Peter was too much. Young Inácio’s only defense is that he was seeing neither one nor the other; he was turning his gaze on them as if on nothing. He was seeing only dona Severina’s arms—either because he was taking surreptitious glances at them or because they were imprinted on his memory.",CO170CL08
20896,17,"“Man, are you never going to finish?” the lawyer suddenly shouted.",CO170CL08
20897,18,"There was nothing doing. Inácio drank the last drop, cold by then, and, as usual, went to his room at the back of the house. As he went in, he gestured in anger and despair and then went to stretch out by one of the two windows overlooking the ocean.",CO170CL08
20898,19,"Five minutes later, the view of the water nearby and the mountains in the distance brought back to him the obscure, vague, restless feeling that hurt him and made him feel good, something a plant must feel when it first buds. He wanted to leave and to go. He had been living there for five weeks, and life was always the same, mornings going out with Borges, visiting courtrooms and registry offices, running, taking papers to be stamped, to the process server, to clerks of the court, to bailiffs.",CO170CL08
20899,20,"He came back in the afternoon, had lunch, and went to his room until suppertime; he had supper and went to bed. Borges didn’t include him in the life of the family, the only other member of which was dona Severina, and Inácio didn’t see her more than three times a day, either, at meals. Five weeks of loneliness, of joyless work, far from his mother and his sisters; five weeks of silence, since he spoke only now and again in the street; nothing in the house.",CO170CL08
20900,21,"“Forget it,” he thought one day, “I’ll run away and never come back.”",CO170CL08
20901,22,"He didn’t; he felt gripped and fettered by dona Severina’s arms. He had never seen another pair as pretty or as fresh. The upbringing he had had did not allow him to look openly at them, and at first, miffed, he seemed even to look away. He took to gazing at them little by little, seeing they had no other sleeves, and thus he ended up discovering, eyeing, and loving them.",CO170CL08
20902,23,"Three weeks later they were, morally speaking, his rest tents. He put up with all of the toil outside, all of the gloom of loneliness and silence, all of the master’s coarseness, for the sole reward of seeing, three times a day, the famous pair of arms.",CO170CL08
20903,24,"That day, as night fell and Inácio stretched out in the hammock (he had no other bed there), dona Severina, in the front room, went back over the incident at dinner and, for the first time, she suspected something. She immediately dismissed the thought: a child!",CO170CL08
20904,25,"But there are thoughts that are of the ilk of stubborn flies: no matter how often you shoo them away, they come back to land. A child? He was fifteen years old, and she had noticed that there were the beginnings of a mustache between his nose and his mouth. Why would it be so astonishing if he were in love? And was she not pretty?",CO170CL08
20905,26,"This thought was not dismissed; instead, it was cherished and embraced. And then she recalled his manner, his spells of forgetfulness, his absentmindedness, and one incident after another—all were symptoms, and she concluded that he was indeed in love.",CO170CL08
20906,27,"“What’s with you?” the lawyer, lying on the couch, asked her after a pause of several minutes.",CO170CL08
20907,28,“Nothing.,CO170CL08
20908,29,“Nothing? Everyone here at home seems to be sleeping. Just you wait. I know of a good way of getting sleepyheads up. . . .”,CO170CL08
20909,30,"And he went on in the same angry tone, issuing threats but in fact incapable of making good on them, since he was more vulgar than cruel. Dona Severina interrupted him to tell him that no, that it was an illusion, she wasn’t sleeping, she was thinking about her godson’s mother, Fortunata. They hadn’t visited her since Christmas. Why didn’t they go there one of these evenings?",CO170CL08
20910,31,"Borges replied that he was tired, that he worked like a slave, that he wasn’t one for paying courtesy calls to make a lot of small talk, and he lit into the godmother, he lit into the godfather, he lit into the godson, who, at ten years old, wasn’t going to school. He, Borges, at ten, already knew how to read, write, and add and subtract, not very well, to be sure, but he knew. Ten years old! He would come to a fine end—an idler, and into a military uniform with him. Barracks life would teach him.",CO170CL08
20911,32,"Dona Severina placated him with excuses, the godmother’s poverty, the godfather’s ill luck, and she caressed him, afraid that the caresses might irritate him even more. Night had fallen; she heard the tlic of the gas lamp that had just been lit in the street and saw its light reflected in the windows of the house across the street. Borges, tired from the day, since he really was a worker of the first rank, was closing his eyes bit by bit and dropping off, and he left her alone in the living room, in the dark, with herself and with the discovery she had just made.",CO170CL08
20912,33,"Everything seemed to tell the lady that it was true; but this truth, once she had gotten over her astonishment, created a moral complication for her whose effects alone she recognized, since she couldn’t come up with a way of discerning what it was. She couldn’t understand herself or put herself at ease; she thought even of telling the lawyer everything and having him send the brat away.",CO170CL08
20913,34,"But what was everything? Here she stopped short: there was really nothing more than conjecture, coincidence, and a possible illusion. No, no, it wasn’t an illusion. And then she went back over vague signs, the kid’s behavior, his shyness, his absentmindedness, only to dismiss the thought that she was mistaken.",CO170CL08
20914,35,"A bit later (perverse nature!), thinking that it would be wrong to accuse him for no reason, she admitted—for the sole purpose of watching him more closely and finding out where things stood—that she might be deceiving herself.",CO170CL08
20915,36,"That very night, dona Severina watched Inácio’s gestures from beneath lowered eyelids. She didn’t catch anything, as teatime was brief, and the kid didn’t look up from his teacup. The next day she managed to get a good look, and the following days better still.",CO170CL08
20916,37,"She could tell that it was true, that she was loved and feared, with an adolescent and virgin love checked by social ties and by a feeling of inferiority that kept him from recognizing himself. Dona Severina realized she had no disrespect to fear and concluded that the best thing was not to say anything to the lawyer; she spared the lawyer one bit of trouble and the poor child another.",CO170CL08
20917,38,"She was already talking herself into believing he was a child, and she resolved to treat him as drily as she had until then, if not more so. And so she did. Inácio started feeling that she was fleeing him with her eyes or speaking roughly, almost as much so as Borges himself. At other times, it’s true that her tone of voice came out soft and even gentle, very gentle; just as her generally elusive gaze wandered so much elsewhere that to spell itself it would come to a rest on his head. But it was all limited.",CO170CL08
20918,39,"“I’m going to leave,” he would say again and again in the street, as in his first days.",CO170CL08
20919,40,"He would go back to the house and not leave. For him, dona Severina’s arms set off a parenthesis the middle of the long and tiresome sentence of the life he was living, and that parenthetical clause contained an original and profound idea invented by providence for him alone. He went along with things, taking them as they came. In the end, however, he had to leave, and never to return; here is how and why.",CO170CL08
20920,41,"For a few days, dona Severina had been treating him kindly. The harshness of her voice seemed finished, and it was more than mild, it was full of concern and fondness. One day she would tell him not to catch a draft, another not to drink cold water after hot coffee, pieces of advice, recommendations, attentions that threw his soul into even greater disquiet and confusion.",CO170CL08
20921,42,"One day Inácio dared to laugh at the table, something he had never done, and the lawyer didn’t mistreat him that time, since it was he who was telling a funny story, and no one punishes another person for the applause he gets. It was then that dona Severina saw that the boy’s mouth, graceful when it was not moving, was no less so when it was laughing.",CO170CL08
20922,43,"Inácio’s discomposure went on growing, and he was unable to calm himself down or understand himself. He wasn’t comfortable anywhere. Outside, he got streets mixed up and went to the wrong doors much more than before, and never did he see a woman, from afar or from up close, who didn’t remind him of her.",CO170CL08
20923,44,"On entering the hall in the house on his way back from work, he always experienced a flutter, sometimes a great one, when he ran into her looking through the wooden railing at the top of the stairs, as if she had run up to see who it was.",CO170CL08
20924,45,"One Sunday—he never forgot that Sunday—he was alone in his room, at the window, facing the ocean, which spoke to him in the same obscure and new language as dona Severina. He was enjoying watching the gulls, which were making great circles in the sky or hovering over the water or just flapping their wings. The day was beautiful. It wasn’t only a Christian Sunday; it was an immense universal Sunday.",CO170CL08
20925,46,"Inácio spent them all there in the room or at the window or rereading one of the three pamphlets he had brought with him, tales from the old days, bought for a cent or two under the footbridge to the Largo do Paço. It was two in the afternoon.",CO170CL08
20926,47,"He was tired. He had slept badly after having been out and about until late the evening before. He lay down in the hammock, picked up one of the pamphlets, The Princess Magalona, and started reading. He never understood why it was that all of the heroines of these old stories had the same face and figure as dona Severina, but the fact is they did.",CO170CL08
20927,48,"After half an hour, he dropped the pamphlet and started looking at the wall, from which, five minutes later, he saw the lady of his dreams emerge. The natural thing would have been for him to be astounded, but he wasn’t astounded. With his eyelids still lowered, he saw her get loose from everything, stop, smile, and come over to the hammock. There she was in person; there were her very arms.",CO170CL08
20928,49,"It is certain, all the same, that dona Severina couldn’t have emerged from the wall even if there had been a door or another opening in it since she was in the front room just then listening to the lawyer’s footsteps as he went down the stairs. She listened to him go down, went to the window, saw him go out, and withdrew only when he went out of sight in the distance, on the way to Rua das Mangueiras.",CO170CL08
20929,50,"She went back in and sat down on the couch then. She seemed out of sorts, restless, nearly crazy. She rose and picked up the pitcher that was on the sideboard and put it back down in the same spot; then she walked to the door, stopped, and turned, seemingly at a loss.",CO170CL08
20930,51,"She sat back down again for another five or ten minutes. All at once, she remembered that Inácio had not eaten much at lunch and that he had looked downcast, and she thought he could be feeling bad; he could even be very sick.",CO170CL08
20931,52,"She left the room and went unhesitatingly down the hall to the boy’s room, the door to which she found wide open. Dona Severina stopped, peered in, and caught sight of him sleeping in the hammock with his arm out and the pamphlet fallen on the floor. His head was tilted a bit to the side of the door, showing his closed eyes, his mussed hair, and a tremendous look of joy and bliss.",CO170CL08
20932,53,"Dona Severina felt her heart pounding furiously and she backed away. She had dreamed about him at night; perhaps he was dreaming about her. The figure of the boy had been flashing before her eyes, like a diabolical temptation, since dawn. She backed away even more, then returned, watched for two, three, five minutes, or more.",CO170CL08
20933,54,"Sleep seemed to give Inácio’s adolescence a more pronounced, nearly feminine, nearly childish look. “A child!” she said to herself in that wordless tongue we all know. And this thought subdued the rushing of her blood and dispelled, in part, the roiling of her senses.",CO170CL08
20934,55,“A child!”,CO170CL08
20935,56,"And she looked slowly at him, had her fill of looking at him, with his head turned and his arm dangling; but at the same time as she found him a child she found him nice looking, much nicer looking than when he was awake, and one of these thoughts corrected or subverted the other.",CO170CL08
20936,57,"All of a sudden she shuddered and recoiled in fear: she had heard a noise nearby, in the ironing room. She went to take a look; it was a cat that had knocked a bowl over on the floor. Returning unhurriedly to look at him, she saw he was sleeping soundly. What a sound sleeper that boy was! And she went on watching him sleep—sleep and perhaps dream.",CO170CL08
20937,58,"If we could but see other people’s dreams! Dona Severina would have seen herself in the young man’s imagination; she would have seen herself in front of the hammock, laughing and idle; then, leaning over, taking his hands, bringing them to her breast, enveloping them in her arms, her famous arms.",CO170CL08
20938,59,"Inácio, in love with them, still heard her words, which were beautiful, warm, and above all new—or were at least from some language that was unfamiliar to him, although he understood it.",CO170CL08
20939,60,"Two, three, and four times the figure faded away only to return from the ocean or from another direction, in the midst of seagulls, or coming down the hall with all of the sturdy grace she could muster. And on her return she leaned over, took his hands again, and clasped them to her breast with her arms, until, leaning farther over, much farther, she puckered her lips and left him a kiss on the mouth.",CO170CL08
20940,61,"At this point the dream coincided with reality, and the same mouths came together in the imagination and out of it. The difference is that the vision didn’t recoil, whereas the real person, ashamed and fearful, had run for the door no sooner than the gesture had been made.",CO170CL08
20941,62,"From there, she went to the front room, bewildered by what she had done, without focusing on anything. She pricked her ears, went to the end of the hall to see if she could catch any noise letting her know he had woken up, and only after a long time did her fear leave her. The boy was in fact a sound sleeper; nothing, neither nearby bustle nor genuine kisses, opened his eyes.",CO170CL08
20942,63,"But though she may have gradually overcome her fear, the shame remained, and it grew. Dona Severina could not believe what she had done; it was as if her desires had been wrapped up with the thought that he was a loving child who was lying there unaware and without blame; and she, half mother, half friend, had bent down and kissed him. Regardless, she was confused, irritated, angry at herself and at him. The fear that he could have been pretending to be asleep cropped up, and it caused her to shudder.",CO170CL08
20943,64,"But the fact is he went on sleeping a lot longer, and he woke up only to eat. Cheerfully, he took a seat at the table. Although he found dona Severina silent and harsh and the lawyer as surly as always, neither the man’s surliness nor the woman’s harshness could dispel the beautiful vision he was still carrying within him or deaden the feeling of the kiss.",CO170CL08
20944,65,"He didn’t notice that dona Severina was wearing a shawl that covered her arms; he noticed later, on Monday, and on Tuesday, and until Saturday, which was the day Borges had word sent to his father that he couldn’t stay with him; and he didn’t do so in anger, because Borges treated him relatively well, and on his departure he even said to him:",CO170CL08

20949,70,"He thought so long and hard that he ended up imagining he had taken an indiscreet look at her, done something absentmindedly that had offended her—it couldn’t have been anything else. And thus the expressionless face and the shawl covering those pretty arms. . . .",CO170CL08
20950,71,"No matter; he was taking the taste of the dream with him.

20963,12,"They were, it must be said, beautifully full and rounded arms in perfect harmony with their mistress—who was more plump than thin—and neither their color nor their softness suffered on being exposed to the air. However, it is only fair to explain that she did not display them out of vanity, but because all her long-sleeved dresses were too old and worn.

20966,15,"Inácio lingered over his coffee as long as he could. Between one sip and the next, he smoothed the tablecloth, picked imaginary bits of skin from his fingers, or let his eyes wander over the pictures in the dining room, of which there were two: one of Saint Peter and one of Saint John, devotional prints brought back from church festivals and framed at home.",CO170CL10
20967,16,"He might just about be able to hide his thoughts from Saint John, whose youthful head brings cheer to Catholic imaginations, but the austere Saint Peter was too much for him. In his defense, young Inácio could plead only that he saw neither one nor the other; his eyes passed over them as if there were nothing there at all. He saw only Dona Severina’s arms—either because he took the occasional stealthy sideways glance at them, or because they were emblazoned on his memory.",CO170CL10
20968,17,"“Come on, man! Are you still not done?” bellowed the attorney suddenly.",CO170CL10
20969,18,"There was nothing for it. Inácio downed the last drop of already cold coffee, and retired, as usual, to his room at the rear of the house. On entering, he made a silent gesture of anger and despair, then went over to lean at one of the two windows looking out to sea.",CO170CL10
20970,19,"After five minutes, the view of the water close by and the mountains far off brought back the confused, vague, restless feeling that both pained and comforted him, much as a plant must feel when its first flower blooms. He wanted to leave, but also to stay. He’d been there for five weeks now, and his life followed the same, unchanging routine: leaving the house every morning with Borges, hanging around the courts and notaries’ offices, running here and there getting documents stamped and delivered, chasing after clerks and bailiffs.",CO170CL10
20971,20,"In the afternoon, he would return to the house, have his dinner, and go to his room until it was time for supper; after supper, he went straight to bed. Borges did not treat him as part of the family, which consisted solely of Dona Severina, whom Inácio saw only three times a day at mealtimes. Five weeks of solitude and drudgery, far from his mother and sisters; five weeks of silence, since he only spoke now and then to someone in the street, and in the house, not a word.",CO170CL10
20972,21,"“Just you wait,” he thought to himself one day, “I’ll run away and never come back.”",CO170CL10
20973,22,"But he stayed; chained and shackled there by Dona Severina’s arms. He had never seen such fresh, pretty arms. His upbringing would not allow him to look at them directly; at first it seems he even averted his eyes in embarrassment. Little by little, though, he did begin to look, especially when he realized that those arms were always unencumbered by sleeves, and thus he gradually began to discover, contemplate, and love them.",CO170CL10
20974,23,"By the end of three weeks they had become, spiritually speaking, the tent where he laid his weary head. He put up with the hard slog of mundane work, the melancholy of his solitude and silence, his boss’s rudeness, for the reward of seeing, three times a day, that stupendous pair of arms.",CO170CL10
20975,24,"The very same evening, as night fell and Inácio was stretching out in his hammock (for there was no other bed for him), Dona Severina, in the front room, was going over the episode at dinner and, for the first time, began to suspect something. She quickly rejected the idea—he was a child, for goodness’ sake!",CO170CL10
20976,25,"But some ideas are like insistent flies: however often we brush them away, they still return to pester us. A child? He was fifteen years old; and she noted that between the lad’s nose and lip were the fuzzy beginnings of a mustache. Was it so surprising that he had begun to fall in love? Was she not, after all, pretty?",CO170CL10
20977,26,"She did not reject this second observation, but rather cherished and embraced it. She recalled his listless demeanor, his lapses of concentration, his habit of staring into the middle distance—such small things, but symptoms nonetheless. Yes, she concluded, he must be in love.",CO170CL10
20978,27,"“What’s the matter with you?” asked the attorney after several minutes’ silence, as he lay on the sofa.",CO170CL10
20979,28,"“Nothing,” she replied.",CO170CL10
20980,29,"“Nothing? Everyone in this house seems half asleep! Well, just you wait; I know a good cure for sleepyheads . . .”",CO170CL10
20981,30,"And on he went, in the same angry tone, firing off threats that he was quite incapable of carrying out, for he was more boorish than bad. Dona Severina interrupted several times to tell him he was mistaken, that she hadn’t been sleeping, but rather thinking about Fortunata, her godson’s mother. They hadn’t been to see her since Christmas; perhaps one of these evenings they should pay her a visit.",CO170CL10
20982,31,"Borges retorted that he was tired, that he’d been working like a black, that he wasn’t in the mood for social chitchat, and then launched into a tirade against the mother, the father, and the godson, who at ten years of age still wasn’t at school! By that age, he, Borges, could already read, write, and do his sums; not very well, of course, but still. Ten years old! Well, it was sure to end badly: he’d be picked up off the streets and marched off to war, that’s what would happen. A soldier’s billet would sort him out, one way or another.",CO170CL10
20983,32,"Dona Severina tried to assuage him with excuses: the mother’s poverty, the father’s string of misfortunes. She caressed her husband, tentatively, for fear of irritating him further. It was now completely dark, and she heard the tlic of the streetlamp as the gas was lit, and saw its glow reflected in the windows of the house across the street. Borges, tired after his long day (for he really was a prodigiously hard worker), let his eyes close and drifted off to sleep, leaving her alone in the room, in the dark, alone with herself and this new discovery.",CO170CL10
20984,33,"Everything seemed to tell her it was true; but this truth, once she had gotten over the initial shock, brought with it a moral dilemma she could only recognize by its effects, since she had no means of identifying exactly what it was. She could make no sense of herself, nor regain her equilibrium, and she even thought of telling the attorney everything so that he would send the young whippersnapper packing.",CO170CL10
20985,34,"But what was “everything”? Here she paused: in reality there was nothing but supposition, coincidence, and quite possibly delusion. No, not delusion. She began to piece together all the vague clues in the boy’s behavior: his awkwardness, his absentmindedness, and rejected the idea that she might be mistaken.",CO170CL10
20986,35,"But shortly afterward (ah, capricious nature!), reflecting that it would be wrong to make groundless accusations, she admitted that she was perhaps fooling herself after all. Her sole aim, of course, was to watch the young man more closely and ascertain the true state of affairs.",CO170CL10
20987,36,"That same evening, Dona Severina surreptitiously studied Inácio’s every look and gesture. She could find nothing, because teatime was very short, and the boy scarcely raised his eyes from his cup. The next day she was able to observe him more closely, and even more so in the days that followed.",CO170CL10
20988,37,"She realized that, yes, she was both loved and revered—an adolescent and virginal love constrained by social proprieties and by a feeling of inferiority that prevented the young man from even acknowledging it to himself. Dona Severina saw that she need fear no impertinence on his part, and decided it was best to say nothing to her husband; she would be sparing both him and the poor child any unpleasantness.",CO170CL10
20989,38,"By now she was persuaded that he was indeed a child, and resolved to treat him just as coolly as before, or even more so. And so she did; Inácio began to notice that she avoided his looks and spoke sharply to him, almost as sharply as Borges himself. It’s true that, on other occasions, her tone of voice was soft, even tender, very tender; in the same way, her gaze, generally so elusive, wandered so much around the room that, for a moment’s respite, it would occasionally come to rest upon his head; but such moments were only fleeting.",CO170CL10
20990,39,"“I’ve got to leave,” he would say to himself in the street, just as he had in the early days.",CO170CL10
20991,40,"He would arrive back at the house, though, and he wouldn’t leave. Dona Severina’s arms were a parenthesis in the long, tedious sentence of the life he was leading and this interpolated clause contained a profound and original idea, invented by Heaven solely for him. So he stayed and carried on as before. Finally, however, he did have to leave, never to return; here’s the how and why.",CO170CL10
20992,41,"For several days, Dona Severina had been treating him kindly. The severe tone had vanished from her voice, and now there was more than just softness, there was genuine care and affection. One day, she warned him to keep away from drafts, another day, she told him not to drink cold water after hot coffee—the advice, thoughts, and concerns of a friend and mother, all of which threw Inácio into an even greater state of confusion and consternation.",CO170CL10
20993,42,"He grew so confident, however, that he actually laughed at the table, something he had never done before. This time the attorney did not scold him, because it was the attorney himself who was telling a funny story, and no one punishes an appreciative audience. It was then that Dona Severina noticed that the young lad’s lips, attractive when he was silent, were no less so when he laughed.",CO170CL10
20994,43,"Inácio’s turmoil grew and grew, and he could neither calm himself nor understand what was going on. He felt uncomfortable wherever he was. He would wake up at night thinking about Dona Severina. When out on his errands, he became even more likely to take a wrong turn or knock on the wrong door, and every woman he saw, from near or far, reminded him of her.",CO170CL10
20995,44,"He always felt a certain, occasionally intense, excitement when he returned from work and found her standing at the top of the stairs, peering down through the wooden banisters, as if she had rushed to see who it was.",CO170CL10
20996,45,"One Sunday—a Sunday he would never forget—Inácio was alone in his room, at the window, looking out to sea, which spoke to him in the same obscure new language as Dona Severina. He was amusing himself watching the seagulls as they made wide circles in the air, or hovered above the water, or simply fluttered on the breeze. It was a magnificent day, not merely a Christian Sabbath, but an immense, universal Sabbath.",CO170CL10
20997,46,"Inácio spent all his Sundays there in his room, either at the window or rereading one of the three cheap, slender books he had brought with him from home, stories of times gone by, purchased for a penny under the arches on Largo do Paço. It was two o’clock in the afternoon.",CO170CL10
20998,47,"He was tired; he had slept badly the night before, after having walked a lot the previous day. He stretched out in the hammock, picked up one of the books—Princess Magalona—and began to read. He could never understand why all the heroines in these old stories had the same face and figure as Dona Severina, but they did.",CO170CL10
20999,48,"After half an hour, he let the book drop and rested his eyes on the wall, from where, five minutes later, he saw the lady of his dreams emerge. He should, naturally, have been astonished, but he wasn’t. Even though his eyes were shut, he watched her detach herself from the wall, pause, smile, and walk toward the hammock. It really was her; those really were her arms.",CO170CL10
21000,49,"It is certain, however, that Dona Severina could not have emerged from the wall, even had there been a door or a crack in it, for at that very moment she was in the front room listening to the attorney’s footsteps going down the stairs. When he reached the bottom, she went to the window to watch him leave the house, only withdrawing once he had disappeared into the distance, on his way to Rua das Mangueiras.",CO170CL10
21001,50,"Then she came back into the room and sat on the sofa. She seemed out of sorts, restless, almost manic; she stood up, went over to the sideboard, picked up a jug only to set it back down in the same place; then she walked to the door, paused, and turned back, for no apparent reason.",CO170CL10
21002,51,"She sat down again for five or ten minutes. Suddenly she remembered that Inácio had eaten very little at breakfast and had looked rather downcast; she wondered if he might be ill, perhaps even gravely ill.",CO170CL10
21003,52,"She left the parlor and went straight along the hallway to the young man’s bedroom. The door was wide open. Dona Severina stopped, peered in, and saw him lying in the hammock, asleep, one arm hanging loose and his book lying on the floor. His head was tilted slightly toward the door, so she could see his closed eyes, his tousled hair, and a wide, blissful grin on his face.",CO170CL10
21004,53,"Dona Severina felt her heart pounding furiously, and drew back. The previous night she had dreamt of him; perhaps now he was dreaming of her. Ever since dawn, the lad’s face had danced before her eyes like a devilish temptation. She took a further step back, then returned, and looked at him for two, three, five minutes or more.",CO170CL10
21005,54,"Sleep seemed to accentuate Inácio’s youth, giving it an almost feminine, childlike expression. “A child!” she said to herself, in that wordless language we all carry around inside us. And this idea slowed her racing blood and somewhat calmed her turbulent senses.",CO170CL10
21006,55,“A child!”,CO170CL10
21007,56,"She gazed at him unhurriedly, until she had had her fill: his head tilted to one side, one arm hanging loose; but, at the same time as she found him childlike, she also found him handsome, much more so than when he was awake; one of these notions either corrected or corrupted the other.",CO170CL10
21008,57,"Suddenly she jumped back in fear: she had heard a sound close by, in the linen closet. She went to investigate: a cat had knocked a bowl onto the floor. Creeping back to spy on Inácio, she saw that he was still sleeping soundly. He was certainly a deep sleeper! The noise that had made her jump out of her skin hadn’t even caused him to stir. She stood there and watched him sleep—to sleep, perchance to dream.",CO170CL10
21009,58,"Ah, if only we could see other people’s dreams! Dona Severina would have seen herself in the boy’s imagination; she would have seen herself standing by the hammock, smiling and quite still, then leaning toward him, taking his hands, raising them to her chest, and folding them in her arms, those stupendous arms.",CO170CL10
21010,59,"Even thus, in love with her arms, Inácio could still hear her words, which were beautiful, warm, and above all new—or, rather, they belonged to some language he did not know, although he understood it well enough.",CO170CL10
21011,60,"Two, three, and even four times, the figure faded only to return, swooping in from the sea or from up among the seagulls, or sailing down the hallway with her usual sturdy elegance. And each time she returned, she would lean toward him, take his hands once again, and fold them in her arms, until, leaning closer, much closer, she pursed her lips and kissed him gently on the mouth.",CO170CL10
21012,61,"Here the dream coincided with reality, and the same mouths united both in his imagination and outside it. The difference is that the vision did not draw back, whereas the real person had no sooner kissed him than she fled to the door, ashamed and afraid.",CO170CL10
21013,62,"She went back to the front room, shocked at what she had done and staring blankly into space. Straining her ears, retracing her steps down the hallway, she listened for any sound of him waking, and it took quite some time before her fears subsided. The child really did sleep like a log; nothing would open his eyes, neither the nearby sound of things breaking nor real-life kisses.",CO170CL10
21014,63,"But while her fears subsided, her shame lingered and grew. Dona Severina could not believe what she had done; it seems she had swathed her desires in the notion that this was an adoring child lying blameless and unconscious there before her; and, half mother, half friend, she had leaned over and kissed him. Be that as it may, she felt confused, cross, and annoyed with herself and with him. The fear that he might have been feigning sleep troubled her soul and sent shivers down her spine.",CO170CL10
21015,64,"In fact, he carried on sleeping for a long time and only awoke for dinner. He sat down gaily at the table. Although Dona Severina was as tight-lipped and stern as ever, and the attorney just as abrasive, neither the harshness of one nor the severity of the other could dispel the charming vision he still carried inside his head, or dull the sensation of that kiss.",CO170CL10
21016,65,"He didn’t notice that Dona Severina was wearing a shawl covering her arms; he noticed later, on Monday, and then again on Tuesday, and every day until Saturday, which was the day on which Borges sent to tell the boy’s father that he couldn’t keep him on any longer. He did not act in anger, though, for he treated Inácio relatively well and even said to him as he left:",CO170CL10
21017,66,"“If you ever need me for anything, you know where I am.”",CO170CL10
21018,67,"“Yes, sir. And Senhora Dona Severina . . . ?”",CO170CL10
21019,68,"“She’s up in her room, with a very bad headache. Come back tomorrow or the day after to say goodbye to her.”",CO170CL10
21020,69,"Inácio left, not understanding a thing. He didn’t understand his dismissal, or Dona Severina’s complete change of attitude, or the shawl, or any of it. She had seemed so contented! She had spoken to him so kindly! How, then, so suddenly . . . ?",CO170CL10
21021,70,"He thought and thought, and ended up imagining that some indiscreet look on his part, some thoughtless act, had offended her; yes, that must be it, and that would explain her scowling face and the shawl covering her lovely, lovely arms . . .",CO170CL10
21022,71,"Well, never mind; he still had his dream to savor. And down through the years, despite other love affairs, more real and lasting, he never felt anything that could match the sensation of that Sunday, in Rua da Lapa, when he was fifteen years old. He even sometimes exclaims, not knowing how wrong he is:",CO170CL10

21025,2,"“. . . ITEM: IT IS MY FINAL WISH that the coffin in which my body is to be buried shall be made at the workshop of Joaquim Soares, in Rua da Alfândega. I wish him to be informed of this disposition, which shall also be made public. Joaquim Soares does not know me, but he merits this distinction on account of being one of our finest craftsmen, and one of the most highly esteemed men in all of Brazil . . .”",CO114CL10
21026,3,"This testamentary disposition was carried out to the letter. Joaquim Soares made the coffin in which the body of poor Nicolau B. de C. was laid; he made it with his own hands, con amore, and, when he had finished, in a gesture of goodwill, he waived all payment. He had, he insisted, already been paid; for the mark of favor shown by the deceased man was, in itself, a worthy prize.",CO114CL10
21027,4,"He asked only one thing: to be given the original copy of the relevant clause. His wish was granted, and he had it framed and hung from a nail in his workshop. Once they had recovered from their astonishment, the other coffin-makers protested that the clause was utter nonsense. Happily—and this is one of the advantages of the modern social state—happily, everyone else considered that this hand, reaching up from the abyss to bestow its blessings on the work of a humble artisan, had performed an act of rare magnanimity.",CO114CL10
21028,5,"It was 1855 and the population was more closely knit then; people spoke of nothing else. For many days, Nicolau’s name echoed through the Rio press, from where it then passed to the provincial newspapers. But universal life is so varied, events happen with such bewildering frequency and speed, and, ultimately, man’s memory is such a fragile thing, that a day came when Nicolau’s magnanimous action sank into oblivion.",CO114CL10
21029,6,"I have not come here to restore that action. Forgetting is a necessity. Life is a slate that destiny must first wipe clean before it can write anew. It’s a simple matter of pencil and sponge. No, I am not here to restore his action. There are thousands of actions just as noble as his, or even nobler, and they are all equally forgotten. I am here to say that the clause in the will was not an effect without a cause; I am here to reveal to you one of this century’s most curious maladies.",CO114CL10
21030,7,"Yes, dear reader, we will be entering the realms of pathology. That little boy you see back there at the end of the last century (when he died in 1855, Nicolau was sixty-eight), that little boy is not a healthy vessel; he is not a perfect organism. On the contrary, from his tenderest years on, he showed through repeated actions that there was in him some inner defect, some flaw of nature.",CO114CL10
21031,8,"There is no other way to describe the persistence with which he rushed to destroy the other boys’ playthings—and I’m not talking about toys that were inferior or the same as his, but specifically those that were better or more expensive. It is even more difficult to understand why, in cases where the toy was particularly special or unusual, the young Nicolau would then console the victim with a kick, and often two or three. All this is very mysterious.",CO114CL10
21032,9,"It cannot have been his father’s fault. His father was a respected trader or dealer (as the Marquis of Lavradio used to say, most of those in this city who call themselves “merchants” are nothing more than dealers on commission), who lived in a certain splendor during the last quarter of the century; a harsh, austere man who frequently admonished and, where necessary, punished his son. But neither admonishments nor punishments did any good.",CO114CL10
21033,10,"Nicolau’s inner impulse was far stronger than all his father’s lashings, and, once or twice a week, the little boy slipped back into his errant ways. The family was appalled. One event in particular—in view of its grave consequences—deserves to be told.",CO114CL10
21034,11,"The viceroy, who, at the time, was the Count of Resende, felt a pressing need to construct a new quayside along the shore at Praia de Dom Manuel. Today, this would be a straightforward municipal matter, but at the time, given the city’s more modest proportions, it was a major undertaking. What the viceroy lacked were funds; the public coffers could barely cover normal emergencies. A true statesman, and doubtless a philosopher, he came up with an expedient that was as agreeable to all as it was profitable, namely, handing out, in exchange for pecuniary donations, the ranks of captain, lieutenant, and ensign.",CO114CL10
21035,12,"When the decision was announced, Nicolau’s father realized that this was an opportunity, without danger to life or limb, to take his place among the military luminaries of the age, while at the same time disproving one of the teachings of the Brahmins. For it is written in the Laws of Manu that from the arms of Brahma were born the warriors, while from his belly came the farmers and merchants. By acquiring his captain’s commission, Nicolau’s father was correcting this point of pagan anatomy.",CO114CL10
21036,13,"Another merchant, with whom he competed on every score, but who was also a close friend, heard about the appointment and immediately went to add his own rock to the quayside. Unfortunately, his pique at being several days late prompted him to make a request that was in poor taste and, in these particular circumstances, disastrous; he asked the viceroy for a second “quay officer’s” commission (for such was the title given to those decorated under this system) for his seven-year-old son. The viceroy hesitated, but the petitioner doubled his donation and pulled a lot of strings, and the little boy duly came away with the rank of ensign.",CO114CL10
21037,14,"All this was done in secret; Nicolau’s father only learned what had happened the following Sunday, in the Carmo Church, when he saw both father and son together, with the boy dressed up in a diminutive but rather dashing uniform. Nicolau, who was also there, turned deathly pale and, in a flash, hurled himself on the young ensign and, before his parents could intervene, had torn the boy’s uniform to shreds. You can imagine the scandal. The general hubbub, the worshippers’ pious indignation, and the victim’s squeals interrupted the ecclesiastical proceedings for several moments. The fathers exchanged some sharp words outside on the steps, and remained enemies ever after.",CO114CL10
21038,15,“That boy will bring disgrace on us all!” roared Nicolau’s father when they got home.,CO114CL10
21039,16,"Nicolau received a sound beating, endured much pain, cried and sobbed, but did not mend his ways. The toys of the other boys were no less prone to attack than before. The same began to happen with their clothes. The wealthier boys in the neighborhood would now venture out only in the humblest of homemade garments, which was the only way of escaping Nicolau’s sharp nails. With the passage of time, his aversion extended to their faces if they were handsome, or considered as such.",CO114CL10
21040,17,"In the street where he lived there were countless bruised, scratched, and muddied faces. Things reached such an extreme that his father decided to lock him up in the house for three or four months. This was a palliative and, as such, proved excellent. While his confinement lasted, Nicolau was nothing less than angelic; for, aside from that gruesome habit of his, he was gentle, docile, obedient, fond of his family and never missed prayers. After four months, his father released him; it was time to find him a tutor to teach him reading and grammar.",CO114CL10
21041,18,"“Leave him with me,” said the master. “With me and with this,” he added, picking up the strap, “it’s highly unlikely that he will entertain any further notions of harming his companions.”",CO114CL10
21042,19,"Foolish, foolish tutor! There is no doubt that he succeeded in saving the handsome boys and their fancy clothes by punishing poor Nicolau’s initial onslaughts. But how would this help cure his malady? On the contrary, by being obliged to repress and swallow his impulses, he suffered twice over, and his ever paler complexion took on a greenish tinge. Sometimes, he said, he had to look away or even close his eyes so as not to explode.",CO114CL10
21043,20,"Although he stopped tormenting the most elegant or best-dressed boys, he did not let up on the more studious ones; he would beat them and hurl their books out the window. Brawls, bloodshed, and loathing; such were the fruits of life for him, on top of the cruel beatings he himself suffered, and yet his family stubbornly refused to understand.",CO114CL10
21044,21,"If we add that he was unable to apply himself to any continuous study, or only in fits and starts and poorly—much like the haphazard and unmethodical way in which beggars eat—you will have some idea of the painful consequences of his hidden malaise. His father, who had dreamed of sending his son to university and now found even this illusion shattered, was ready to give up on him completely; it was his mother who saved him.",CO114CL10
21045,22,"One century ended and another began without Nicolau’s wound healing. His father died in 1807 and his mother in 1809; his sister married a Dutch physician just over a year later. Nicolau now lived alone. He was twenty-three, one of the city’s dandies, and a rather peculiar one at that, for he could not bear to encounter anyone who was either handsomer than he, or wearing some particularly fine item of clothing, without suffering a violent pain, so violent, in fact, that he sometimes had to bite his lip until it bled.",CO114CL10
21046,23,"There were times when he would nearly collapse, or when an almost imperceptible thread of foam would trickle from one corner of his mouth. And things went from bad to worse. He became harsh and domineering; at home, he found everything bad, troublesome, or infuriating; he smashed plates over the slaves’ heads, and tormented the dogs by kicking them; he couldn’t sit still for ten minutes at a time and he barely ate a thing.",CO114CL10
21047,24,"Finally, he would fall asleep, and it was just as well that he did. Sleep solved everything. He would wake up feeling affable and affectionate, like a true patriarch, kissing the dogs between the ears, letting them lick his face, giving them the best of everything, calling the slaves the sweetest, most endearing names. And all of them, dogs and slaves alike, forgot about the previous night’s beatings and came running obediently and adoringly when they heard his voice, as if this were their true master, and not the other one.",CO114CL10
21048,25,"One day, when he was at his sister’s house, she asked him why he had not taken up some career or other, something to occupy himself.",CO114CL10

21050,27,"His brother-in-law weighed in and suggested the diplomatic service. The brother-in-law was beginning to suspect that Nicolau did indeed suffer from some sort of malady and thought a change in climate would be just the thing to set him straight. Nicolau obtained a letter of introduction and went to see the minister of foreign affairs. He found the minister surrounded by some of his Portuguese officials, and just about to go to the palace with news of the second fall of Napoleon, news which had arrived only a few minutes earlier.",CO114CL10
21051,28,"The presence of the minister, the circumstances of the moment, the bowing and scraping of the officials, all this filled Nicolau with such alarm that he could not look the minister in the face. He made several attempts, but the one time he succeeded, his vision was so blurred that he could see nothing at all, or only a shadow, a shape, which made his eyes ache and his face turn green. Nicolau retreated, tremulously reached for the door curtain, and fled.",CO114CL10
21052,29,“I don’t want to be anything!” he said to his sister when he got home. “You and my friends are enough.”,CO114CL10
21053,30,"His friends were the most disagreeable young men in the city, vulgar and lowborn. Nicolau had chosen them on purpose. To live a life divorced from the leading citizens of his day was for him a great sacrifice, but since he would suffer much more by living with them, he put up with it. This proves that he had a certain empirical awareness of his illness and how to relieve it. The simple fact of the matter was that with his chosen companions all of Nicolau’s physiological disturbances disappeared. He could look at them without turning deathly pale, without his sight blurring or his legs giving way, or anything like that.",CO114CL10
21054,31,"What’s more, they not only saved him from his natural irritability, they endeavored to make his life, if not delightful, then at least tranquil. To do this, they would shower him with the greatest compliments in the world, delivered in a fawning manner or with a certain deferential familiarity. Nicolau loved all kinds of inferior beings, just as patients love the medicine that restores them to health; he would patronize them, heap them with affectionate praise, lend them money, give them little gifts, even bare his soul to them. Then came the Cry of Ipiranga and the Declaration of Independence; Nicolau threw himself into politics.",CO114CL10
21055,32,"In 1823 we find him in the Constituent Assembly. It goes without saying that, in fulfilling his legislative duties, he was honest, impartial, and patriotic. However, exercising these public virtues did not come without a price, but at the expense of great mental torment. Metaphorically speaking, one can say that his attendance in the chamber cost him precious blood. Not only because the debates were intolerable, but also because it was hard for him to have to look at certain men, especially on certain days.",CO114CL10
21056,33,"Montezuma, for example, struck him as utterly shallow, Vergueiro a dullard, and the Andrada brothers detestable. Every speech, not only from the leading orators, but even from the second-rate ones, was sheer torture for Nicolau. And yet he remained steadfast and punctual. He never missed a single vote; never once did his name ring out in that august chamber without him providing an answering echo. However great his desperation, he was able to contain himself and put the national interest above his own discomfort. He may even have secretly applauded the decree of dissolution.",CO114CL10
21057,34,"I can’t confirm this, but there are good reasons to believe that, despite appearances, Nicolau was happy to see the assembly dissolved. And if that conjecture is true, then this second one is no less so: that the exile of certain leading figures in the assembly, now branded public enemies, came to dilute that pleasure. For Nicolau, who had suffered from their speeches, suffered no less from their exile, since it gave them a certain prominence. If only he, too, had been exiled!",CO114CL10
21058,35,"“You could always get married, brother,” his sister said to him.",CO114CL10
21059,36,“But I don’t have a fiancée.”,CO114CL10
21060,37,"“I can get you one, if you like.”",CO114CL10
21061,38,"This was her husband’s idea. In his opinion, medical science had discovered the illness plaguing Nicolau: it was a worm in his spleen that fed on the patient’s suffering, that is, a particular secretion that was produced at the sight of certain occurrences, situations, or persons. It was simply a matter of killing the worm. But since there was no known chemical substance capable of destroying the worm, the only solution was to prevent the secretion, since that would produce the same result. It was, therefore, imperative to marry Nicolau to some pretty and talented girl, remove him from the city, and set him up on some country estate, to which he would take his best dinner service, his finest furniture, and his most disreputable friends.",CO114CL10
21062,39,"“Every morning,” the brother-in-law explained to his wife, “Nicolau will receive a newspaper that I will have specially printed with the sole aim of telling him the most agreeable things in the world, listing them one by one, recalling his modest yet useful work on the Constituent Assembly, and attributing to him many amorous adventures, along with sundry flashes of wit and courage.",CO114CL10
21063,40,"I have already spoken to my fellow Dutchman, the admiral, about getting some of our officers to go and see Nicolau from time to time and tell him how they could not possibly return to The Hague without doing themselves the honor of setting eyes on so charming and eminent a citizen, one who combines so many qualities rarely found in one individual. If you, my dear, could only persuade one of your fancy dressmakers—Gudin, for example—to name one of their hats or frilly lace capes after Nicolau, that would greatly help in your brother’s cure. Anonymous love letters, sent by the post, are another remarkably efficient remedy. But first things first; let’s get him married.”",CO114CL10
21064,41,"Never was a plan more conscientiously executed. The bride chosen was the most elegant, or one of the most elegant, in the capital. The bishop himself married them. When they duly withdrew to the country estate, only a few of Nicolau’s coarsest friends went with him. The newspaper was set up, letters were sent, and visits were paid. For three months everything went swimmingly. But nature, always ready to wrong-foot us, showed yet again that it can never be predicted. One of the methods used to please Nicolau was to praise the beauty, elegance, and virtues of his wife; but his illness had grown worse, and what had seemed like an excellent remedy now simply aggravated his condition.",CO114CL10
21065,42,"After a while, Nicolau found all these paeans to his wife pointless and excessive, and that was enough to make him irritable, and for his irritability to provoke the inevitable secretion. It seems he even reached the point of not being able to look at her for very long, and then scarcely at all; several rows ensued, which would have signaled the beginnings of a separation had she not died shortly after. Nicolau’s grief was profound and genuine, but the cure was soon interrupted because he went back to Rio de Janeiro, where we will find him some time later among the revolutionaries of 1831.",CO114CL10
21066,43,"Although it may seem rash to state the reasons that led Nicolau to join the jeering crowds at the Campo da Aclamação on the night of the sixth of April, I think it would not be far from the truth to suppose that it was the words of a famous but anonymous Athenian. Those who spoke ill of the Emperor were just as pleasing to Nicolau as those who spoke well.",CO114CL10
21067,44,"That man, who inspired such enthusiasm and hatred and whose name was endlessly repeated wherever Nicolau happened to be, whether in the street, the theater, or other people’s houses, had become a truly unhealthy obsession, from which flowed the fervor with which he involved himself in the events of 1831. The abdication came as a great relief. It is true that the ensuing Regency soon found him among its adversaries, and there are some who assert that he joined the Caramuru, or “Restoration” Party, although there is no proof of this. What is certain is that Nicolau’s public life ended with the events surrounding the new Emperor’s coming of age.",CO114CL10
21068,45,"The disease had now taken definitive hold over his whole organism. Little by little, Nicolau retreated into seclusion. He could no longer visit certain people or frequent certain houses. Even the theater was no longer a distraction. The state of his auditory organs was so delicate that the sound of applause caused him excruciating pain.",CO114CL10
21069,46,"The enthusiasm of the city’s inhabitants for the famous sopranos Candiani and Meréa, but principally for Candiani, whose carriage was drawn by willing fans—a distinction even more remarkable in that they wouldn’t have done it for Plato himself—such enthusiasm was one of Nicolau’s greatest torments. He reached the point where he stopped going to the opera altogether, finding Candiani utterly unbearable, and finding the organ grinders’ version of Norma preferable to that of the prima donna. It was not out of a sense of exaggerated patriotism that he enjoyed listening to João Caetano in the early days, but eventually Nicolau gave him up, too, and the theaters almost entirely.",CO114CL10
21070,47,"“It’s hopeless,” thought the brother-in-law. “If we could only give him a new spleen . . .”",CO114CL10
21071,48,"How could he think something so ridiculous? Nicolau was, indeed, a hopeless case. Domestic pleasures no longer sufficed. His literary endeavors—family verses, prized ditties, and political odes—were short-lived, and may even have made him worse. In any case, it struck him one day that this occupation was the most ridiculous thing in the world, and the endless praise heaped on the works of Gonçalves Dias, for example, suggested to him a nation slipping into banal bad taste. This literary sentiment, the fruit of his wounded self, acted further upon the same wound to the point of producing a string of serious crises that confined him to bed for some time. His brother-in-law took the opportunity to clear the house of all books of a certain tenor.",CO114CL10
21072,49,"Less explicable is why, in a matter of months, he began to take so little care over his appearance. Brought up to be always elegantly dressed, he had been a long-standing customer of one of the leading tailors in Rio, a man called Plum, and not a single day would go by without him having his hair tended to by Messrs. Desmarais & Gérard, coiffeurs de la cour, on Rua do Ouvidor. It seems, however, that he found this “hairdressers to the court” designation excessively conceited, and punished them by taking his business to a backstreet barber. As to why he changed his attire, I can only say that it remains a mystery and, unless attributable to age, utterly inexplicable.",CO114CL10
21073,50,"His dismissal of his cook is another enigma. At the instigation of his brother-in-law, who was doing his best to keep him entertained, Nicolau gave two dinners a week, and his guests were, of course, unanimous in their opinion that Nicolau’s cook surpassed all others in the city. The dishes really were rather good, some of them excellent, but the praise was a little too emphatic, a little too excessive, for it to be entirely agreeable to Nicolau, and this went on for some time. How to explain, then, that one Sunday, just after a magnificent dinner, he dismissed the remarkable man who had been the indirect cause of some of his most delightful moments on Earth? Another impenetrable mystery.",CO114CL10
21074,51,“He was a thief!” was the answer he gave his brother-in-law.,CO114CL10
21075,52,"Neither the efforts of his brother-in-law, sister, and friends, nor his wealth, improved the lot of our poor, sad Nicolau. The secretion in his spleen became continual and the worms multiplied by the millions—I have no idea whether this theory is true, by the way, but it was, after all, his brother-in-law’s. Nicolau’s final years were extremely cruel. He lived in a state of almost continual debilitation, irritable and almost blind, suffering far more acutely than those around him. The slightest thing would set his nerves on edge: a good speech, a clever artist, a carriage, a cravat, a sonnet, a witty remark, an interesting dream—everything brought on an attack.",CO114CL10
21076,53,"Did he want to die? One might suppose so, seeing the indifference with which he rejected all the remedies of the city’s leading physicians. Eventually it was necessary to resort to deception and tell him they had been prescribed by some ignorant quack. But it was too late. Death carried him off a couple of weeks later.",CO114CL10
21077,54,"“Joaquim Soares?” cried the brother-in-law in astonishment, when he learned of the clause in the dead man’s will specifying who should make his coffin. “That oaf’s coffins are no good at all, and—”",CO114CL10

Then he went to the window and stood there for ten or twelve minutes, tapping his foot on the floor and looking out at the street, a backstreet in the Lapa district.",CO161CL06
21081,3,"Surely, there isn’t a man reading this, and much less, a woman, who won’t assume immediately that the paper that young Gonçalves has crumbled into a ball is a letter, a love letter, expressing a girl’s ill temper, for example, or informing him that her father opposes their relationship, that the father is packing her out of Rio that very day for some weeks in the country. Erroneous guesses! It isn’t a love letter, not a letter at all, really, even though it is addressed to him and signed and dated at the bottom.",CO161CL06
21082,4,"Here is what this is about: Gonçalves is a student whose family lives in the provinces. His father has an agent in Rio who doles out the young man’s monthly living allowance. Gonçalves gets his allowance punctually every month, he spends it immediately, and most of the time he has no money. He gets along fine, though, because to be twenty years old itself constitutes great wealth. On the other hand, to be twenty also means to be inexperienced and headstrong, so Gonçalves slips here and there and occasionally commits major blunders.",CO161CL06
21083,5,"Not long ago he saw a coat, a fur coat of the sort that stylish students wear, unbelievably nice, and a walking cane to go with it, nothing fancy, but in excellent taste. He had no money, so he bought them on credit. It wasn’t his idea, mind you; a friend encouraged him. That was four months ago, and the store owner won’t leave him in peace. Gonçalves decided to send the bill to his father’s agent describing the situation in terms that would melt the hardest heart on earth.",CO161CL06
21084,6,"The agent did not have a hard heart; being an agent, he had none at all. He went rigidly by the book, or rather, according to the letters of instruction sent to him by the father, who said that his son was a spendthrift and required discipline. When Gonçalves sent him the bill, though, the agent saw that it needed to be paid.",CO161CL06
21085,7,"How to do so without encouraging the young man to keep buying things on credit? The agent sent word that he would pay the bill, but not without first writing to the father, asking for instructions, and informing him of other, less consequential bills that he had already paid. All this was written in two or three lines at the bottom of the bill itself, which he had returned to Gonçalves.",CO161CL06
21086,8,"One understands the young man’s unhappiness. The bill had not been paid, and worse, now his father was going to hear about it. If it were for something different, it wouldn’t be so bad. But the bill was for an unnecessary luxury, a fur coat, an enormous encumbrance really, heavy and hot … Gonçalves swore at the shop owner and even more at his father’s agent. Why had the man gone and told his father? What a letter his father was going to write now! What a letter! Gonçalves could just imagine what it would say, because it wouldn’t be the first. Last time his father had threatened to cut off his money completely.",CO161CL06
21087,9,"After swearing at the agent and changing his mind several times about what to do next, Gonçalves decided that the best plan was to go straight to the fellow’s house armed with his walking cane, tell him a thing or two, and give him a thrashing if he answered back.

Finally, he left, his twenty fervent years boiling in his veins, incapable of swallowing the insult and disguising his annoyance. Once outside, Gonçalves passed the Ocean Walk, Our Lady of Perpetual Help Street, and Goldsmith Street. He went all the way to Ouvidor Street, and it occurred to him he could go that way to the agent’s house. So he took Ouvidor, but he didn’t turn to look at fellows who waved at him there, or even at the pretty girls who were out for a walk. Like a charging bull, he looked neither left nor right.

They asked where he was going. “To punish an uppity scoundrel,” replied Gonçalves, by which his four friends knew that his target was neither church nor state, but, rather, someone to whom he owed money or, very probably, a rival.

He smoked his cigarette, drank his coffee in small, slow sips, and gazed into the street. Then he interrupted his friends to declare that Chiquinha was pretty, but not the prettiest, and he cited five or six others. Some of his friends agreed entirely, some partly, and some not at all.

Even men who lived for only a few decades invented a term for that sense of weariness, tedium vitae, which they could never truly have known, not at least in all its vast and unyielding reality, because to acquire such a profound aversion to existence it is necessary to have walked, as I have, through every generation and through every ruin.",CO179CL10

I traveled everywhere, encountered all races, beliefs, and tongues; I traveled in sunshine and in snow, among civilized peoples and barbarians, to islands and to continents; wherever mankind breathed, there breathed I.

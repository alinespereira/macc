2,2,THE POSTHUMOUS MEMOIRS OF BRÁS CUBAS,17,RO005TR03
3,3,To the Worm Who Gnawed the Cold Flesh of My Corpse I Dedicate These Posthumous Memoirs As a Nostalgic Remembrance,17,RO005TR03
4,4,"Prologue to the Third Edition
 <DIFFERENT SOURCE VERSION>",17,RO005TR03
5,5,"The first edition of these Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas came in sections in the Revista Brásileira during the 1880s. When they were put into book form later on I corrected the text in several places. Now that I have had to review it for the third edition, I have emended yet a few more things and eliminated two or three dozen lines. Revised in this way, this work which seems to have garnered some acceptance on the part of the public, is published once again.",17,RO005TR03
6,6,"Capistrano de Abreu, taking note of the publication of the book, asked “Is The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas a novel?” Macedo Soares in a letter that he wrote me around that time recalled fondly the Travels in My Land [of Almeida Garrett]. To the first the late Brás Cubas has already replied (as the reader has seen and will see in the prologue by him that opens the book) yes and no, that it was a novel for some and wasn’t for others. As for the second, this is how the decedent has explained it: “It’s a question of a scattered work where I, Brás Cubas, have adopted the free form of a Sterne or a Xavier de Maistre. I’m not sure, but I may have put a few fretful touches of pessimism into it.” All those people traveled: Xavier de Maistre around his room, Garrett in his land, Sterne in other people’s lands. It might be said of Brás Cubas that he traveled around life.",17,RO005TR03
7,7,"What makes my Brás Cubas a singular author is what he calls “a few fretful touches of pessimism.” There is in the soul of this book, for all of its merry appearance, a harsh and bitter feeling that is a far piece from its models. It’s a goblet that may carry a similar design but contains a different wine. I shall say no more so as not to get into any criticism of a dead man who painted himself and others according to what seemed best and most authentic to him.",17,RO005TR03

9,9,To the Reader,17,RO005TR03
10,10,"That Stendhal should have confessed to have written one of his books for a hundred readers is something that brings on wonder and concern. Something that will not cause wonder and probably no concern is whether this other book will have Stendhal’s hundred readers, or fifty, or twenty, or even ten. Ten? Five, perhaps. The truth is that it’s a question of a scattered work where I, Brás Cubas, have adopted the free-form of a Sterne or a Xavier de Maistre. I’m not sure, but I may have put a few fretful touches of pessimism into it. It’s possible. The work of a dead man. I wrote it with a playful pen and melancholy ink and it isn’t hard to foresee what can come out of that marriage. I might add that serious people will find some semblance of a normal novel, while frivolous people won’t find their usual one here. There it stands, deprived of the esteem of the serious and the love of the frivolous, the two main pillars of opinion.",17,RO005TR03
11,11,"Nonetheless, I hope to entice sympathetic opinion and the first trick is to avoid any explicit and long prologue. The best prologue is the one that says the fewest things or which tells them in an obscure and truncated way. Consequently, I shall not recount the extraordinary process through which I undertook the composition of these Memoirs, put together here in the other world. It would have been interesting but excessively long and also unnecessary for an understanding of the work. The work itself is everything: if it pleases you, dear reader, I shall be well paid for the task; if it doesn’t please you, I’ll pay you with a snap of the finger and goodbye.",17,RO005TR03

14,14,The Author’s Demise,17,RO005TR03
15,15,"For some time I debated over whether I should start these memoirs at the beginning or at the end, that is, whether I should put my birth or my death in first place. Since common usage would call for beginning with birth, two considerations led me to adopt a different method: the first is that I am not exactly a writer who is dead but a dead man who is a writer, for whom the grave was a second cradle; the second is that the writing would be more distinctive and novel in that way. Moses, who also wrote about his death, didn’t place it at the opening but at the close: a radical difference between this book and the Pentateuch.",17,RO005TR03
16,16,"With that said, I expired at two o’clock on a Friday afternoon in the month of August, 1869, at my beautiful suburban place in Catumbi. I was sixty-four intense and prosperous years old, I was a bachelor, I had wealth of around three hundred cantos, and I was accompanied to the cemetery by eleven friends. Eleven friends! The fact is, there hadn’t been any cards or announcements. On top of that it was raining—drizzling—a thin, sad, constant rain, so constant and so sad that it led one of those last-minute faithful friends to insert this ingenious idea into the speech he was making at the edge of my grave:",17,RO005TR03
17,17,"“You who knew him, gentlemen, can say with me that nature appears to be weeping over the irreparable loss of one of the finest characters humanity has been honored with. This somber air, these drops from heaven, those dark clouds that cover the blue like funeral crepe, all of it is the cruel and terrible grief that gnaws at nature and at my deepest insides; all that is sublime praise for our illustrious deceased.”",17,RO005TR03
18,18,"Good and faithful friend! No, I don’t regret the twenty bonds I left you. And that was how I reached the closure of my days. That was how I set out for Hamlet’s undiscovered country without the anxieties or doubts of the young prince, but, rather, slow and lumbering, like someone leaving the spectacle late. Late and bored. Some nine or ten people had seen me leave, among them three ladies: my sister Sabina, married to Cotrim—their daughter, a lily of the valley,—and … Be patient! In just a little while I’ll tell you who the third lady was.",17,RO005TR03
19,19,"Be content with knowing that the unnamed one, even though not a relative, suffered more than the relatives did. It’s true. She suffered more. I’m not saying that she wailed, I’m not saying that she rolled on the ground in convulsions, or that my passing was a highly dramatic thing … An old bachelor who expires at the age of sixty-four doesn’t seem to gather up all the elements of a tragedy in himself. And even if that were the case, what least suited that unnamed lady was to show such feelings. Standing by the head of the bed, her eyes cloudy, her mouth half open, the sad lady had a hard time believing my extinction.",17,RO005TR03
20,20,“Dead! Dead!” she kept saying to herself.,17,RO005TR03
21,21,"And her imagination, like the storks that an illustrious traveler watched taking flight from the Ilissus on their way to African shores without the hindrance of ruins and times—that lady’s imagination also flew over the present rubble to the shores of a youthful Africa … Let it go. We’ll get there later on. We’ll go there when I get my early years back.",17,RO005TR03
22,22,"Now I want to die peacefully, methodically, listening to the ladies sobbing, the men talking softly, the rain drumming on the caladium leaves of my suburban home, and the strident sound of a knife a grinder is sharpening outside by a harness-maker’s door. I swear to you that the orchestra of death was not at all as sad as it might have seemed. From a certain point on it even got to be delightful. Life was thrashing about in my chest with the surging of an ocean wave. My consciousness was evaporating. I was descending into physical and moral immobility and my body was turning into a plant, a stone, mud, nothing at all.",17,RO005TR03
23,23,"I died of pneumonia, yet if I tell my reader that it wasn’t so much the pneumonia that caused my death but a magnificent and useful idea he might not believe me and, nevertheless, it’s the truth. Let me explain briefly. You can judge for yourself.",17,RO005TR03
24,24,II,17,RO005TR03
25,25,The Poultice,17,RO005TR03
26,26,"As it so happened, one day in the morning while I was strolling about my place an idea started to hang from the trapeze I have in my brain. Once hanging there it began to wave its arms and legs and execute the most daring antics of a tightrope-walker that anyone could imagine. I let myself stand there contemplating it. Suddenly it took a great leap, extended its arms and legs until it took on the shape of an X: decipher me or I’ll devour you.",17,RO005TR03
27,27,"That idea was nothing less than the invention of a sublime remedy, an antihypochondriacal poultice, destined to alleviate our melancholy humanity. In the patent application that I drew up afterward I brought that truly Christian product to the government’s attention. I didn’t hide from friends, however, the pecuniary rewards that would of needs result from the distribution of a product with such far-reaching and profound effects.",17,RO005TR03
28,28,"But now that I’m on the other side of life I can confess everything: what mainly influenced me was the pleasure I would have seeing in print in newspapers, on store counters, in pamphlets, on street corners, and, finally, on boxes of the medicine these three words: Brás Cubas Poultice. Why deny it?",17,RO005TR03
29,29,"I had a passion for ballyhoo, the limelight, fireworks. More modest people will censure me perhaps for this defect. I’m confident, however, that clever people will recognize this talent of mine. So my idea had two faces, like a medal, one turned toward the public and the other toward me. On one side philanthropy and profit, on the other a thirst for fame. Let us say:—love of glory.",17,RO005TR03
30,30,"An uncle of mine, a canon with full prebend, liked to say that love of temporal glory was the perdition of souls, who should covet only eternal glory. To which another uncle, an officer in one of those old infantry regiments called terços, would retort that love of glory was the most truly human thing there was in a man and, consequently, his most genuine attribute.",17,RO005TR03
31,31,Let the reader decide between the military man and the canon. I’m going back to the poultice.,17,RO005TR03
32,32,III,17,RO005TR03
33,33,Genealogy,17,RO005TR03
34,34,"Now that I’ve mentioned my two uncles, let me make a short genealogical outline here.",17,RO005TR03
35,35,"The founder of my family was a certain Damião Cubas, who flourished in the first half of the eighteenth century. He was a cooper by trade, a native of Rio de Janeiro, where he would have died in penury and obscurity had he limited himself to the work of barrel making. But he didn’t. He became a farmer. He planted, harvested, and exchanged his produce for good, honest silver patacas until he died, leaving a nice fat inheritance to a son, the licentiate Luís Cubas.",17,RO005TR03
36,36,"It was with this young man that my series of grandfathers really begins—the grandfathers my family always admitted to—because Damião Cubas was, after all, a cooper, and perhaps even a bad cooper, while Luís Cubas studied at Coimbra, was conspicuous in affairs of state, and was a personal friend of the viceroy, Count da Cunha.",17,RO005TR03
37,37,"Since the surname Cubas, meaning kegs, smelled too much of cooperage, my father, Damião’s great–grandson, alleged that the aforesaid surname had been given to a knight, a hero of the African campaigns, as a reward for a deed he brought off: the capture of three hundred barrels from the Moors. My father was a man of imagination; he flew out of the cooperage on the wings of a pun. He was a good character, my father, a worthy and loyal man like few others. He had a touch of the fibber about him, it’s true, but who in this world doesn’t have a bit of that?",17,RO005TR03
38,38,"It should be noted that he never had recourse to invention except after an attempt at falsification. At first he had the family branch off from that famous namesake of mine, Captain-Major Brás Cubas, who founded the town, of São Vicente, where he died in 1592, and that’s why he named me Brás. The captain-major’s family refuted him, however, and that was when he imagined the three hundred Moorish kegs.",17,RO005TR03
39,39,"A few members of my family are still alive, my niece Venância, for example, the lily of the valley, which is the flower for ladies of her time. Her father, Cotrim, is still alive, a fellow who … But let’s not get ahead of events. Let’s finish with our poultice once and for all.",17,RO005TR03
40,40,IV,17,RO005TR03
41,41,The Idée Fixe,17,RO005TR03
42,42,"My idea, after so many leaps and bounds, had become an idée fixe. God save you, dear reader, from an idée fixe, better a speck, a mote in the eye. Look at Cavour: It was the idée fixe of Italian unity that killed him. It’s true that Bismarck didn’t die, but we should be warned that nature is terribly fickle and history eternally meretricious. For example, Suetonius gave us a Claudius who was a simpleton—or “a pumpkinhead” as Seneca called him—and a Titus who deserved being the delight of all Rome.",17,RO005TR03
43,43,"In modern times a professor came along and found a way of demonstrating that of the two Caesars the delight, the real delight, was Seneca’s “pumpkinhead.” And you Madame Lucrezia, flower of the Borgias, if a poet painted you as the Catholic Messalina, along came an incredulous Gregorovius who did a great deal to quench that quality and even if you didn’t come out a lily, you weren’t a smelly fen either. I’ll take my position between the poet and the savant.",17,RO005TR03
44,44,"So, long live history, voluble history, which is good at anything, and, getting back to the idée fixe, let me say that it’s what produces strong men and madmen. A mobile idea, vague or changeable, is what produces a Claudius—according to the formula of Suetonius.",17,RO005TR03
45,45,"My idea was fixed, fixed like … I can’t think of anything fixed enough in this world: maybe the moon, maybe the pyramids of Egypt, maybe the dead German Diet. Let the reader find the comparison that fits best, let him find it and not stand there with his nose out of joint just because we haven’t got to the narrative part of these memoirs. We’ll get there. I think he prefers anecdotes to reflections, like other readers, his confreres, and I think he’s right.",17,RO005TR03
46,46,"So let’s get on with it. It must be said, however, that this book is written with apathy, with the apathy of a man now freed of the brevity of the century, a supinely philosophical work, of an unequal philosophy, now austere, now playful, something that neither builds nor destroys, neither inflames nor cools, and, yet, it is more than a pastime and less than an apostolate.",17,RO005TR03
47,47,"Let’s go. Straighten out your nose and let’s get back to the poultice. Let’s leave history with its whims of an elegant lady. Neither of us fought the battle of Salamina or wrote the Augsburg Confession. For my part, if I can ever remember Cromwell it’s only because of the idea that His Highness, with the same hand that locked up Parliament might have imposed the Brás Cubas poultice on the English. Don’t laugh at that joint victory of pharmaceutics and puritanism.",17,RO005TR03
48,48,"Who isn’t aware that beneath every great, public, showy flag quite often there are several other modestly private banners that are unfurled and waving in the shadow of the first, and ever so many times outlive it? To make a poor comparison, it’s like the rabble huddled in the shadow of a feudal castle, and when the latter fell, the riffraff remained. The fact is they became big shots and castellans… No, that’s not a good comparison.",17,RO005TR03
49,49,V,17,RO005TR03
50,50,In Which a Lady’s Ear Appears,17,RO005TR03
51,51,"When I was busy preparing and refining my invention, however, I was caught in a strong draft. I fell ill right after and I didn’t take care of myself. I had the poultice on my brain. I was carrying with me the idée fixe of the mad and the strong. I could see myself from a distance rising up from the mob-ridden earth and ascending to heaven like an immortal eagle, and before such a grand spectacle no man can feel the pain that’s jabbing at him.",17,RO005TR03
52,52,"The next day I was worse. I finally did something about it, but in an incomplete way, with no method or attention or follow-through. Such was the origin of the illness that brought me to eternity. You already know that I died on a Friday, an unlucky day, and I think I’ve shown that it was my invention that killed me. There are less lucid and no less winning demonstrations.",17,RO005TR03
53,53,"It might not have been impossible, however, for me to have climbed to the heights of a century and figure in the pages of newspapers among the great. I was healthy and robust. Let it be imagined that, instead of laying down the bases for a pharmaceutical invention, I was trying to bring together the elements of a political institution or a religious reformation. The current of air came and efficiently conquered human calculations and there went everything. That’s the way man’s fate goes.",17,RO005TR03
54,54,"With that reflection I took leave of the woman, I won’t say the most discreet, but certainly the most beautiful among her contemporaries, the one whose imagination, like the storks on the Ilissus … She was fifty-four then, she was a ruin, a splendid ruin. Let the reader imagine that we had been in love, she and I, many years before and that, one day, when I was already ill, I see her appear in the door of my bedroom.",17,RO005TR03
55,55,VI,17,RO005TR03
56,56,"Chiméne, Qui L’eût Dit? Rodrigue, Qui L’eût Cru?",17,RO005TR03
57,57,"I see her appear in the door of my bedroom—pale, upset, dressed in black—and remain there for a minute without the courage to come in, or held back by the presence of the man who was with me. From the bed where I was lying I contemplated her all that time, neglecting to say anything to her or make any gesture. We hadn’t seen each other for two years and I saw her now not as she was but as she had been, as we both had been, because some mysterious Hezekiah had made the sun turn back to the days of our youth. The sun turned back, I shook off all my miseries, and this handful of dust that death was about to scatter into the eternity of nothingness was stronger than time, who is the minister of death. No water from Iuventus could match simple nostalgia in that.",17,RO005TR03
58,58,"Believe me, remembering is the least evil. No one should trust present happiness, there’s a drop of Cain’s drivel in it. With the passing of time and the end of rapture, then, yes, then perhaps it’s possible really to enjoy, because between these two illusions the better one is the one that’s enjoyed without pain.",17,RO005TR03
59,59,"The evocation didn’t last long. Reality took over immediately. The present expelled the past. Perhaps I’ll explain to the reader in some corner of this book my theory of human editions. What matters now is that Virgília—her name was Virgília—entered the room with a firm step, with the gravity that her clothes and the years gave her, and came over to my bed. The outsider got up and left. He was a fellow who would visit me every day and talk about exchange rates, colonization, and the need for developing railroads, nothing of greater interest to a dying man.",17,RO005TR03
60,60,"He left. Virgília stood there. For some time we remained looking at each other without uttering a word. What was there to say? Of two great lovers, two great passions, there was nothing left twenty years later. There were only two withered hearts devastated by life and glutted with it; I don’t know whether in equal doses, but glutted nonetheless. Virgília now had the beauty of age, an austere, maternal look. She was less thin than when I saw here the last time at a Saint John’s festival in Tijuca and, as she was someone who had a great deal of resistance, only now were a few silver threads beginning to mingle with her dark hair.",17,RO005TR03
61,61,“Are you making the rounds visiting dying men?” I asked her.,17,RO005TR03
62,62,"“Come now, dying men!” Virgília answered with a pout. And then, after squeezing my hands, “I’m making the rounds to see if I can get lazy loafers back out onto the street.”",17,RO005TR03
63,63,"It didn’t have the teary caress of other times, but her voice was friendly and sweet. She sat down. I was alone in the house except for a male nurse. We could talk to each other without any danger. Virgília gave me lots of news from the world outside, narrating it with humor, with a certain touch of a wicked tongue, which was the salt of her talk. I, ready to leave the world, felt a satanic pleasure in making fun of it all, in persuading myself that I wasn’t leaving anything worthwhile.",17,RO005TR03
64,64,"“What kind of ideas are those?” Virgília interrupted me, a little annoyed. “Look, I’m not going to come back. Dying! We all have to die. It’s enough just being alive.”",17,RO005TR03
65,65,And looking at the clock:,17,RO005TR03
66,66,“Good heavens! It’s three o’clock. I’ve got to go.”,17,RO005TR03
67,67,“So soon?”,17,RO005TR03
68,68,“Yes. I’ll come back tomorrow or sometime later.”,17,RO005TR03
69,69,"“I don’t know if you’re doing the proper thing,” I replied. “The patient is an old bachelor and the house has no women in it…”",17,RO005TR03
70,70,“What about your sister?”,17,RO005TR03
71,71,"“She’s going to come and spend a few days here, but she can’t get here until Saturday.”",17,RO005TR03
72,72,"Virgília thought for a moment, straightened up, and said gravely:",17,RO005TR03
73,73,“I’m an old woman! Nobody pays any attention to me anymore. But just to put an end to any doubts I’ll come with Nhonhô.”,17,RO005TR03
74,74,"Nhonhô was a lawyer, the only child from her marriage, who at the age of five had been the unwitting accomplice in our love affair. They came together two days later and I must confess that when I saw them there in my bedroom I was taken by a reticence that prevented me from replying immediately to the lad’s affable words, Virgília sensed this and told her son:",17,RO005TR03
75,75,"“Nhonhô, don’t pay any attention to that big trickster there. He doesn’t want to talk so he can make you think that he’s at death’s door.’",17,RO005TR03
76,76,"Her son smiled. I think I smiled, too, and everything ended up as a big joke. Virgília was serene and smiling. She had the look of immaculate life. No suspect look, no gesture that might have given anything away, a balance in word and spirit, control over herself, all of which seemed—and perhaps was—strange. As by chance we touched upon an illicit love affair, half-secret, half-known, I saw her speak a disdainful word and a bit indignantly about the woman involved, a friend of hers besides. Her son felt satisfied when he heard that strong and fitting word and I asked myself what the hawks might have said about us humans if Buffon had been born a hawk …",17,RO005TR03
77,77,It was the start of my delirium.,17,RO005TR03
78,78,VII,17,RO005TR03
79,79,Delirium,17,RO005TR03
80,80,"As far as I know, no one has ever spoken about his own delirium. I’m doing just that and science will thank me for it. If the reader isn’t given to the contemplation of these mental phenomena, he may skip this chapter and go straight to the narrative. But if he has the slightest bit of curiosity, I can tell him now that it’s interesting to know what went on in ray head for some twenty or thirty minutes.",17,RO005TR03
81,81,"At the very first I took on the figure of a Chinese barber, potbellied, dexterous, who was giving a close shave to a mandarin, who paid me for my work with pinches and sweets: the whims of a mandarin.",17,RO005TR03
82,82,"Right after that I felt myself transformed into Aquinas’ Summa Theologca, printed in one volume and morocco-bound, with silver clasps and illustrations. This was an idea that gave my body a most complete immobility and even now I can remember that with my hands as the book’s clasps crossed over my stomach, someone was uncrossing them (Virgília most certainly) because that position gave her the image of a dead person.",17,RO005TR03
83,83,"Finally, restored to human form, I saw a hippopotamus come and carry me off. I let myself go, silent, I don’t know whether out of fear or trust, but after a short while the running became so dizzying that I dared question him and in some way told him that the trip didn’t seem to be going anywhere.",17,RO005TR03
84,84,"“You’re wrong,” the animal replied, “we’re going to the origin of the centuries.”",17,RO005TR03
85,85,"I suggested that it must be very far away, but the hippopotamus either didn’t understand me or didn’t hear me, unless he was pretending one of those things, and when I asked him, since he could talk, if he were a descendant of Achilles’ horse or Balaam’s ass, he answered me with a gesture peculiar to those two quadrupeds, he flapped his ears. For my part, I closed my eyes and let myself go where chance would take me.",17,RO005TR03
86,86,"I must confess now, however, that I felt some sort of prick of curiosity to find out where the origin of the centuries was, if it was as mysterious as the origin of the Nile, and, most of all, whether the consummation of those same centuries was really worth anything: the reflections of a sick mind. Since I was going along with my eyes closed I couldn’t see the road. I can only remember that a feeling of cold grew stronger as the journey went on and that a time came when it seemed to me that we were entering the region of perpetual ice.",17,RO005TR03
87,87,"In fact, I opened my eyes and saw that my animal was galloping across a white plain of snow, here and there a mountain of snow, vegetation of snow, and several large animals of snow. Everything’ snow. A sun of snow was coming out to freeze us. I tried to speak but all I could manage was to grunt this anxious question:",17,RO005TR03
88,88,“Where are we?”,17,RO005TR03
89,89,“We just passed Eden.”,17,RO005TR03
90,90,“Fine. Let’s stop at Abraham’s tent.”,17,RO005TR03
91,91,“But we’re traveling backward!” my mount retorted mockingly.,17,RO005TR03
92,92,"I was vexed and confused. The trip was beginning to seem tiresome and reckless, the cold was uncomfortable, the ride furious, and the result impalpable. And afterward—the cogitations of a sick man—if we did reach the indicated goal, it wasn’t impossible that the centuries, annoyed at having their origin infringed upon, would squash me between their fingers, which must have been as age-old as they.",17,RO005TR03
93,93,"While I was thinking along those lines we were gobbling up the road and the plain flew under our feet until the animal became fatigued and I was able to look more calmly at my surroundings. Only look: I saw nothing except the vast whiteness of the snow, which by now had invaded the sky itself, blue up till then. Here and there a plant or two might appear, huge and brutish, the broad leaves waving in the wind. The silence of that region was like a tomb. It could be said that the life of things had become stupidity for man.",17,RO005TR03
94,94,"Had it fallen out of the air? Detached itself from the earth? I don’t know. I do know that a huge shape, the figure of a woman, appeared to me then, staring at me with eyes that blazed like the sun. Everything about that figure had the vastness of wild forms and everything was beyond the comprehension of human gaze because the outlines were lost in the surroundings and what looked thick was often diaphanous. Stupefied, I didn’t say a word, I couldn’t even let out a cry, but after a time, which was brief, I asked who she was and what her name was: the curiosity of delirium.",17,RO005TR03

100,100,"Saying that, the vision reached out her arm, grabbed me by the hair, and lifted me up as if I were a feather. Only then did I manage to get a close look at her face, which was enormous. Nothing more serene; no violent contortion, no expression of hatred or ferocity. The only expression, general, complete, was that of selfish impassivity, that of eternal deafness, that of an immovable will. Wrath, if she had any, was buried in her heart. At the same time, in that face of glacial expression there was a look of youth and a blend of strength and vitality before which I felt the weakest and most decrepit of creatures.",17,RO005TR03

I’m dreaming most certainly or if it’s true that I went mad, you’re nothing but the conception of a lunatic. I mean a hollow thing that absent reason can’t control or touch. You Nature?

You’ve had more than enough of what I presented you with that’s the least base or the least painful: the dawn of day, the melancholy of afternoon, the stillness of night, the aspects of the land, sleep, which when all’s said and done is the greatest benefit my hands can give.

I cast my eyes down one of the slopes and for a long time, in the distance, through the mist I contemplated a strange and singular thing.

In order to describe it one would have to make a lightning bolt stand still. The centuries were filing by in a maelstrom and yet, because the eyes of delirium are different, I saw everything that was passing before me—torments and delights—from that thing called glory to the other one called misery, and I saw love multiplying misery and I saw misery intensifying weakness.",17,RO005TR03

They were different forms of an illness that sometimes gnaws at the entrails, sometimes at thoughts, and in its Harlequin costume eternally stalks the human species. Pain relents sometimes, but it gives way to indifference, which is a dreamless sleep, or to pleasure, which is a bastard pain.",17,RO005TR03

It’s amusing, but digest me.”",17,RO005TR03

It came along agile, dexterous, vibrant, self-confident, a little diffuse, bold, knowledgeable, but in the end as miserable as the ones before, and so it passed, and that was how the others passed, with the same rapidity and the same monotony. I redoubled my attention, sharpened my sight. I was finally going to see the last—the last! But by then the speed of the march was such that it went beyond all comprehension.

There’s no getting rid of her. She was hardened to shame a long time ago. Now, if we take note of the huge number of houses she occupies—some permanently, others during their periods of calm—we will conclude that this affable wanderer is the terror of householders. In our case there was almost a commotion at the door to my brain because the intruder didn’t want to relinquish the house and the owner wouldn’t give up her intention of taking what was hers. In the end Folly contented herself with a small corner of the attic.",17,RO005TR03

I was received in the arms of Pascoela, the celebrated midwife from Minho, who boasted of having opened the door to the world for a whole generation of aristocrats. It’s possible that my father had heard that declaration, but I think that paternal feeling was what induced him to show her his gratification with two half-doubloons. Washed and swathed, I immediately became the hero of our house. Everybody predicted for me what best fitted his taste. My Uncle Joßo, the former infantry officer, saw a certain Bonapartean look in me, which made my father nauseous when he heard it. My Uncle Ildefonso, a simple priest at the time, sensed a canon in me.",17,RO005TR03

There were a lot of frock coats and breeches in circulation.

I was baptized in São Domingos church one Tuesday in March, a clear day, bright and pure, with Colonel Rodrigues de Matos and his wife as godparents. They were both descendants of old northern families and truly an honor to the blood that flowed in their veins, which in times past had been shed in the war against Holland. I think the names of both were the first things I learned and I must have repeated them quite graciously or revealed some precocious talent because there was no stranger before whom I wasn’t obliged to recite them.",17,RO005TR03

154,154,"From the age of five I’d earned the nickname of “Devil Child,” and I really was just that. I was one of the most malevolent children of my time, evasive, nosey, mischievous, and willful. For example, one day I split open the head of a slave because she’d refused to give me a spoonful of the cocoanut confection she was making and, not content with that evil deed, I threw a handful of ashes into the bowl and, not satisfied with that mischief, I ran to tell my mother that the slave was the one who’d ruined the dish out of spite. And I was only six years old.",17,RO005TR03

I tended to mitigate it, explain it, classify it into sections, understand it not according to a rigid pattern but in light of circumstance and place. My mother indoctrinated me in her own way, made me learn certain precepts and prayers by heart. But I felt that, more than by the prayers, I was governed by nerves and blood, and the Golden Rule lost its living spirit and became a hollow formula. In the morning before porridge and at night before bed, I would beg God’s forgiveness the same as I forgave my debtors. But between morning and night I would be involved in some terrible bit of mischief and my father, after the uproar had passed, would pat me on the cheek and exclaim, laughing: “Oh, you little devil! You little devil!”",17,RO005TR03

My mother was a weak woman with not much brain and lots of heart, quite credulous, sincerely pious—homespun in spite of being pretty and modest in spite of being well-off, afraid of thunder and of her husband. Her husband was her god on Earth. My upbringing was born of the collaboration of those two people and although there was some good about it, in general it was corrupt, incomplete, and in some ways negative. My uncle the canon would sometime? remark to his brother about it, telling him that he was giving me more freedom than education and more affection than correction, but my father would answer that he was applying a system to my education that was completely superior to the usual system, and in that way, while not confusing his brother, he was duping himself.",17,RO005TR03

One of them, João, was a man with a loose tongue, a dashing life, and picaresque conversation. From the age of eleven on I was admitted to his anecdotes, true or otherwise, all contaminated with obscenity or filth. He didn’t respect my adolescence any more than he respected his brother’s cassock, with the difference that the latter would flee as soon as some scabrous subject was touched upon. Not 1.1 allowed myself to stay without understanding anything at first, later understanding, and finally finding him amusing.

He was not a man who saw the substantive side of the church. He saw the superficial side; hierarchy, pre-eminences, vestments, genuflections. He was closer to sacristy than to altar. A slip in ritual would arouse him more than an infraction of the commandments.",17,RO005TR03

And he said with all his heart that it ‘was the only honor to which he could aspire.

That was the motive for some angry disputes in our house because my Uncle João—I don’t know whether out of a spirit of class or sympathy for his profession—pardoned in the despot what he admired in the general. My priest uncle was inflexible in his opposition to the Corsican and my other relatives were divided. That was the basis of the controversy and the rows.",17,RO005TR03

No sooner said than done. All the old silver inherited from my grandfather Luís Cubas was taken down. The tablecloths from Flanders were unpacked, the large pitchers from India. A barrow was slaughtered. Compotes and quince marmalades were ordered from the nuns of Ajuda.

Not just one gloss, but three. Then he swore to his gods that it would never end. He would ask for a maxim, would be given one, would quickly gloss it, and then ask for another, and another, to the point that one of the ladies present couldn’t keep her admiration silent.",17,RO005TR03

I was as patient as I could be, but I couldn’t be for long. I asked for some dessert in a low voice. Finally I roared, bellowed, stamped my feet. My father, who would have given me the sun if I’d asked for it, called to a slave to serve me the sweet, but it was too late.

Since I showed a certain haughtiness it was hard to tell whether I was a child with the arrogance of a man or a man with the look of a boy. In short, I was a handsome young fellow, handsome and bold, who was entering life in boots and spurs, a whip in his hand and blood in his veins, mounted on a nervous, robust, swift steed, like the steeds in ancient ballads, for whom romanticism went looking in medieval castles, only to run into him on the streets of our century.

She was a good girl, cheerful, without scruples, a little hampered by the austerity of the times, which wouldn’t allow her to haul her flightiness and her gossip games through the streets, fond of luxury, impatient, a friend of money and young men.

We were a couple of youths, the people and I, We were coming out of childhood with all the ecstasy of youth. I saw her get out of a sedan chair, graceful and eye-catching, a slim, swaying body, elegant—something I’d never found in chaste women, “Follow me,” she said to her page. And I followed her, as much a page as the other, as if the order had been given to me. I let myself go, in love, vibrant, full of the first inklings of a dawn.

I won’t mention the plots I wove or the bribes or the alternation of confidence and fear or the wasted waiting or any other of those preliminary things.

I thrust my hands into her hair, drew it together, quickly wove into braids, improvised a hairdo that wasn’t very neat, and topped it off with the comb and the diamonds. I drew back, went closer again, adjusted the braids, lowered the comb on one side, tried to find some kind of symmetry in that disorder, all with the careful touch and care of a mother.",17,RO005TR03

274,274,“Lunatic!” was her first response.,17,RO005TR03
275,275,"The second was to pull me to her and reward my sacrifice with a kiss, the most ardent ever. Then she took off the comb, admired the material and the craftsmanship for a long time, looking at me every so often and nodding her head with a scolding look.",17,RO005TR03
276,276,“What am I going to do with you!” she said.,17,RO005TR03
277,277,“Are you coming with me?”,17,RO005TR03
278,278,Marcela thought for a moment. I didn’t like the expression with which her eyes passed from me to the wall and from the wall to the jewel. But that bad impression vanished completely when she answered resolutely:,17,RO005TR03
279,279,“I’ll go. When do you sail?”,17,RO005TR03
280,280,“Two or three days from now.”,17,RO005TR03
281,281,“I’ll go.”,17,RO005TR03

285,285,"At the bottom of the stairs, at the rear of the dark hall, I stopped for a few seconds to catch my breath, to touch myself, to call forth scattered ideas, to see myself in the midst of ever so many deep and contrary feelings once more. I thought I was happy. The diamonds, true, were corrupting my happiness a bit, but no less true was the fact that a pretty lady was quite capable of loving the Greeks and their gifts. And, after all, I trusted my good Marcela. She may have had defects, but she loved me …",17,RO005TR03
286,286,"“An angel!” I murmured, looking at the hall ceiling.",17,RO005TR03
287,287,"And there, like mockery, I saw Marcela’s gaze, the gaze that a short time before had given me a shade of mistrust, gleaming over a nose that was Bakbarah’s nose and mine at the same time. Poor lover from The Arabian Nights! I could see you right there, running along the gallery after the vizier’s wife, she beckoning to you with possession and you running, running, up to the long tree-lined drive from where you came out onto the street where all the harness-makers jeered at you and thrashed you.",17,RO005TR03
288,288,"Then it seemed to me that Marcela’s hallway was the drive and the street was in Baghdad. As a matter of fact, looking toward the door I saw three harness-makers on the sidewalk, one in a cassock, another in livery, another in civilian clothes, as all three entered the hallway, took me by the arms, put me into a carriage, my father on the right, my canon uncle on the left, the one in livery on the driver’s seat, and from there they took me to the house of a police official, from where I was transported to a ship that was to leave for Lisbon. You can imagine my resistance, but all resistance was useless.",17,RO005TR03
289,289,"Three days later I left the harbor behind, downcast and silent. I wasn’t even weeping. I had an idée fixe … Damned idées fixes! The one on that occasion was to dive into the ocean repeating Marcela’s name.",17,RO005TR03

292,292,"We were eleven passengers: a crazy man accompanied by his wife, two youths going on an excursion, four businessmen, and two servants. My father entrusted me to all of them, starting with the ship’s captain, who had much of his own to look after as well because, on top of everything else, he was carrying his wife, who was in the last stages of tuberculosis.",17,RO005TR03
293,293,"I don’t know whether the captain suspected anything of my lugubrious project or whether my father had put him on the alert, but I do know that he never took his eyes off me, called to me everywhere. When he couldn’t be with me he brought me to his wife. The woman was almost always on a low couch, coughing a lot, and promising to show me the sights in Lisbon. She wasn’t thin, she was transparent. It was impossible to know why she didn’t die from one moment to the next. The captain pretended not to believe in her approaching death, perhaps to deceive himself. I didn’t know or think anything. What did the fate of a tubercular woman in the middle of the ocean matter to me? The world for me was Marcela.",17,RO005TR03
294,294,"Once, after a week had passed, I thought it a propitious time to die. I went cautiously up on deck, but I found the captain standing beside the rail with his eyes fixed on the horizon.",17,RO005TR03
295,295,“Expecting a storm?” I asked.,17,RO005TR03
296,296,"“No,” he replied, shivering. “No, I was only admiring the splendor of the night. Take a look. It’s celestial!”",17,RO005TR03
297,297,"The style didn’t fit the person, rather crude and a stranger to recherché expressions. I stared at him. He seemed to be savoring my surprise. After a few seconds he took my hand and pointed to the moon, asking me why I wasn’t writing an ode to the night. I replied that I wasn’t a poet. The captain snorted something, took two steps, put his hand in his pocket, took out a piece of crumpled paper, and then, by the light of a lantern, he read a Horacian ode on the freedom of maritime life. It was his poetry.",17,RO005TR03
298,298,“What do you think?”,17,RO005TR03
299,299,"I can’t remember what I told him, but I do remember that he took my hand with a great deal of strength and a great amount of thanks. Right after that he recited two sonnets for me. He was going to recite another when they came to get him for his wife.",17,RO005TR03
300,300,"“I’ll be right there,” he said and he recited the third sonnet for me, slowly, with love.",17,RO005TR03
301,301,"I was left alone, but the captain’s muse had swept away all evil thoughts from my spirit. I preferred going to sleep, which is an interim way of dying. The following day we awakened in the midst of a storm that put fear into everyone except the madman. He started leaping about saying that his daughter was sending for him in a brougham. The death of a daughter had been the cause of his madness. No, I’ll never forget the hideous figure of the poor man in the midst of the tumult of the people and the howls of the hurricane, humming and dancing, his eyes bulging from his pale face, his hair bristly and long.",17,RO005TR03
302,302,"Sometimes he would stop, lift up his bony hands, make crosses with his fingers, then a checkerboard, then some rings, and he laughed a lot, desperately. His wife could no longer take care of him; given over to the terror of death, she was praying to all the saints in heaven for herself. Finally the storm abated. I must confess that it was an excellent diversion from the tempest in my heart. I, who’d thought about going to meet death, didn’t dare look it in the eye when it came to meet me.",17,RO005TR03
303,303,"The captain asked me if I’d been afraid, if I’d felt threatened, if I hadn’t found the spectacle sublime. Ail of that with the interest of a friend. Naturally, the conversation turned to life at sea. The captain asked me if I liked piscatorial idylls. I answered ingenuously that I didn’t know what they were.",17,RO005TR03
304,304,"“You’ll see,” he replied.",17,RO005TR03
305,305,"And he recited a little poem for me, then, another—an eclogue—and finally five sonnets, with which he capped literary confidence for that day. The following day, before reciting anything, the captain explained to me that only because of the gravest reasons had he embraced the maritime profession, because his grandmother had wanted him to be a priest and, indeed, he’d had some schooling in Latin. He didn’t get to be a priest but he never stopped being a poet, which was his natural vocation.",17,RO005TR03
306,306,"In order to prove it he immediately recited for me, in person, a hundred lines. I noticed one phenomenon: the gestures he used were such that they made me laugh once. But the captain, as he recited, looked so deep inside himself that he didn’t see or hear anything.",17,RO005TR03
307,307,"The days passed, and the waves, and the poetry, and with them the life of his wife was also passing. She wasn’t for long. One day, right after lunch, the captain told me that the sick woman might not last the week.",17,RO005TR03
308,308,“So soon!” I exclaimed.,17,RO005TR03
309,309,“She had a very bad night.”,17,RO005TR03
310,310,"I went to see her. She was almost moribund, really, but she still talked about resting in Lisbon a few days before going to Coimbra with me, because it was her proposal to take, me to the university, I left her, disconsolate, and went to find her husband, who was looking at the waves as they came to die against the hull of the ship, and I tried to console him. He thanked me, told me the tale of their love, praised his wife’s fidelity and dedication, remembered the verses he’d written for her, recited them to me. At that point they came from her to get him. We both ran. It was a crisis. That day and the following one were cruel. The third was the day of her death. I fled from the sight, it was repugnant to me. A half hour later I found the captain sitting on a pile of hawsers, his head in his hands. I said some things to comfort him.",17,RO005TR03
311,311,"“She died like a saint,” he answered. And so those words wouldn’t be taken as a sign of weakness, he immediately stood up, shook his head, and peered at the horizon with a long, profound expression. “Let’s go,” he continued, “let’s consign her to the grave that’s never opened again.”",17,RO005TR03
312,312,"Indeed, a few hours later her corpse was cast into the sea with the customary ceremony. Sadness had shriveled all the faces. That of the widower had the look of a hillock struck by a great bolt of lightning. Deep silence. The wave opened its womb, received the remains, closed—a slight ripple—and the ship went on. I let myself linger at the stern for a few minutes with my eyes on that uncertain spot in the sea where one of us had been left behind … I went off to find the captain, to distract him.",17,RO005TR03
313,313,"“Thank you,” he told me, understanding my intent. “You must believe that I’ll never forget her good care. God is the one who’ll pay her for it. Poor Leocádia! Think of us in heaven.”",17,RO005TR03
314,314,"He wiped an inconvenient tear with his sleeve. I tried to find a way out in poetry, which was his passion. I spoke to him about the verses he’d read to me and offered to get them published. The captain’s eyes lighted up a little.",17,RO005TR03
315,315,"“They might take them,” he said. “But, I don’t know, they’re rather weak verses.” I swore to him that they were not.",17,RO005TR03
316,316,I asked him to put them together and give them to me before we landed.,17,RO005TR03
317,317,“Poor Leocádia!” he murmured without answering my request. “A corpse … the sea … the sky … the ship …”,17,RO005TR03
318,318,The next day he came to read me a newly composed elegy in which the circumstances of the death and burial of his wife were memorialized. He read it to me with a truly emotional voice and his hand trembled. At the end he asked if the poem was worthy of the treasure he’d lost.,17,RO005TR03
319,319,"“Yes,” I answered.",17,RO005TR03
320,320,"“It may not have style,” he pondered after an instant, “but no one can deny me feeling, unless that very feeling is harmful to the perfection …”",17,RO005TR03

324,324,"He shrugged his shoulders, looked at the piece of paper, and recited the composition again, but this time without trembling, stressing the literary intent, giving emphasis to the imagery and melody to the lines. At the end he confessed to me that it was his most accomplished piece of work. I said that it was. He shook my hand and predicted a great future for me.",17,RO005TR03

327,327,"A great future! With that word pounding in my ears I turned my eyes back to the distance, to the mysterious and uncertain horizon. One idea drove out another, ambition was displacing Marcela. Great future? Maybe a naturalist, a literary man, an archeologist, a banker, a politician, or even a bishop—let it be a bishop—as long as it meant responsibility, preeminence, a fine reputation, a superior position. Ambition, since it was an eagle, had broken the shell of its egg on that occasion and removed the cover from that tawny, penetrating eye. Farewell, love! Farewell, Marcela! Days of delirium, priceless jewels, ungoverned life, farewell! Here I come for toil and glory. I leave you with the short pants of childhood.",17,RO005TR03
328,328,"And that was how I disembarked in Lisbon and continued on to Coimbra. The university was waiting for me with its difficult subjects. I studied them in a very mediocre way, but even so I didn’t lose my law degree. They gave it to me with all the solemnity of the occasion, following years of custom, a beautiful ceremony that filled me with pride and nostalgia—mostly nostalgia. In Coimbra I’d earned a great reputation as a carouser. I was a profligate, superficial, riotous, and petulant student, given to larks, following romanticism in practice and liberalism in theory, living with a pure faith in dark eyes and written constitutions.",17,RO005TR03
329,329,"On the day that the university certified me, on parchment, a knowledge that was far from rooted in my brain, I must confess I thought myself hoodwinked in some way, even though I was proud. Let me explain: the diploma was a certificate of emancipation. It gave me freedom, but it also gave me responsibility. I put it away, I left the banks of the Mondego and came away rather disconsolate but already feeling a drive, a curiosity, a desire to elbow others aside, to influence, to enjoy, to live—to prolong the university for my whole life forward …",17,RO005TR03

I whipped him and he gave two bucks, then three more, and finally another one that shook me out of the saddle so disastrously that my left foot got stuck in the stirrup. I tried to hold on to the beast’s belly, but by then, spooked, he took off down the road. I’m not telling it right: he tried to take off and did take a couple of bounds, but a muleteer who happened to be there ran up in time to grab the reins and hold him, not without some effort and danger. With the animal under control, he untangled me from the stirrup and stood me on my feet.",17,RO005TR03
333,333,"“Lucky you were to escape, sir,” the muleteer said.",17,RO005TR03
334,334,"And he was right. If the donkey had run away I really would have got bruised and I’m not sure but that death might have been the outcome of the disaster. Head split open, a congestion, some kind of internal injury, all my budding knowledge leaving me. The muleteer may have saved my life. I was sure of it. I felt it in the blood that was pounding through my heart, Good muleteer! While I was taking account of myself, he was carefully adjusting the donkey’s harness with great skill and zeal. I decided to give ‘him three gold coins from the five I was carrying with me. Not because it was the price of my life—that was inestimable—but because it was just recompense for the dedication with which he’d saved me. All settled, I’d give him the three coins.",17,RO005TR03

340,340,"I went to the saddlebags, took out an old waistcoat in the pocket of which I was carrying the five gold coins, but during that interval I’d got to thinking that maybe the gratuity was excessive, that two coins might be sufficient. Maybe one. As a matter of fact, one coin was enough to make him quiver with joy. I examined his clothing. He was a poor devil who’d never seen a gold coin, One coin, therefore. I took it out, saw it glitter in the sunlight. The muleteer didn’t see it because I had my back turned, but he may have suspected something. He began talking to the donkey in a meaningful way. He was giving it advice, telling it to watch out, that the “good doctor” might punish it. A paternal monologue. Good Lord! I even heard the smack of a kiss. It was the muleteer kissing it on the head.",17,RO005TR03

But a few yards away I looked back and the muleteer was bowing deeply to me as an obvious sign of contentment. I noted that it must have been just that. I’d paid him well; maybe I’d paid him too much. I put my fingers into the pocket of the waistcoat I was wearing and I felt some copper coins. They were the vinténs I should have given the muleteer instead of the silver cruzado.",17,RO005TR03
344,344,"Because, after all, he didn’t have any recompense or reward in mind. He’d followed a natural impulse, his temperament, the habits of his trade. Furthermore, the circumstance of his being right there, not ahead and not behind, but precisely at the point of the disaster, seemed to be the simple instrument of Providence. And, in one way or another, the merit of the act was positively nonexistent. I became disconsolate with that reflection. I called myself prodigal. I added the cruzado to my past dissipations.

No, I’m not going to say that I was present at the dawn of Romanticism, that I, too, went off to write poetry to that effect in the bosom of Italy. I’m not going to say a thing.

I loved my mother very much. I still had the last blessing she’d given me on board the ship before my eyes. “My poor child, I’ll never see you again!” the unfortunate lady had sobbed, clutching me to her breast. And those words echoed in my ears now like a prophecy fulfilled.",17,RO005TR03

I told him that my question was a kind of South American charade. He acted as if he understood and added that he liked South American charades a lot. He was an innkeeper. Well, I left all that, innkeeper, doge, Bridge of Sighs, gondolas, poetry of the lord, ladies of the Rialto, I left it all and took off like a shot in the direction of Rio de Janeiro.",17,RO005TR03

Kneeling by the foot of the bed with her hands in mine, I remained mute and still, not daring to speak because every word would have been a sob and we were afraid to tell her of the end. Vain fear!

370,370,"Drat! My pen got away from me there and slipped into the emphatic. Let’s be simple, as simple as the life I led in Tijuca during the first weeks after my mother’s death.",17,RO005TR03
371,371,"On the seventh day, when the funeral mass was over, I gathered together a shotgun, some books, clothing, cigars, a houseboy—the Prudêncio of Chapter XI—and went off to establish myself in an old house we owned. My father made an effort to make me change my mind, but I couldn’t and didn’t want to obey him. Sabina wanted me to go live with her for a while—two weeks at least. My brother-in-law was on the point of carrying me off forcibly. He was a good lad, that Cotrim. He’d gone from profligacy to circumspection. Now he was a food merchant, toiling from morning till night with perseverance. In the evening, sitting by the window and twirling his sideburns, that was all he had on his mind. He loved his wife and the son they had at that time who died a few years later. People said he was tightfisted.",17,RO005TR03
372,372,"I had given up everything. I was in a state of shock. I think it was around that time that hypochondria began to bloom in me, that yellow, solitary, morbid flower with an intoxicating and subtle odor. “’Tis good to be sad and say nothing!” When those words of Shakespeare’s caught my attention I must confess that I felt an echo in myself, a delightful echo.",17,RO005TR03
373,373,"I remember that I felt an echo in myself, a delightful echo. I remember that I was sitting under a tamarind tree with the poet’s book in my hands and my spirit was even more downcast than the character’s,—or crestfallen, as we say of sad hens. I clutched my taciturn grief to my breast with a singular sensation, something that could be called the sensuality of boredom. The sensuality of boredom: memorize that expression, reader, keep it, examine it, and if you can’t get to understand it you may conclude that you’re ignorant of one of the most subtle sensations of this world and that time.",17,RO005TR03
374,374,"Sometimes I would go hunting, at other times sleep, and at others read—I read a lot—other times, well, I did nothing. I let myself ramble from idea to idea, from imagination to imagination, like a vagrant or hungry butterfly. The hours dripped away, one by one, the sun set, the shadows of night veiled the mountain and the city. No one came to visit me. I had expressly asked to be left alone. One day, two days, three days, a whole week spent like that without saying a word was enough for me to shake off Tijuca and rejoin the bustle.",17,RO005TR03
375,375,"Indeed, at the end of a week I’d had more than enough of solitude. My grief had abated. My spirits were no longer satisfied with only shotgun and books or with the view of the woods and the sky. Youth was reacting, it was necessary to live. I packed away the problem of life and death, the poet’s hypochondriacs, the shirts, the meditations, the neckties in a trunk and I was about to close it when the black boy Prudêncio told me that the day before a person of my acquaintance had moved into a purple house a couple of hundred steps away from ours.",17,RO005TR03

380,380,"The episode from 1814 came to me immediately and I felt annoyed. But I called my attention to the fact that: events proved me right. Actually, it had been impossible to prevent the intimate relations between Vilaça and the sergeant-major’s sister. Even before I sailed there was already a mysterious wagging of tongues about the birth of a girl. My Uncle João wrote me later that Vilaça, when he died, had left a good legacy to Dona Eusébia, something that caused a lot of talk in the neighborhood.",17,RO005TR03
381,381,"Uncle João himself, greedy when it came to scandal, didn’t talk about anything else in the letter—several pages long, by the by. Events had proved me right. Even though they had, however, 1814 was a long way back and with it Vilaça’s mischief and the kiss in the shrubbery. Finally, no close relations existed between her and me. I made that reflection to myself and finished closing the trunk.",17,RO005TR03

391,391,"He hadn’t had lunch. We lunched together. Neither of us mentioned the sad reason for my withdrawal. Only once did we talk about it, in passing, when my father brought the conversation around to the Regency, It was then that he mentioned the letter of condolence that one of the Regents had sent him. He had the letter with him, already rather wrinkled, perhaps from having been read to so many other people. I think he said it was one of the Regents. He read it to me twice.",17,RO005TR03

395,395,"My father said that slowly, pausing, and not in the same tone of voice but giving the words a form and placement with an end to digging them deeper into my spirit. The proposals, however, went so much against my latest feelings that I really didn’t get to understand them, My father didn’t flag and he repeated them, stressing the position and the bride.",17,RO005TR03
396,396,“Do you accept?”,17,RO005TR03

400,400,"My father laughed and after laughing went back to speaking seriously. A political career was essential for me, he said, for twenty or more reasons, which he put forth with singular volubility, illustrating them with examples of people we knew. As for the bride, all I had to do was see her. If I saw her, I would immediately go ask her father for her hand, immediately, without waiting a single day.",17,RO005TR03
401,401,"In that way first he tried fascination, then persuasion, then intimation. I gave no answer, sharpening the tip of a toothpick or making little balls of bread crumbs, smiling or reflecting. And, to say it outright, neither docile nor rebellious concerning the proposals. I felt confused. One part of me said yes, that a beautiful wife and a political position were possessions worthy of appreciation. Another said no, and my mother’s death appeared to me as an example of the fragility of things, of affections, of family …",17,RO005TR03

It was precisely the lady who was to be present during my last days in 1869 and who before, long before, had played an ample part in my most intimate sensations. At that time she was only fifteen or sixteen years old. She was possibly the most daring creature of our race and, certainly, the most willful.",17,RO005TR03
421,421,"I shan’t say that she was already first in beauty, ahead of the other girls of the time, because this isn’t a novel, where the author gilds reality and closes his eyes to freckles and pimples. But I won’t say either that any freckle or pimple blemished her face, no. She was pretty, fresh, she came from the hands of nature full of that sorcery, uncertain and eternal, that an individual passes to another individual for the secret ends of creation. That was Virgília, and she was fair, very fair, ostentatious, ignorant, childish, full of mysterious drives, a lot of indolence, and some devoutness—devoutness or maybe fear. I think fear.",17,RO005TR03

The butterfly, after fluttering all about me, alighted on my head. I shook it off. It went on to land on the counterpane and because I chased it off again, it left there and settled on an old portrait of my father.",17,RO005TR03

I let myself contemplate the corpse with a certain sympathy, I must confess. I imagined that it had come out of the woods, having had breakfast, and that it was happy. The morning was beautiful. It came out of there, modest and black, having fun butterflying under the broad cupola of a blue sky, which is always blue for all wings.",17,RO005TR03
475,475,"It came through my window and found me. I suppose it had never seen a man before. It didn’t know, therefore, what a man was. It executed infinite turns around my body and saw that I moved, that I had eyes, arms, legs, a divine look, colossal stature. Then it said to itself: “This is probably the inventor of butterflies.”",17,RO005TR03
476,476,"The idea subjugated it, terrified it, but fear, which is also suggestive, hinted to it that the best way to please its creator was to kiss him on the forehead, and it kissed me on the forehead. When I drove it away, it went to land on the counterpane. There it saw my father’s picture and it’s quite possible that it discovered a half-truth there, to wit, that this was the father of the inventor of butterflies, and it flew over to beg his mercy.",17,RO005TR03
477,477,"Then the blow of a towel put an end to the adventure. The blue immensity was of no use to it, nor the joy of the flowers, nor the splendor of the green leaves against a face towel, a foot of raw linen. See how fine it is to be superior to butterflies! Because, it’s proper to say so, had it been blue, or orange, its life wouldn’t have been any more secure. It was quite possible that I would have run it through with a pin for the pleasure of my eyes. It wasn’t. That last idea gave me back my consolation. I put my middle finger against my thumb, gave a flick, and the corpse fell into the garden. It was time.

Why pretty if lame? Why lame if pretty? That was the question I kept asking myself on my way back home at night without hitting upon the solution to the enigma. The best thing to do when an enigma is unresolved is to toss it out the window. That was what I did. I laid hand onto another towel and drove off that other black butterfly fluttering in my bran. I felt relieved and went to bed. But dreams, which are a loophole in the spirit, let the bug back in and I spent the whole night delving into the mystery without explaining it.",17,RO005TR03

But the next day the morning was clear and blue and in spite of that I let myself stay, the same on the third day, the fourth, right to the end of the week. Beautiful, cool, inviting mornings. Down below, the family, the bride, parliament were calling me and I was unable to attend to anything, bewitched at the feet of my Crippled Venus. Bewitched is just a way of enhancing style. There was no bewitchment but, rather, pleasure, a certain physical and moral satisfaction. I loved her, true. At the feet of that so artless creature, a spurious, lame daughter, the product of love and disdain, at her feet I felt good, and she, I think, felt even better at my feet. And all that in Tijuca. A simple eclogue. Dona Eusébia kept watch over us, but not so very much. She tempered necessity with expedience.

Poor Eugênia! If you only knew what ideas were drifting out of my mind on that occasion! You, quivering with excitement, your arms on my shoulders, contemplating your welcome spouse in me, and I, my eyes on 1814, on the shrubbery, on Vilaça, and suspecting that you couldn’t lie to your blood, to your origins…",17,RO005TR03

Well, know, then, that at that time I was in my fourth edition, revised and corrected, but still contaminated with careless errors and incorrect usage. A defect that, on the other hand, was compensated for by the type, which was elegant, and the binding, which was deluxe. After my stroll, as I went along the Rua dos Ouvires I looked at my watch and the crystal fell to the sidewalk. I went into the first shop at hand. It was a cubicle, little more—dusty and dark.",17,RO005TR03

A man who’d loved her in times past and died in her arms had left her that jewelry store but, to make misfortune complete, there weren’t many customers coming to the shop now—maybe because of the odd situation that it was run by a woman.

The smallpox had eaten at her face. Her skin, so delicate and pink and pure before, just a day ago, looked yellow to me now, stigmatized by the same lash that had devastated the Spanish woman’s face. Her eyes, which used to be lively, were dull, her lips were sad and she had a weary air about her. I took a good look, took her hand and softly drew her toward me.

In the meantime Sabina had gone to the window that looked out onto the grounds—and after a moment she turned and proposed giving up Paulo and the other black on the condition that she get the silver.

I was writing politics and making literature. I sent articles and poems to newspapers and I managed to attain a certain reputation as a polemicist and poet. When I thought of Lobo Neves, who was already a deputy, and Virgília, a future marchioness, I asked myself whether I wouldn’t have been a better deputy and a better marquis than Lobo Neves—I, who was worth more, much more, than he—and I said that looking at the tip of my nose …",17,RO005TR03

Dr. Pangloss’ explanation is that the nose was created for the use of eyeglasses—and I must confess that such an explanation, up till a certain time, seemed to be the definitive one for me. But it happened one day while ruminating on those and other obscure philosophical points that I hit upon the only true and definitive explanation.",17,RO005TR03

When he fixes his eyes on the tip of his nose he loses his sense of outside things, becomes enraptured with the invisible, learns the intangible, becomes detached from the world, dissolves, is aetherialized. That sublimation of the being by the tip of the nose is the most lofty phenomenon of the spirit, and the faculty for obtaining it doesn’t belong to the fakir alone. It’s universal.",17,RO005TR03

It had two doors then, now it has four. It promises to have six or eight. The rival’s customers are going in through the doors.

Obviously it wasn’t mine, it belonged to somebody else, the one who’d lost it, rich or poor, and he might have been poor. Some worker who didn’t have anything to feed his wife and children with. But even if he was rich my duty remained the same.",17,RO005TR03

682,682,"I sent the letter off and ate a peaceful breakfast, I might even say a jubilant one. My conscience had waltzed so much the night before that it had lost its breath, but giving back the half doubloon was a window that opened onto the other side of morality. A wave of pure air came in and the lady breathed deeply. Ventilate your conscience! That’s all I can tell you. Nevertheless, if for no other reason, my act was a nice one because it expressed the proper scruples, the feelings of a delicate soul. That was what my inner lady was telling me, in a way that was austere and tender at the same time. That was what she was telling me as I leaned on the sill of the open window.",17,RO005TR03
683,683,"“You did well, Cubas. You behaved perfectly. This air isn’t only pure, it’s balmy, it’s the breath of the eternal gardens. Do you want to see what you did, Cubas?”",17,RO005TR03

I saw, I clearly saw the half doubloon of the night before, round, shiny, multiplying all by itself—becoming ten-—then thirty—then five hundred—expressing in that way the benefits I would be given in life and in death by the simple act of restitution. And I was pouring out my whole being into the contemplation of that act, I was seeing myself in it again, I found myself good—great perhaps. A simple coin, eh? See what it means to have waltzed just a wee bit more.",17,RO005TR03
685,685,"So I, Brás Cubas, discovered a sublime law, the law of the equivalencies of windows, and I established the fact that the method of compensating for a closed window is to open another, so that morality can continuously aerate one’s conscience.

Seeing a bundle, not large but clean and neatly tied together with strong twine, something that looked like something, I thought about giving it a kick, just for the fun of it, and I kicked it, and the package resisted. I cast my eyes about. The beach was deserted. Some children were playing far off—beyond them a fisherman was drying his nets—no one could have seen my act. I bent over, picked up the package, and went on my way.",17,RO005TR03
689,689,"I went on my way but not without some hesitation. It might have been a trick being played by some boys, I got the idea of taking what I’d found back to the beach, but I felt it and rejected the idea. A little farther on I changed course and headed home.",17,RO005TR03

691,691,"And I hesitated for a moment, because of shame, I think. The suspicion of a trick struck me again. It was certain that there’d been no outside witness there. But I had an urchin inside myself who would whisper, wink, grunt, kick, jeer, cackle, do devilish things if he saw me open the package and find a dozen old handkerchiefs or two dozen rotting guavas inside. It was too late. My curiosity was sharpened, as the reader’s must be. I unwrapped the bundle and I saw … found … counted … recounted nothing less than five cantos. Nothing less.",17,RO005TR03
692,692,"Maybe ten mil-réis more. Five cantos in good banknotes and coins, all clean and in neat order, a rare find. I wrapped them up again. At dinner it seemed to me that one of the black boys was speaking to the other with his eyes. Had they spied on me? I asked them discreetly and concluded that they hadn’t. After dinner I went back to my study, examined the money, and laughed at my maternal worries regarding the five contos—I, who was well-off.",17,RO005TR03
693,693,In order not to think about it any more I went to Lobo Neves’ that night. He’d insisted that I not miss his wife’s receptions. There I ran into the chief of police. I was introduced to him. He immediately remembered the letter and the half doubloon I’d sent him a few days before. He revealed the matter. Virgília seemed to be savoring my act and everyone of those present came up with some analogous anecdote to which I listened with the impatience of a hysterical woman.,17,RO005TR03
694,694,"The following night and during that whole week I gave as little thought as I could to the five cantos and, I must confess, I left them ever so peaceful in my desk drawer. I liked talking about everything except money, and principally money that had been found. It wasn’t a crime to find money, however, it was a happy thing, good luck, maybe even a stroke of Providence. It couldn’t be anything else. Five cantos aren’t lost the way you lose a pouch of tobacco. Five cantos are carried with thirty thousand feelings, you keep feeling them, you don’t take your eyes off them, or your hands, or your thoughts, and for them to be lost foolishly like that on a beach it has to be …",17,RO005TR03
695,695,"Finding them can’t be a crime. Neither a crime, nor dishonor, nor anything that might sully a man’s character.

In her bedroom she had a small carved jacaranda prie-dieu, three feet high and with images inside. But she never mentioned it to her friends.

833,833,“He doesn’t drink much even for that reason.”,17,RO005TR03
834,834,"At dinner I belied his words. I drank, more than I was accustomed to. Even so, less than was necessary for me to lose my reason. I was already upset and I became a little more so. It was the first great anger I’d felt for Virgília. I didn’t look at her one single time during dinner. I talked about politics, the press, the ministry, I think I could have talked about theology had I known anything about it or remembered anything. Lobo Neves followed me with great calm and dignity, even with a certain superior benevolence. And all of that irritated me too and rendered the dinner all the more bitter and long. I took my leave as soon as we got up from the table.",17,RO005TR03

840,840,"I wandered through the streets and retired at nine o’clock. Unable to sleep, I set about reading and writing. At eleven o’clock I was sorry I hadn’t gone to the theater, consulted the clock, wanted to get dressed and go out. I calculated that I’d get there too late, however. Besides, it would be a proof of weakness. Obviously Virgília was beginning to be annoyed with me, I thought. And that idea made me desperate and cold successively, ready to forget her and to kill her.",17,RO005TR03
841,841,"I could see her from there, reclining in her box with her magnificent arms bare—the arms that were mine, only mine—fascinating everyone’s eyes with the superb dress she must have had on, her milky white breast, her hair in tight curls in the style of the time, and her diamonds, less brilliant than her eyes … I saw her like that and it pained me that others should see her. Then I began to undress her, put the jewels and silks aside, undo her hair with my voracious and lascivious hands, making her—I don’t know whether more beautiful or more natural—making her mine, only mine, nothing but mine.",17,RO005TR03
842,842,"The next day I couldn’t stand it. I went to Virgília’s early, found her with eyes red from weeping.",17,RO005TR03
843,843,“What happened?” I asked.,17,RO005TR03
844,844,"“You don’t love me,” was her answer. “You’ve never shown me the slightest sign of love. Yesterday you treated me as if you hated me. If I only knew what I’d done! But I don’t know. Won’t you tell me what it was?”",17,RO005TR03
845,845,“What what was? I don’t think there was anything.”,17,RO005TR03
846,846,“Wasn’t anything? You treated me like a dog …”,17,RO005TR03

848,848,"“It’s over, it’s all right,” I said.",17,RO005TR03
849,849,"I didn’t have the heart to argue and, besides, argue about what? It wasn’t her fault if her husband loved her. I told her that she hadn’t done anything to me, that I was necessarily jealous of the other man, that I couldn’t always bear him with a happy face. I added that maybe there was a lot of pretending on his part and the best way to shut the door on battles and disagreements was to accept my idea of the day before.",17,RO005TR03
850,850,"“I thought about it,” Virgília repled. “A little house all our own, by itself, in the middle of a garden on some back street, isn’t that it? I liked the idea, but why run away?”",17,RO005TR03
851,851,"She said that with the ingenuous and casual tone of someone who can think no evil, and the smile that slackened the corners of her mouth carried the same innocent expression. Then pushing me away, she retorted:",17,RO005TR03

855,855,"Virgília began to weep, and so as not to attract anyone’s attention she put her handkerchief into her mouth, suppressed her sobs in an outburst that disconcerted me. If anyone had heard her everything would have been lost. I leaned toward her, took her by the wrists, whispered the sweetest names of our intimacy to her. I pointed out the danger. The fear calmed her down.",17,RO005TR03
856,856,"“I can’t,” she said after a few moments, “I can’t leave my son. If I took him along I’m sure he’d follow me to the ends of the earth. I can’t. Kill me if you want, or let me die … Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!”",17,RO005TR03

859,859,"She was still upset. I asked her to forget everything, to forgive me, that I was mad but that my insanity was because of her and would end because of her.

862,862,We were interrupted by the sound of a coach in the yard. A slave came in to announce the arrival of Baroness X. Virgília consulted me with her eyes.,17,RO005TR03
863,863,"“If you have a headache like that, madam,” I said, “I should think it would be best not to receive her.”",17,RO005TR03

868,868,"“How good to see you!” she exclaimed. “Where have you been hiding, sir, that you never appear anywhere? Why, just yesterday I was surprised not to see you at the theater. Candiani was a delight. What a woman! Do you like Candiani? Naturally. Men are all alike. The baron was telling me last night in our box that a single Italian woman is worth five Brazilian women. Such impertinence! And the impertinence of an old man, which is worse. But why didn’t you go to the theater last night?”",17,RO005TR03
869,869,“A migraine.”,17,RO005TR03
870,870,"“Hah! Some love affair, don’t you think, Virgília? Well, my friend, you’d better hurry up because you must be forty … or close to it … Aren’t you forty years old?”",17,RO005TR03
871,871,"“I can’t say with certainty,” I replied, “but if you’ll excuse me, I’ll go check my baptism certificate.”",17,RO005TR03
872,872,"“Get along with you …” And holding out her hand to me, “Until what next time? We’ll be at home on Saturday. The baron misses you …",17,RO005TR03
873,873,"Out on the street I was sorry I’d left. The baroness was one of the people who was most suspicious of us. Fifty-five years old and looking forty, sleek, smiling, vestiges of beauty, elegant bearing, and refined manners. She didn’t talk a lot or all the time. She possessed the great skill of listening to others, spying on them. At those times she would sit back in her chair, unsheathe her long, sharp vision, and take her ease.",17,RO005TR03
874,874,"The others, not knowing what was going on, would talk, look, gesticulate, while she would simply look, sometimes staring, sometimes moving her eyes, carrying the ruse to the point of looking inside herself sometimes because she would let her eyelids droop but since eyelashes are lattices, her glance would continue its work, rummaging in the souls and lives of others.",17,RO005TR03
875,875,"The second person was a relative of Virgília’s, Viegas, a worthless old man of seventy winters, sucked dry and yellowish, who suffered from a chronic case of rheumatism, no less chronic asthma, and a heart lesion. He was a walking hospital ward. His eyes, however, gleamed with plenty of life and health. Virgília, during the first weeks, wasn’t afraid of him at all. She told me that when Viegas seemed to be watching with his stare, he was simply counting money. He was, in fact, a great miser.",17,RO005TR03
876,876,"There was still Virgília’s cousin, Luís Dutra, whom I disarmed now by dint of talking to him about his prose and poetry and introducing him to acquaintances. When the latter, linking the name to the person, showed themselves to be pleased with the introduction, there was no doubt but that Luís Dutra overflowed with happiness. And I made use of that happiness with the hope that he would never catch us. There were, finally, two or three ladies, several fops, and the servants, who naturally would avenge themselves for their servile status in that way, and all of them constituted a veritable forest of eyes and ears among which we had to slip along with the tactics and subtlety of serpents.",17,RO005TR03

I was in the habit of dining there. But, not having deliberately walked there, I deserved no credit for the act, but my legs, which had done so, did. Blessed legs! And there are those who treat you with disdain or indifference. Even I, until then, held you in low esteem, getting annoyed when you tired, when you couldn’t go beyond a certain point and left me with a desire to flap my wings like a hen tied by the feet.",17,RO005TR03
880,880,"That time, however, it was a ray of light. Yes, legs, my friends, you left the task of thinking about Virgília to my head and you said to one another, “He’s got to eat, it’s dinnertime, let’s take him to the Pharoux. Let’s divide up his consciousness, one part can stay with the lady, we’ll take over the other part so that he goes straight ahead, doesn’t bump into people or carriages, tips his hat to acquaintances, and, finally, arrives safe and sound at the hotel.” And you followed your plan to the letter, kind legs, which obliges me to immortalize you with this page.",17,RO005TR03

887,887,"That letter was a blow. Nevertheless, immediately after nightfall I ran to Virgília’s. I was on time, she regretted it. Through an open window she told me what had happened with the baroness. The baroness had told her quite frankly that there was a lot of talk at the theatre the night before regarding my absence from the Lobo Neves box. They’d commented on my relationship to the house. In short, we were the object of public suspicion. She finished by saying that she didn’t know what to do.",17,RO005TR03

890,890,"I saw that it was impossible to separate two things that were completely linked in her spirit: our love and public opinion. Virgília was capable of equal and great sacrifices to preserve both advantages, and flight left her with only one. I might have had a feeling similar to spite, but the commotion of those two days was already great and the spite quickly died. It’s all set. Let’s arrange the little house.",17,RO005TR03
891,891,"As a matter of fact, I found it a few days later, made to order in a corner of Gamboa. A jewel! New, freshly painted, with four windows in front and two on either side—all with brick-colored blinds—vines at the corners, a garden in front. Mystery and solitude. A jewel!",17,RO005TR03
892,892,"We arranged for a woman known to Virgília, in whose house she’d been a seamstress and servant, to go live there. Virgília held a real enchantment over her. She wouldn’t tell her everything. She’d easily accept the rest.",17,RO005TR03
893,893,"For me this was a new situation in our love, an appearance of exclusive possession, of absolute dominion, something that would soothe my conscience and maintain decorum. I was already tired of the other man’s curtains, chairs, carpet, couch, all the things that constantly brought our duplicity up before my eyes. Now I could avoid the frequent dinners, the teas every night, and, finally, the presence of their son, my accomplice and my enemy.",17,RO005TR03
894,894,"The house rescued me completely. The ordinary world would end at its door. From there on there was the infinite, an eternal, superior, exceptional world, ours, only ours, without laws, without institutions, without any baroness, without eyes, without ears—one single world, one single couple, one single life, one single will, one single affection—the moral unity of all things through the exclusion of those that were contrary to me.",17,RO005TR03

It was because of a black man whipping another in the square. The other one didn’t try to run away. He only moaned these words: “Please, I’m sorry, master. Master, I’m sorry!” but the first one paid no attention and each entreaty was answered with a new lashing.",17,RO005TR03
898,898,"“Take that, you devil!” he was saying. “There’s sorry for you, you drunk!”",17,RO005TR03

They would have been material for a good and maybe happy chapter. I like happy chapters, they’re my weakness. On the outside the Valongo episode was dreadful, but only on the outside. As soon as I stuck the knife of rationality deeper into it I found it to have a happy, delicate, and even profound marrow. It was the way Prudêncio had to rid himself of the beatings he’d received by transmitting them to someone else.",17,RO005TR03

Now that he was free, however, he had the free use of himself, his arms, his legs, he could work, rest, sleep unfettered from his previous status. Now he could make up for everything.

I think she wept at the beginning, was sick with herself. What was certain at least was that she didn’t lift her eyes to me during the first two months. She spoke to me with her look lowered, serious, frowning, sad sometimes. I wanted to win her over and didn’t act offended, treating her with affection and respect. I made a great effort to win her good will, then her trust.",17,RO005TR03

But the book is tedious, it has the smell of the grave about it; it has a certain cadaveric contraction about it, a serious fault, insignificant to boot because the main defect of this book is you, reader. You’re in a hurry to grow old and the book moves slowly. You love direct and continuous narration, a regular and fluid style, and this book and my style are like drunkards, they stagger left and right, they walk and stop, mumble, yell, cackle, shake their fists at the sky, stumble, and fall …",17,RO005TR03

He inquired, investigated, searched about, and came to discover that I was a one-and-only copy … One and only! You people who not only love books but suffer from a mania for them know quite well the value of those words and you can imagine, therefore, my bibliomaniac’s delight. He would reject the crown of the Indies, the Papacy, all the museums of Italy and Holland if he had to trade that one and only copy for them and not because it is that of my Memoirs.

In the end he discovers nothing and contents himself with ownership. He closes the book, looks at it, looks at it again, goes to the window and holds it up to the sun. A one-and-only copy.

She continued doing sewing for the outside and keeping her pots boiling. Her mother was ill-tempered because of her age and her poverty. She railed at her daughter to take on one of the seasonal, temporary husbands who asked for her. And she would roar:",17,RO005TR03

946,946,"Dona Plácida swore to me that she wasn’t waiting for any nobleman. It was her character. She wanted to be married. She knew quite well that her mother hadn’t been and she knew some women who only had lovers. But it was her character and she wanted to be married. She didn’t want her daughter to be anything else either. She worked hard, burning her fingers on the stove and her eyes sewing by the candleholder in order to eat and not lose everything. She grew thin, fell ill, lost her mother, buried her with the help of charity, and kept on working. Her daughter was fourteen, but she was very frail and didn’t do anything except flirt with the sharpers who hung around the window grating. Dona Plácida worried a great deal, taking her with her when she had to deliver sewing jobs. The people in the shops stared and winked, convinced that she’d brought her along in order to catch a husband or something else. Some would make bad jokes, pay their respects. The mother began to get offers of money …",17,RO005TR03

I had nobody else in the world and I was getting old and sick. It was around that time that I got to know Iaiá’s family, good people who gave me something to do and even gave me a home. I was there for several months, a year, over a year, a house servant, sewing. I left when Iaiá got married. Then I lived as God willed it. Look at my fingers, look at these hands …” And she showed her thick, wrinkled hands, the tips of her fingers pricked by needles … “You don’t get this way by chance, sir. God knows how you get this way … Luckily Iaiá took care of me, and you too, doctor … I was afraid of ending up begging on the street …”",17,RO005TR03

From that conjunction of empty sensuality Dona Plácida came into bloom.

Go-between was no better than concubine and I’d lowered her to that position by dint of gifts and money. That was what my conscience was saying to me. I spent a few minutes not knowing how to answer it. It added that I’d taken advantage of the fascination Virgília held over the ex-seamstress, of the latter’s gratitude, ultimately, of her need. It made note of Dona Plácida’s resistance, her tears during the early days, her grim expressions, her silences, her lowered eyes, and my skills at bearing up under all that until I could overcome it. And it tugged at me again in an irritated and nervous way.",17,RO005TR03

She traveled in a coach, her face veiled, wrapped in a kind of collared cape that disguised the curves of her figure. The first time she’d dropped onto the settee, breathing heavily, scarlet, with her eyes on the floor.

Two days before at the baroness’ she’d waltzed twice with the same dandy after listening to his courtly talk in a corner by the window. She was so merry! So open! So self-possessed! When she caught an interrogative and threatening wrinkle between my eyebrows, she showed no surprise, nor did she become suddenly serious, but she threw the dandy and his courtly talk overboard. Then she came over to me, took my arm, and led me into the other room, with fewer people, where she complained of being tired and said many other things with the childlike air she was accustomed to assume on certain occasions and I listened to her almost without replying.",17,RO005TR03

Many things have happened since our encounter. I shall proceed to recount them in detail if you won’t slam the door on me.

The lucidity, the serenity, the conviction—a touch boastful, of course—seemed to eliminate any suspicion of lunacy. Naturally, Quincas Borba had come into an inheritance from some relative of his in Minas Gerais and the abundance had given him back his early dignity. I won’t say entirely so.

He had opinions on many different things, among others the development of the African slave trade and the expulsion of the English. He liked the theater very much.

Fortunately, Sabina seated me next to Damasceno’s daughter, a Dona Eulália, or, more familiarly, Nhã-loló, a charming girl, a little bashful at first, but only at the beginning. She lacked elegance, but she made up for it with her eyes, which were superb and had the only defect of being fixed on me except when they went down to her plate. But Nhã-loló ate so little that she scarcely looked at her meal. Later in the night she sang. Her voice was, as her father had said, “quite lovely.” Nevertheless, I slipped away. Sabina came to the door with me and asked me what I thought of Damasceno’s daughter.",17,RO005TR03
1152,1152,“Nice enough.”,17,RO005TR03
1153,1153,"“Quite nice, don’t you think?” she put in. “She needs a little refining, but what a good heart! She’s a pearl. She’d make a good bride for you.”",17,RO005TR03
1154,1154,“I don’t like pearls.”,17,RO005TR03
1155,1155,"“Grumpy! When are you going to settle down? When you fall off the tree, when you’re ripe, I know. Well, my fine fellow, whether you want to or not, you’re going to marry Nhã-loló.”",17,RO005TR03
1156,1156,"And as she said that she tapped my face with her fingers, light as a dove and at the same time firm and resolute. Good Lord! Could that have been the reason for the reconciliation? I was a bit disconsolate with the idea, but a mysterious voice was calling me to the Lobo Neves house. I said goodbye to Sabina and her threats.",17,RO005TR03

1159,1159,“How’s my darling little mother?”,17,RO005TR03
1160,1160,"At that word Virgília pouted as always. She was by a window, all alone, looking at the moon, and she greeted me merrily, but when I mentioned our child she pouted. She didn’t like that mention, she was bothered by my anticipated paternal caresses. I, for whom she was now a sacred person, a divine ampulla, left her alone. I imagined at first that the embryo, that unknown figure entering into our adventure, had brought back her sense of sin.",17,RO005TR03
1161,1161,"I was wrong. Virgília had never seemed more expansive, less reserved, less concerned about other people and her husband. There was no remorse. I also imagined that the conception might have been nothing but an invention, a way of tying me to her, a recourse that wouldn’t last long and perhaps was beginning to bother her. The hypothesis wasn’t absurd. My sweet Virgília lied sometimes, and so gracefully!",17,RO005TR03
1162,1162,"That night I discovered the real reason. It was fear of childbirth and the annoyance of pregnancy. She’d suffered a great deal with the birth of her first child. During that hour made up of minutes of life and minutes of death, she’d experienced the chills of the gallows in her imagination. As for the annoyance, it was complicated all the more by the forced deprivation of certain habits of her elegant life. That must have been it, most certainly. I gave her to understand that, scolding her a little by my rights as a father. Virgília stared at me. She immediately turned her eyes away and smiled in an incredulous way.",17,RO005TR03

1165,1165,"Where are they, the flowers of yesteryear? One afternoon, after a few weeks of gestation, the whole structure of my paternal dreams crumbled. The embryo went away at the point when you couldn’t tell Laplace from a turtle. I got the news from the mouth of Lobo Neves, who left me in the parlor and accompanied the doctor to the bedroom of the frustrated mother. I leaned against the window, looking out into the yard where the orange trees were green, with no flowers. Where had they gone, the flowers of yesteryear?",17,RO005TR03

1167,1167,The Anonymous Letter,17,RO005TR03
1168,1168,"I felt a touch on my shoulder. It was Lobo Neves. We faced each other for a few minutes, mute, inconsolable. I asked about Virgília, then we stayed chatting for half an hour. At the end of that time they brought him a letter. He read it, turned very pale, and folded it with a trembling hand. I think I noticed a movement in him as if he wanted to pounce on me, but I can’t remember too well. What I do remember clearly is that over the following days he greeted me coldly and taciturnly. A few days later in Gamboa, Virgília finally told me everything.",17,RO005TR03
1169,1169,"Her husband had shown her the letter as soon as she recovered. It was anonymous and it informed on us. It didn’t say everything. It spoke, for example, of our outside meetings. It limited itself to cautioning him about our intimacy and added that the suspicions were a matter of public knowledge. Virgília read the letter and said with indignation that it was a vile libel.",17,RO005TR03
1170,1170,“Libel?” Lobo Neves asked.,17,RO005TR03
1171,1171,“Vile.”,17,RO005TR03
1172,1172,"Her husband took a deep breath, but as he went back to the letter it seemed that every word in it was making a negative sign with its finger, every letter was crying out against his wife’s indignation. That man, otherwise intrepid, was now the most fragile of creatures. Perhaps his imagination was showing him that famous eye of public opinion staring sarcastically at him from a distance with its rascally look. Maybe an invisible voice was repeating into his ear the hints that he’d previously heard or mentioned. He demanded that his wife confess everything to him, because he would forgive her everything.",17,RO005TR03
1173,1173,"Virgília saw that she was safe. She pretended to be irritated over his insistence, swore that she’d only heard words of jest and courtesy from me. The letter must have been from some luckless suitor. And she named a few—one who’d flirted with her openly for three weeks, another who’d written her a letter, and still others, and others. She gave him their names, the circumstances, studying her husband’s eyes and ended up saying that in order not to give the libel any room she’d treat me in such a way that I wouldn’t be coming back.",17,RO005TR03
1174,1174,"I listened to all this a little perturbed, not by the addition of the dissimulation it would be necessary to employ from then on until I kept completely away from the Lobo Neves house, but by Virgília’s moral calm, her lack of upset, fear, memories, and even remorse, Virgília noticed my concern, lifted up my head, because I was staring at the floor then, and told me with a certain bitterness;",17,RO005TR03
1175,1175,“You don’t deserve the sacrifices I’m making for you.”,17,RO005TR03
1176,1176,"I didn’t say anything to her. It was useless to have her ponder how a little despair and terror would give our situation the caustic taste of the early days. But if I told her that it could have been possible that, slowly and artificially, she would reach that touch of despair and terror. I didn’t say anything to her. She was tapping the floor nervously with the tip of her shoe. I went over and kissed her on the forehead. Virgília drew back as if it had been the kiss of a dead man.",17,RO005TR03

1179,1179,"I can sense that the reader has shuddered—or should have shuddered. Naturally, the last words suggested three or four reflections to him. Take a good look at the picture. In a little house in Gamboa two people who’ve been in love for a long time, one leaning over the other, giving her a kiss on the forehead and the other drawing back as if she felt the contact of the mouth of a corpse. There you have in the short space between mouth and forehead, before the kiss and after it, there you have enough room for a lot of things—the contraction of a resentment—the wrinkle of mistrust—or, finally, the pale and drowsy nose of satiety …",17,RO005TR03

1182,1182,"We separated in a happy mood. I dined reconciled with the situation. The anonymous letter was bringing back the salt of mystery and the pepper of danger to our adventure, and in the end it was good that Virgília hadn’t lost her self-control in that crisis. That night I went to the São Pedro Theater. They were putting on a great play in which Estela was bringing out tears. I went in, ran my eyes over the boxes. In one of them I saw Damascene and his family. The daughter was dressed with a new elegance and a certain stylishness, something difficult to explain because the father only earned enough to go into debt. Maybe that was the reason.",17,RO005TR03
1183,1183,"I went to visit them during intermission. Damascene greeted me with lots of words, his wife with lots of smiles. As for Nhã-loló, she didn’t take her eyes off me. She seemed prettier to me than at the time of the dinner. I found in her a certain ethereal softness wedded to the polish of earthly forms—a vague expression and worthy of a chapter in which everything must be vague. Really, I don’t know how to tell you, I didn’t feel too bad beside the girl who was done up smartly in a fine dress, a dress that gave me the itching of a Tartuffe.",17,RO005TR03
1184,1184,"As I contemplated how it chastely and completely covered her knee, I made a subtle discovery, to wit, that nature foresaw human clothing, a condition necessary for the development of our species. Habitual nudity, given the multiplicity of the works and cares of the individual, would tend to dull the senses and retard sex, while clothing, deceiving nature, sharpens and attracts desires, activates them, reproduces them, and, consequently, drives civilization. A blessed custom that gave us Othello and transatlantic packets.",17,RO005TR03
1185,1185,"I had an urge to suppress this chapter. This is a slippery slope. But, after all, I’m writing my memoirs and not yours, my peaceable reader. Alongside the charming maiden I seemed to be taken with a double and indefinable feeling. She was the complete expression of Pascal’s duality, I’ange et la béte, with the difference that the Jansenist wouldn’t admit the simultaneity of the two natures, while there they were quite together—I’ange, who was saying certain heavenly things—and la béte, who … No, I am most certainly going to suppress this chapter.",17,RO005TR03

1188,1188,"In the orchestra seats I found Lobo Neves chatting with some friends. We spoke superficially, coldly, both constrained. But during the next intermission, with the curtain about to go up, we ran into each other in one of the corridors where there was nobody about. He came over to me with great affability and laughter, pulled me into one of the theatre’s bay windows, and we talked for a long time, mostly he, who seemed the most tranquil of men. I got to ask him about his wife. He answered that she was fine, but then he turned the conversation to general matters, expansive, almost jolly. Whoever wants to can make a guess as to the cause of the difference. I fled from Damascene, who was spying on me from the door of his box.",17,RO005TR03
1189,1189,"I didn’t hear any of the second act, neither the words of the actors nor the applause of the audience. Leaning back in my chair I was picking the shreds of my conversation with Lobo Neves out of my memory, re-creating his manners, and I concluded that the new situation was much better. All we needed was Gamboa. Visiting the other house would only sharpen suspicions. We could rigorously go without speaking every day. It was even better, it put the longing during our breaks back into our love. Besides, I was going on forty and I wasn’t anything, not even a district elector. It was urgent that I do something, if only for the love of Virgília, who would be proud to see my name shine … I think that there was loud applause at that moment, but I can’t swear to it. I was thinking about something else.",17,RO005TR03

I let humankind bustle around my body without hearing them, just as the Prometheus of Aeschylus did with his torturers.

But the world of the moon, that luminous and prudent garret of the brain, what else is it if not the disdainful affirmation of our spiritual freedom?

With others I restrict myself to the admission of their probability. An example of the second case is the basis of the present chapter, whose reading I recommend to all people who love the study of social phenomena. It would seem, and it’s not improbable, that there exists between the events of public life and those of private life a certain reciprocal, regular, and perhaps periodic action—or, to use an image, something similar to the tides on the beach in Flamengo and others equally surging. Indeed, when the wave attacks the beach it floods it for several feet inland. But those same waters return to the sea with variable force and go on to form part of the wave about to come and which must return the same as the first. That’s the image. Let’s have a look at its application.",17,RO005TR03
1195,1195,"I said elsewhere that Lobo Neves, nominated for president of a province, had turned down the nomination because of the date of the decree, which was the 13th. A serious act whose consequence was the break between the minister and Virgília’s husband. In that way the private event of the evil omen of a number produced the phenomenon of political discord. It remains to be seen how, sometimes afterward, a political event determined a cessation of motion in private life. Since it’s not suitable to the method of this book to describe that other phenomenon immediately, I shall limit myself for now to say that Lobo Neves, four months after our meeting in the theatre, made up with the minister, a fact that the reader must not lose sight of if he wishes to penetrate the subtlety of my thought.",17,RO005TR03

But that gesture of indifference was contradicted by something less definable, less clear, an expression of pleasure and expectation. I don’t know why, but I imagined that the imperial letter of nomination was capable of drawing her into virtue, I won’t say because of virtue in herself, but out of gratitude for her husband. Because she was sincerely in love with nobility. One of the greatest displeasures to come up in our life was the appearance of a dandy from a legation—let us call it the legation of Dalmatia—Count B. V., who chased after her for three months. That man, a genuine nobleman by blood, had turned Virgília’s head a little, for she, among other things, had a diplomatic vocation. I can’t get to what might have become of me if a revolution hadn’t broken out in Dalmatia that overthrew the government and cleaned out its embassies. The revolution was bloody, painful, formidable. With every ship arriving from Europe the newspapers described the horrors, calculated the bloodshed, counted the heads. Everybody was seething with indignation and pity … Not I.

In the end it seemed to me that it was playing a dangerous game and I asked myself if it wasn’t time to get up and take a little walk. I felt taken by a longing for marriage, by a desire to straighten my life out. Why not? My heart still had things to explore. I didn’t feel incapable of a chaste, austere, pure love. In reality, adventures are the torrential and giddy part of life, the exception, that is. I was weary of them. I may even have felt the prick of some remorse. As soon as I thought about that I let myself go to follow my imagination. I immediately saw myself married, alongside an adorable woman, looking at a baby sleeping in the arms of a nursemaid, all of us in the back of a shady green yard, and peeping at us through the trees was a strip of blue sky, an extremely blue sky …",17,RO005TR03

Could I rob the reader of the pleasure of noting for himself the coldness, the perspicacity, and the spirit of those few lines jotted down in haste and, behind then, the storm of a different brain, the concealed rage, the despair that brings on constraint and meditation, because it must be resolved in the mud, in blood, or in tears?",17,RO005TR03

But if I tell you the upset I had, you might doubt that assertion a bit and not accept it without proof. Neither then nor even now have I been able to make out what I felt. It was fear and it wasn’t fear. It was pity and it wasn’t pity. It was vanity and it wasn’t vanity.

I haven’t forgotten that small circumstance. In the midst of so many important things that were obliterated, that breakfast escaped. The main reason might have been my disaster, but it wasn’t. The main reason was a reflection made to me by Quincas Borba, who visited me that day.",17,RO005TR03

I will only say that if a man’s main characteristic isn’t in his features but in his clothing, he wasn’t Quincas Borba: he was a judge without a robe, a general without a uniform, a businessman without a budget.

As for his mannerisms, without having lost the previous vivacity, they no longer had the disorder and were subject to a certain method. But I don’t wish to describe him. If I were to speak, for example, about his gold stickpin and the quality of the leather of his shoes, it would initiate a description that I am omitting in the name of brevity.

It would descend and the episode on the Passeio Público would receive it with another stroke, equally as firm and effective. I don’t think I was born for complex situations. That pushing and shoving of opposite things was getting me off balance. I had an urge to wrap up Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves, and Virgília’s note in the same philosophy and send them to Aristotle as a gift. Nevertheless, our philosopher’s narrative was instructive.

During the first few days I stayed home, catching flies like Domitian, if Suetonius is telling the truth, but catching them in a particular way, with my eyes. I would catch them one by one, lying in the hammock in the rear of a large room with an open book in my hands. It was everything: nostalgia, ambitions, a bit of tedium, and a lot of aimless daydreaming. My uncle the canon died during that interval along with two cousins. I didn’t feel shocked. I took them to the cemetery as one takes money to the bank. What am I saying? As one takes letters to the post office. I sealed the letters, put them in the box, and left it to the postman to see that they were delivered into the right hands.

1327,1327,"Two forces, however, along with a third, compelled me to return to my usual agitated life. Sabina and Quincas Borba. My sister was pushing the conjugal candidacy of Nhã-loló in a truly impetuous way. When I became aware, I practically had the girl in my arms. As for Quincas Borba, he finally laid out Humanitism for me. It was a philosophical system destined to be the ruination of all others.",17,RO005TR03
1328,1328,"“Humanitas,” he said, “the principle of things, is nothing but man himself divided up into all men. Humanitas has three phases: the static, previous to all creation; the expansive, the beginning things; the dispersive, the appearance of man; and it will have one more, the contractive, the absorption of man and things. The expansion, starting the universe, suggested to Humanitas the desire to enjoy it, and from there the dispersion, which is nothing but the personified multiplication of the original substance.”",17,RO005TR03
1329,1329,"Since that explanation didn’t seem sufficiently clear to me, Quincas Borba developed it in a profound way, pointing out the main lines of the system. He explained to me that on the one side Humanitism was related to Brahmanism, to wit, in the distribution of men throughout the different parts of the body of Humanitas, but what had only a narrow theological and political meaning in the Indian religion, in Humanitism was the great law of personal worth. Thus, descending from the chest or the kidneys of Humanitas, that is, being strong, wasn’t the same as descending from the hair or the tip of the nose. Therefore the necessity to cultivate and temper muscles. Hercules was only an anticipatory symbol of Humanitism.",17,RO005TR03
1330,1330,"At that point Quincas Borba pondered whether or not paganism might have reached the truth if it hadn’t been debased by the amorous part of its myths. Nothing like that will occur with Humanitism. In this new church there will be no easy adventures, or falls, or sadness, or puerile joys. Love, for example, is a priestly function, reproduction a ritual. Since life is the greatest reward in the universe and there’s no beggar who doesn’t prefer misery to death (which is a delightful infusion of Humanitas), it follows that the transmission of life, far from being an occasion of lovemaking, is the supreme moment of the spiritual mass. From all of which there is truly only one misfortune: that of not being born.",17,RO005TR03
1331,1331,"“Imagine, for example, that I had not been born,” Quincas Borba went on. “It’s positive that I wouldn’t be having the pleasure of chatting with you now, of eating this potato, of going to the theatre, or, to put it all into one word, living. Note that I’m not making a man a simple vehicle of Humanitas. He is vehicle, passenger, and coachman all at the same time. He is Humanitas itself in a reduced form. It follows from that that there is a need for him to worship himself. Do you want a proof of the superiority of my system? Think about envy. There is no moralist, Greek or Turkish, Christian or Muslim, who doesn’t thunder against the feeling of envy. Agreement is universal, from the fields of Idumea to the heights of Tijuca.",17,RO005TR03
1332,1332,"So, then, let go of old prejudices, forget about shabby rhetoric, and study envy, that ever so subtle and so noble feeling. With every man a reduction of Humanitas, it’s clear that no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, whatever contrary appearances may be. Thus, for example, the headsman who executes the condemned man can excite the vain clamor of poets. But, substantially, it is Humanitas correcting in Humanitas an infraction of the law of Humanitas. I will say the same of an individual who disembowels another. It’s a manifestation of the force of Humanitas. There is nothing to prevent (and there are examples) his being disemboweled just the same. If you’ve understood well, you will easily understand that envy is nothing but an admiration that fights, and since fighting is the main function of humankind, all bellicose feelings are the ones that best serve its happiness. It follows, then, that envy is a virtue.”",17,RO005TR03

1334,1334,"Why deny it? I was flabbergasted. The clarity of the exposition, the logic of the principles, the rigor of the deductions, all of that seemed great to the highest degree, and it became necessary for me to break off the conversation for a few minutes while I digested the new philosophy. Quincas Borba couldn’t conceal the satisfaction of his triumph. He had a chicken wing on his plate and he was gnawing on it with philosophical serenity. I voiced a few objections still, but they were so feeble that he didn’t waste much time in knocking them down.",17,RO005TR03
1335,1335,"“In order to understand my system well,” he concluded, “it’s necessary never to forget the universal principle, distributed and summed up in every man. Look. War, which looks like a calamity, is a convenient operation, which we could call the snapping of Humanitas’ fingers; hunger (and he sucked philosophically on his chicken wing), hunger is proof that Humanitas is subject to its own entrails. But I don’t need any other documentation of the sublimity of my system than this chicken right here.",17,RO005TR03
1336,1336,"It nourished itself on corn, which was planted by an African, let us suppose imported from Angola. That African was born, grew up, was sold. A ship brought him here, a ship built of wood cut in the forest by ten or twelve men, propelled by sails that eight or ten men sewed together, not to mention the rigging and other parts of the nautical apparatus. In that way, this chicken, which I have lunched on just now, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles carried out with the sole aim of satisfying my appetite.”",17,RO005TR03
1337,1337,"Between cheese and coffee Quincas Borba demonstrated to me how his system meant the destruction of pain. Pain, according to Humanitism, is pure illusion. When a child is threatened with a stick, even before being struck, he closes his eyes and trembles. That predisposition is what constitutes the basis of the human illusion, inherited and transmitted. It’s not enough, of course, to adopt the system in order to do away with pain immediately, but it is indispensable. The rest is the natural evolution of things. Once man gets it completely into his head that he is Humanitas itself, there’s nothing else to do but raise his thought up to the original substance in order to prevent any painful sensation. The evolution is so profound, however, that it can only take place over a few thousand years.",17,RO005TR03
1338,1338,"For a few days after that Quincas Borba read me his magnum opus. It consisted of four handwritten volumes, a hundred pages each, in a cramped hand and with Latin quotations. The last volume was a political treatise based on Humanitas. It was, perhaps, the most tedious part of the system, since it was conceived with a formidable rigor of logic.",17,RO005TR03

Since Damasceno lived in Cajueiros, I would accompany him to mass many times. The hill was still bare of houses except for the old mansion on top where the chapel was. So, one Sunday as I was descending with Nhã-loló on my arm, some kind of phenomenon, I don’t know what, took place, taking off two years here, four there, then five farther on, so that when I got to the bottom I was only twenty years old, just as lively as I had been at that age.",17,RO005TR03
1370,1370,"Now, if you want to know under what circumstances the phenomenon took place, all you have to do is read this chapter to the end. We were coming from mass, she, her father, and I. Halfway down the hill we came upon a group of men. Damasceno, who was walking beside us, noticed what it was and went ahead, all excited. We followed along. And this is what we saw: men of all ages, sizes, and colors, some in shirtsleeves, others wearing jackets, others in tattered frock coats, in different positions, some squatting, others with their hands on their knees, these sitting on stones, those leaning against the wall, and all watching the center, with their souls leaning out of the windows of their eyes.",17,RO005TR03

I saw the two contenders, two roosters with sharp spurs, fiery eyes, and filed beaks. Both were shaking their bloody combs, The breasts of both were without feathers and ruddy colored, weariness was coming over them. But they kept on fighting, eyes staring at eyes, beak down, beak up, a peck from this one, a peck from that, quivering and enraged. Everything else was lost for Damasceno. The spectacle had eliminated the whole universe for him. I told him in vain that it was time to go down. He didn’t answer, he didn’t hear, he was concentrating on the duel. Cockfights were one of his passions.",17,RO005TR03
1373,1373,"It was on that occasion that Nhã-loló tugged me softly on the arm, saying we should be on our way. I accepted her advice and went on with her. I’ve already said that the hill was uninhabited at the time. I also said that we were coming from mass, and since I didn’t say it was raining, it was clear that the weather was good, a delightful sun. And strong. So strong that I immediately opened the parasol, held it by the center of the handle, and tilted in a way that was an aid to a page out of Quincas Borba’s philosophy: Humanitas kissed Hurnanitas … That was how the years fell away from me on the way downhill.",17,RO005TR03
1374,1374,"We stopped at the base for a few minutes waiting for Damascene. He arrived after a while, surrounded by bettors and commenting with them about the fight. One of them, the holder of the bets, was distributing a bundle of old ten tostão notes, which the winners took with redoubled joy. As for the roosters, they came along under the arms of their respective owners. One of them had his comb so badly pecked away and bloody that I recognized him immediately as the loser, but I was mistaken—the loser was the other one, who had no comb at all. They both had their beaks open and had trouble breathing, exhausted. The bettors, on the other hand, were merry in spite of the strong commotion of the fight. They recounted the lives of the contenders, recalled the deeds of both. I went along in vexation. Nhã-loló was especially vexed.",17,RO005TR03

The ease with which he’d joined the bettors brought out old habits and social affinities and Nhã-loló had become afraid that a father-in-law like that would seem unworthy to me. The difference she was making in herself was notable. She would study herself and study me. Elegant and polished life attracted her, principally because she thought it the surest way to blend our personalities. Nhã-loló would observe, imitate, and guess. At the same time she undertook an effort to conceal her family’s inferiority. On that day, however, her father’s display was so great that it made her quite sad. I then sought to get her mind off the matter, telling her a string of jokes and jests, all in good taste. A vain effort that didn’t make her any happier. Her depression was so deep, she was so obviously downcast, that I came to see in Nhã-loló the positive intention of separating her cause from her father’s cause in my mind. I thought that a most elevated feeling. It was one more affinity we had in common.",17,RO005TR03

He listened to me and answered seriously that he had no opinions when it came to his relatives. They might imagine some special interest if he happened to praise the rare qualities of Nhã-loló. That’s why he kept quiet. Furthermore, he was sure that his niece had a real passion for me, but if she consulted him his advice would be negative. It wasn’t brought about by any hate, he appreciated my good qualities—they couldn’t be more praiseworthy, it was true, and as for Nhã-loló, he could never deny that she was an excellent bride, but from there to advise marriage there was a wide gap.",17,RO005TR03

They accused him of avarice and I think they were right, but avarice is only the exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues should serve as evaluations. Oversupply is better than deficit. Since he was very cold in his manners, he had enemies who even accused him of being a barbarian.",17,RO005TR03

But, alongside the fact that he only sent recalcitrants and runaways, it so happens that, having been long involved in the smuggling of slaves, he’d become accustomed to a certain way of dealing that was a bit harsher than the business required, and one can’t honestly attribute to the original nature of a man what is simply the effect of his social relations.",17,RO005TR03
1389,1389,"The proof that Cotrim had pious feelings could be found in his love for his children and the grief he suffered when Sara died a few months after that. Irrefutable proof, I think, and not the only one. He was the treasurer of a confraternity and brother in several brotherhoods and even a redeemed brother in one of them, which doesn’t jibe too well with his reputation for avarice.

I do believe (and here I give him the highest praise) that he only practiced those occasional charities with an aim to arousing the philanthropy of others, and if such was his intent, I must confess that publicity is a sine qua non.

But I don’t have any chemical apparatus, just as I didn’t have any remorse. What I had was the desire to be a minister of state. Therefore, if I am to finish this chapter, I must say that I didn’t want to be either Achilles or Lady Macbeth, and that if I had to be either one, better Achilles, better dragging the corpse in triumph than carrying the spot.

But I’ve already given the reasons for masculine indiscretion: before that interest in security there was another, that of pride, which is more intimate, more immediate. The first was reflexive, with the supposition of a previous syllogism. The second was spontaneous, instinctive, it came from the subject’s insides. Finally, the first had a remote effect, the second a close one. Conclusion: Helvetius’ principle is true in my case. The difference is that it wasn’t a case of apparent interests but the hidden ones.",17,RO005TR03

1452,1452,"I still haven’t told you—but I’ll say it now—that when Virgília was going down the steps and the naval officer touched me on the shoulder, I was fifty years old. It was, therefore, my life that was going downstairs—or the best part of it at least, a part full of pleasures, agitations, frights—disguised with dissimulation and duplicity—but, all in all, the best if we must speak in the usual terms. If, however, we employ other, more sublime ones, the best part was what remained, as I shall have the honor of telling you in the few pages left in this book.",17,RO005TR03
1453,1453,"Fifty! It wasn’t necessary to confess it. You’re already getting the feeling that my style isn’t as nimble as it was during the early days. On that occasion, when the conversation with the naval officer came to an end and he put on his cape and left, I must confess that I was left a bit sad. I went back to the main room. I felt like dancing a polka, being intoxicated by the lights, the flowers, the chandeliers, the pretty eyes, and the quiet and sprightly bubble of individual conversations. And I’m not sorry. I was rejuvenated. But a half hour later, when I left the ball at four in the morning, what did I find inside the coach? My fifty years. There they were, insistent, not numb from the cold, not rheumatic—but dozing off from fatigue, a little longing for bed and rest. Then—and just look to what point the imagination of a sleepy man can reach—then I seemed to hear from a bat who was climbing up the roof of the vehicle: Mr. Brás Cubas, the rejuvenation was in the room, the chandeliers, the lights, the silk—in short, in other people.",17,RO005TR03

Fifty years old! It isn’t invalidism yet, but it’s no longer sprightliness. With ten more years I’ll understand what an Englishman once said, I’ll understand that “it’s a matter of not finding anyone who remembers my parents and the way in which I must face my own OBLIVION.”",17,RO005TR03
1457,1457,"Put that name in small caps. OBLIVION! It’s only proper that all honor be paid to a personage so despised and so worthy, a last-minute guest at the party, but a sure one. The lady who dazzled at the dawn of the present reign knows it and, even more painfully, the one who displayed her charms in bloom during the Paraná ministry, because the latter is closer to triumph and she is already beginning to feel that others have taken her carriage.",17,RO005TR03

She won’t seek in the looks of today the same greeting as in yesterday’s looks, when it was others who took part in the march of life with a merry heart and a swift foot. Tempora mutantur. She understands that this whirlwind is like that, it carries off the leaves of the forest and the rags of the road without exception or mercy. And if she has a touch of philosophy she won’t envy but will feel sorry for the ones who have taken her carriage because they, too, will be helped down by the footman OBLIVION.

But that philosopher, with the elevated good sense he had at his disposal, shouted at me that I was sliding down the fatal slope of melancholy.",17,RO005TR03
1465,1465,"“My dear Brás Cubas, don’t let yourself be overcome by those vapors. Good Lord! You’ve got to be a man! Be strong! Fight! Conquer! Dominate! Fifty is the age of science and government. Courage, Brás Cubas. Don’t turn fool on me. What have you got to do with that succession from ruin to ruin, from flower to flower? Try to savor life. And be aware that the worst philosophy is that of the weeper who lies down on the riverbank to mourn the incessant flow of the waters. Their duty is never to stop. Make an adjustment to the law and try to take advantage of it.”",17,RO005TR03
1466,1466,"The value of the authority of a great philosopher is found in the smallest things. Quincas Borba’s words had the special virtue of shaking me out of the moral and mental torpor I was caught up in. Let’s get to it. Let’s get into the government, it’s time. Up till then I hadn’t participated in the great debates. I was courting a minister’s portfolio by means of flattery, teas, commissions, and votes. And the portfolio never came. It was urgent that I make a speech.",17,RO005TR03
1467,1467,"I began slowly. Three days later during the discussion of the budget for the ministry of justice, I took advantage of an opening to ask the minister modestly if it wouldn’t be useful to reduce the size of the National Guard’s shakos. The object of the question wasn’t far-reaching, but even so I demonstrated how it wasn’t unworthy of the cogitations of a statesman and I cited Philopaemen, who ordered the replacement of his troops’ shields, which were small, by other larger ones, and also their spears, which were too light, a fact that history didn’t find out of line with the gravity of its pages.",17,RO005TR03
1468,1468,"The size of our shakos called for a profound cut, not only to make them more stylish, but also to make them more hygienic. On parade in the sun the excessive heat they produce could be fatal. Since it was a well-known fact that it was a precept of Hippocrates that a person should keep his head cool, it seemed cruel to oblige a citizen, from the simple consideration of being in uniform, to risk his health and his life and, consequently, the future of his family.",17,RO005TR03
1469,1469,"The chamber and the government should keep in mind that the National Guard is the rampart of freedom and independence, and that a citizen called up for service freely given, frequent, and arduous, had the right to have the onus of it lessened by a decree calling for a light and easy-fitting uniform.",17,RO005TR03

And I concluded with this idea: the weeping willow, which bends its branches toward the earth, is a graveyard tree. The palm tree, erect and firm, is a tree of the wilderness, public squares, and gardens.",17,RO005TR03
1472,1472,"The impressions made by the speech were varied. As regards the form, the quick eloquence, the literary and philosophical part, the opinion was unanimous. Everyone told me it was perfect and that no one had ever been able to extract so many ideas from a shako. But the political part was considered deplorable by many. Some thought my speech was a parliamentary disaster. Lastly, they told me that others now considered me in the opposition, among them oppositionists in the chamber who went so far as to hint that it was a convenient moment for a vote of no confidence.",17,RO005TR03
1473,1473,"I energetically rejected such an interpretation, which was not only erroneous but libelous in view of my prominent support of the cabinet. I added that the need to reduce the size of the shako was not so great that it couldn’t wait a few years and, in any case, I was ready to compromise in the extent of the cut, being content with three-quarters of an inch or less. In the end, even though my idea wasn’t adopted, it sufficed for me to have it introduced in parliament.",17,RO005TR03

If the passion for power is the strongest of all, as some say, imagine the despair, the pain, the depression on the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies. All my hopes left: me, my political career was over. And take note that Quincas Borba, through philosophical inductions he made, found that my ambition wasn’t a true passion for power, but a whim, a desire to have some fun.",17,RO005TR03
1491,1491,"In his opinion that feeling, no less profound than the other one, is much more vexing because it matches the love women have for lace and coiffures. A Cromwell or a Bonaparte, he added, for the very reason that they were burning with the passion for power, got there by sheer strength, either by the stairs on the right or the ones on the left. My feelings weren’t like that. Not having that same strength in themselves, they didn’t have certainty in the results and that was why there was greater affliction, greater disappointment, greater sadness.

It was one o’clock in the afternoon, we were in my study, a lovely room that looked out on the backyard, good books, objets d’art, a Voltaire among them, a bronze Voltaire who on that occasion seemed to be accentuating the sarcastic little smile with which he was looking at me, the scoundrel, excellent chairs.

The words of that great man were the stimulating brandy of wisdom. He told me that I couldn’t run away from the fight. If the oratorical rostrum was closed to me, I should start a newspaper. He came to use less elevated speech, showing that philosophical language can, now and then, fortify itself with the slang of the people.

There were two of them. I notice that there was a bone under their feet, the motive for their war, and I couldn’t help having my attention called to the fact that there was no meat on the bone. Just a naked bone. The dogs were biting each other, growling, with fury in their eyes … Quincas Borba put his cane under his arm and seemed ecstatic.",17,RO005TR03

I noticed that Quincas had been truly happy, even though he held his happiness in as befits a great philosopher. He made me observe the beauty of the spectacle, recalled the object of contention, concluded that the dogs were hungry. But deprivation of food was nothing for the general effects of philosophy. Nor did he forget to remember that in some parts of the world the spectacle is on a grander scale: human beings are the ones who fight with dogs over bones and other less appetizing tidbits. A fight that becomes quite complicated because entering into action is man’s intelligence along with the whole accumulation of sagacity that the centuries have given him, etc.",17,RO005TR03

He says that man has ‘a great advantage over the rest of the universe; he knows that he is going to die, while the universe is completely ignorant of the fact.’ Do you see? The man who fights over a bone with a dog, has the great advantage over him of knowing that he’s hungry. And that’s what makes it a grand fight, as I was saying.",17,RO005TR03

Sabina tapped the tips of her fingers with her fan, lowered her head, and picked up the matter again, alternating between pleas and threats. I told her no, no, no.

1553,1553,"I published the newspaper. Twenty-four hours later a declaration by Cotrim appeared in other papers saying in substance that given the fact that he was not a member of either of the parties into which the nation was divided, he found it expedient to make it quite clear that he had no influence on or any direct or indirect part in the journal of his brother-in-law Dr. Brás Cubas, whose ideas and political directions he disapproved of. The present government (like any other composed of equally competent members) seemed to him to be working for the public good.",17,RO005TR03
1554,1554,"It was hard for me to believe my eyes. I rubbed them once or twice and reread the inopportune, unusual, and enigmatic declaration. If he had nothing to do with the parties, what was an incident as minor as the publication of a newspaper to him? Not all citizens who find a government good or bad make declarations like that to the press, nor are they obliged to do so. Really, Cotrim’s intrusion into that affair was a mystery, no less than his personal attack. Our relations until then had been smooth and pleasant. I. couldn’t remember any dissension, any shadow, anything, after the reconciliation.",17,RO005TR03
1555,1555,"On the contrary, the memory was one of genuine good will. As, for example, when I was a deputy I was able to obtain some supply contracts for the naval arsenal for him, contracts that he continued fulfilling with the greatest punctuality and concerning which he spoke to me a few weeks earlier, saying that at the end of three more years they might bring him two hundred contos. Well, then, shouldn’t the memory of such a large favor be enough to stop him from going public and tarnishing his brother-in-law’s reputation? The reasons behind his declaration must have been very powerful in order to make him commit an act of impertinence and an act of ingratitude at the same time. I must confess, it was an unsolvable problem.",17,RO005TR03

1561,1561,"“You can’t deny one fact,” he said, “which is that the pleasure of the benefactor is always greater than that of the benefactee. What is a benefit? It’s an act that brings a certain deprivation of the one benefited to an end. Once the essential effect has been produced, once the deprivation has ceased, that is, the organism returns to its previous state, a state of indifference. Just suppose that the waist of your trousers is too tight. In order to relieve the uncomfortable situation you unbutton the waist, you breathe, you enjoy an instant of pleasure, the organism returns to indifference and you forget about the fingers that performed the operation.",17,RO005TR03
1562,1562,"If there’s nothing that lasts, it’s natural that memory should disappear, because it’s not an aerial plant, it needs earth. The hope for other favors, of course, always holds the benefactee in a remembrance of the first one, but that fact, also one of the most sublime that philosophy can find in its path, is explained by the memory of deprivation or, using a different formula, by deprivation’s continuing on in memory, which echoes the past pain and advises alertness for an opportune remedy. I’m not saying that even without this circumstance it doesn’t sometimes happen that the memory of the favor will persist, accompanied by a certain more or less intense affection. But they’re true aberrations with no value whatever in the eyes of a philosopher.”",17,RO005TR03
1563,1563,"“But,” I replied, “if there’s no reason for the memory of the favor to last in the favored, there must be even less in relation to the favorer. I’d like you to explain that point for me.”",17,RO005TR03
1564,1564,"“What’s obvious by its nature can’t be explained,” Quincas Borba replied, “but I’ll say one thing more. The persistence of the benefit in the memory of the one performing it is explained by the very nature of the benefit and its effects. In the first place, there’s the feeling of a good deed and, deductively, the awareness that we’re capable of good acts. In the second place, a conviction of superiority over another being is received, a superiority in status and means, and this is one of the most legitimately pleasant things for the human organism according to the best opinions.",17,RO005TR03

Before leaving the funeral she embraced the coffin with affliction. They came to pull her off and take her away. I tell you, the tears were genuine. I went to the cemetery and, to say it outright, I didn’t feel much like speaking. A stone was stuck in my throat or in my conscience. At the cemetery, most of all when I dropped the spadeful of lime onto the coffin at the bottom of the grave, the dull thud of the lime gave me a shudder, a fleeting one, it’s true, but unpleasant.

Among civilized people they’re an expression of that pious and secret selfishness that induces us to pull out of death a shred at least of the shade that has passed on.

I couldn’t shake the burial ceremony from my eyes or Virgília’s sobs from my ears. The sobs, most of all, had the vague and mysterious sound of a problem. Virgília had betrayed her husband, sincerely, and now she was weeping for him, sincerely. There you have a difficult combination whose trajectory I was unable to follow completely. At home, however, getting out of the carriage, I suspected that the combination was possible and even easy. Gentle Nature! The tax of grief is like Vespasian’s coin: it doesn’t smell of its origins and can be collected just as well from evil as from good. Morality might condemn my accomplice.

I sometimes liked to imagine those contrasts of region, status, and belief. A few days earlier I’d thought about the hypothesis of a social, religious, and political revolution that would transform the Archbishop of Cantuária into a simple tax collector in Petrópolis, and I made long calculations to find out if the tax collector would eliminate the archbishop or if the archbishop would reject the tax collector or what portion of an archbishop could remain in a tax collector or what amount of a tax collector could combine with an archbishop, and so forth. Insoluble questions, apparently, but in reality perfectly soluble if one considers that there can be two archbishops in one archbishop—the one from the bull and the other one.

I laughed at first, but the noble conviction of the philosopher instilled a certain fear in me. The only objection to Quincas Borba’s word was that I didn’t feel crazy, but since crazy people generally have no other concept of themselves, such an objection was worthless. And see now if there isn’t some basis to the popular belief that philosophers are men who are far removed from petty things. The next day Quincas Borba sent an alienist to see me.

They’re all equal with the same vulgarity or weakness. The Christian paradise is a worthy emulation of the Muslim one. And as for Buddha’s Nirvana, it’s nothing more than a concept for paralytics.

I shall only state that it was the most brilliant phase of my life. The pictures in it were sad. They had the monotony of misfortune, which is as boring as that of pleasure, perhaps worse. But the joy given to the souls of the sick and the poor is a recompense of some value. And don’t tell me that it’s negative because the only one receiving it is the one taken care of.

When it was published as a book, I corrected the text in a number of places. Being obliged to look over it again for the third edition,2 I have made a few more amendments and taken out two or three dozen lines. In this form, the work, which seems to have inspired some benevolence on the part of the public, now comes to light once more.",20,RO005TR06

To the former, the late Brás Cubas himself would answer (as readers have seen and shall see in his prologue, which follows) both yes and no, that it was a novel for some and not so for others. As for the latter, the dead man explained himself as follows: “This is a diffuse work, in which I, Brás Cubas, if I have adopted the free form of a Sterne6 or a Xavier de Maistre,7 may have added a few grumbles of pessimism.” All of them traveled: Xavier de Maistre around his room, Garrett in his own land, Sterne in the lands of others. Of Brás Cubas, one might perhaps say that he traveled around life itself.",20,RO005TR06

What comes as no surprise, nor will likely provoke any consternation, is if this book fails to garner even Stendhal’s hundred readers, nor fifty, nor twenty, nor even ten, if that. Ten? Perhaps five. This is, it’s true, a diffuse work, in which I, Brás Cubas, if I have adopted the free form of a Sterne or a Xavier de Maistre, may have added a few grumbles of pessimism. That may well be. The work of a deceased man. I wrote it with the pen of mirth and the ink of melancholy, and it is not difficult to predict what may come of such a union. Add to which the fact that serious people will find in the book some likeness to an out-and-out novel, while frivolous people will not find their usual novel here; it will thus be deprived of the esteem of the serious and the love of the frivolous, which are the two chief pillars of public opinion.",20,RO005TR06

It would be of interest, but tediously lengthy, and superfluous to one’s understanding of the work.

1645,15,"I debated for a time as to whether I ought to open these memoirs at the beginning or at the end—that is, if I would start out with my birth or with my death. Granting that the common practice may be to begin with one’s birth, two considerations led me to adopt a different method: the first is that I am not exactly an author recently deceased, but a deceased man recently an author, for whom the tomb was another cradle; the second is that this would make the writing wittier and more novel. Moses, who also recounted his own death, did not put it at the commencement but at the finish: a radical difference between this book and the Pentateuch.",20,RO005TR06
1646,16,"That being said, I expired at two o’clock in the afternoon on a Friday in the month of August, 1869, at my handsome country home in Catumbi.4 I had seen some sixty-four robust and prosperous years, I was a bachelor, I had around three hundred thousand milréis5 to my name, and I was accompanied to the cemetery by eleven friends. Eleven! True, there had been neither letters nor announcements. What’s more, it was raining—drizzling—a fine, doleful, steady patter, so steady and so doleful that it led one of those faithful at the last to insert this inspired idea into the speech that he delivered at the edge of my grave:",20,RO005TR06
1647,17,"You who knew him, gentlemen, you may join me in saying that nature herself seems to be weeping for the irreparable loss of one of the finest figures to have ever honored humanity. This gloom, these drops from on high, those dark clouds veiling the blue like a mourning band, all this is the raw, wicked pain tearing nature to the quick; all this is a sublime paean to our illustrious deceased.",20,RO005TR06
1648,18,"Good, faithful friend! No, I don’t regret the twenty bonds I left him. And it was thus that I came to the close of my days; it was thus that I set off for Hamlet’s undiscovered country,6 without the young prince’s anguish or doubts, but slowly and falteringly, like one leaving the stage far too late. Late and weary. Some nine or ten people saw me go, among them three ladies: my sister Sabina, married to Cotrim; her daughter, a fair lily of the valley; and . . . —A little patience, please! I’ll soon tell you who the third lady was.",20,RO005TR06
1649,19,"Content yourselves for the moment with the knowledge that this anonymous woman, though no relation of mine, suffered more than those who were. It’s true, she suffered more. I won’t say that she tore her hair with grief or that she rolled across the floor in convulsions. Nor, for that matter, was there anything terribly dramatic about my death . . . A bachelor breathing his last at age sixty-four is hardly the classic tragedy. And even if it were, the least appropriate thing for this anonymous woman to do would have been to reveal her sentiments.7 Standing beside my bed, her eyes glassy, mouth half-open, this pitiful lady could barely credit my extinction.",20,RO005TR06
1650,20,“Dead! dead!” she repeated to herself.,20,RO005TR06
1651,21,"And her imagination, like the storks that an illustrious traveler once saw take flight from the Ilissos, bound for the shores of Africa, heedless of the ruins and the ages—the lady’s imagination also soared over the wreckage of the present to the shores of a youthful Africa . . . Let her go; we shall go later; we shall go when I restore myself to those early years.",20,RO005TR06
1652,22,"For now I want to die peacefully, methodically, hearing the sobbing of the ladies, the low murmuring of the men, the rain drumming on the caladium leaves in the garden, and the piercing sound of a razor being sharpened by a knife grinder, out by the door to a currier’s shop. I swear to you all that this orchestra of death was much less sorrowful than it might seem. After a point, it became positively delightful. Life floundered in my chest like the surging of an ocean swell, my consciousness melted away, I was drifting down into physical and moral immobility, my body becoming a plant, a stone, loam, nothing at all.",20,RO005TR06
1653,23,"I died of pneumonia; if I should say that it was less pneumonia than a grand and useful idea that caused my death, my reader may not believe me, and yet this is the truth. I will lay out the case for you in brief. Judge for yourself.",20,RO005TR06
1654,24,CHAPTER II,20,RO005TR06
1655,25,THE PLASTER,20,RO005TR06
1656,26,"The fact is, one morning when I was out for a walk in the garden, an idea hopped up onto the trapeze in my head. Once hanging there, it began to wave its arms, swing its legs, and perform such daring tumbler’s somersaults as one could scarcely believe. I let myself contemplate it. Suddenly, it took a flying leap and stretched out its legs and arms, forming an X: decipher me or I devour thee.2",20,RO005TR06
1657,27,"This idea was nothing less than the invention of a sublime remedy, an anti-hypochondriacal3 plaster destined to alleviate our melancholy humanity. In the patent application that I subsequently drew up, I called the government’s attention to this genuinely Christian aim. To my friends, I did not deny the pecuniary advantages that were sure to result from the distribution of a product with such sweeping and profound effects.",20,RO005TR06
1658,28,"Now, however, that I am on the other side of life, I can confess it all: what drove me most of all was the gratification it would give me to see in newsprint, showcases, pamphlets, on street corners, and finally on the medicine boxes, those four words: The Brás Cubas Plaster. Why deny it?",20,RO005TR06
1659,29,"I had a weakness for hubbub, banners, pyrotechnics. Modest sorts may reprove this defect in me; I would wager, however, that the clever will grant me this talent. My idea had two faces, like a medal, with one turned toward the public and one toward me. On one side, philanthropy and profit; on the other, a thirst for fame. Let us call it a love of glory.",20,RO005TR06
1660,30,"An uncle of mine, a canon receiving a full prebend, used to say that the love of temporal glory was the ruin of the soul, which ought to covet only the eternal sort. To which another uncle, an officer in one of the old terço infantry regiments, replied that the love of glory was the most authentically human thing in man, and hence his most genuine feature.4",20,RO005TR06
1661,31,Let the reader decide between the military man and the priest; I will return to the plaster.,20,RO005TR06
1662,32,CHAPTER III,20,RO005TR06
1663,33,GENEALOGY,20,RO005TR06
1664,34,"But, now that I’ve spoken of my two uncles, allow me to draw up a brief sketch of my genealogy.",20,RO005TR06
1665,35,"The founder of my family was one Damião Cubas, who flourished in the first half of the eighteenth century. He was a cooper by trade, hailing from Rio de Janeiro, where he would have died in penury and obscurity if he had limited himself to making the cubas, or barrels, that gave him his name. But no; he became a farmer, planted, reaped, and exchanged his products for a pretty and honest penny until he died, leaving a substantial fortune to a son, Luís Cubas.",20,RO005TR06
1666,36,"This young man is truly the start of my forebears—of the forebears that my family would own to—since Damião Cubas was, after all, a cooper, and perhaps even a bad one at that, whereas Luís Cubas studied at Coimbra,1 became a distinguished statesman, and was a personal friend of the viceroy, Count da Cunha.2",20,RO005TR06
1667,37,"Since the name Cubas wafted of cooperage, my father, Damião’s great-grandson, alleged that the cognomen had been given to a knight, a hero of the African campaigns, in recognition of a feat in which he captured three hundred barrels from the Moors. My father was a man of great imagination; he escaped from the cooper’s shop on the wings of wordplay. He was a good man, my father, worthy and loyal like few others. He had a way of putting on airs, it’s true, but who in this world hasn’t wrapped himself in an air or two?",20,RO005TR06
1668,38,"It may be appropriate to note that he resorted to invention only after having tried out falsification; he had initially grafted himself onto the family of my famous namesake, Captain-Major Brás Cubas, who founded the town of São Vicente and died there in 1592, and it was for that reason that he gave me the name Brás.3 The family of the captain-major objected, however, and it was then that my father conjured up the three hundred Moorish barrels.",20,RO005TR06
1669,39,"A few members of my family are still alive—my niece Venância, for example, the lily of the valley, the flower of the ladies of her time; and her father, Cotrim, a fellow who . . . well, let’s not anticipate events; let’s be done with our plaster once and for all.",20,RO005TR06
1670,40,CHAPTER IV,20,RO005TR06
1671,41,THE FIXED IDEA,20,RO005TR06
1672,42,"My idea, after all its somersaults, had become a fixed idea. God save you, reader, from a fixed idea; better a mote in your eye, or even a beam. Look at Cavour;1 it was the fixed idea of Italian unity that killed him. It’s true that Bismarck hasn’t died;2 but it must be said that Nature is a fickle maid and History is an inveterate flirt. For example, Suetonius gave us a Claudius who was a simpleton, or a “pumpkinhead,” as Seneca called him, and a Titus who was deservedly the delight of Rome.",20,RO005TR06
1673,43,"Recently, a professor has come along and found a way to show that of the two Caesars, the truly delightful one was Seneca’s “pumpkinhead.”3 And you, Madame Lucrezia, the flower of the Borgias, while a poet painted you as a Catholic Messalina, along came a skeptical Gregorovius to wash away a great deal of that depiction,4 and while you may not have come out as a lily, neither were you left a swamp. I shall let myself stand somewhere between the poet and the scholar.",20,RO005TR06
1674,44,"Long live history, then, voluble history, which can go every which way; and, returning to fixed ideas, I shall say that they are what make strong men and madmen; wandering, vague, or shimmering ideas make for Claudiuses—in Suetonius’s version, that is.",20,RO005TR06
1675,45,"My idea was fixed, as fixed as . . . Nothing comes to mind that is quite so fixed in this world: perhaps the moon, perhaps the pyramids of Egypt, perhaps the late German Diet. The reader may pick the analogy that suits him the best; go on, pick one, and don’t get your nose out of joint just because we still haven’t arrived at the narrative part of these memoirs. That is where we are headed. I do believe that you prefer anecdotes to meditations, like all the other readers, your comrades, and I believe you do well to prefer them.",20,RO005TR06
1676,46,"Well, that is where we are headed. Nevertheless, it should be said that this book is written unhurriedly, at the pace of a man no longer burdened by the brevity of the age; it is a supinely philosophical work, but of an inconstant philosophy, first austere and just as quickly playful, one that neither edifies nor destroys, neither inflames nor chills, and is nevertheless more than a pastime and less than an apostolate.",20,RO005TR06
1677,47,"All right; straighten out your nose, and let us get back to the plaster. We shall leave history, with her elegant lady’s whims. None of us ever waged the Battle of Salamis5 or wrote the Augsburg Confession;6 for my part, if Cromwell ever comes to mind, it is only to think that His Highness, with the same hand that locked the doors of Parliament, might have forced the Brás Cubas Plaster on the English.7 Do not laugh at the joint triumph of pharmacy and Puritanism.",20,RO005TR06
1678,48,"Who does not know that at the foot of every large, public, prominent flag, there are often a number of other, more modestly proportioned flags, which are hoisted and flutter in the shadow of their larger counterpart, and which quite often survive it? To offer a poor analogy, it is like the rabble, sheltered in the shadow of the feudal castle; the castle fell and the rabble remained. Indeed, they became grand in their own right, a veritable stronghold . . . No, the analogy’s really no good.",20,RO005TR06
1679,49,CHAPTER V,20,RO005TR06
1680,50,IN WHICH A LADY BETRAYS HERSELF,20,RO005TR06
1681,51,"And then, just as I was occupied with preparing and perfecting my invention, I was struck squarely by a draft; I fell ill straightaway and took no steps to cure myself. I had the plaster on the brain; I bore within me the fixed idea of the mad and the strong. I beheld myself from afar, rising up from the mob-thronged ground and ascending into the heavens like an immortal eagle, and when faced with such a stupendous spectacle, no man can feel the pain that pricks at him.",20,RO005TR06
1682,52,"The following day, I was worse; I finally treated myself, but only partially, with no method, care, or persistence; such was the origin of the ill that brought me to eternity. You already know that I died on a Friday, an unlucky day, and I believe to have proven that it was my invention that killed me. Some demonstrations are less lucid, and no less triumphant for it.",20,RO005TR06
1683,53,"It would not have been impossible for me to step over the threshold of a century and appear in the papers, in the company of other Macrobians.2 I was healthy and robust. Suppose that, instead of laying the foundations for a pharmaceutical invention, I had been attempting to piece together the elements of a political institution or a religious reform. The breeze would come along all the same, with far greater efficacy than the human faculty of calculation, and all would be done for.3 Thus goes the lot of men.",20,RO005TR06
1684,54,"With this reflection, I bade farewell to the woman—I won’t call her the most discreet, but certainly the loveliest among her contemporaries—the anonymous woman from the first chapter, the very same, whose imagination, like the storks of the Ilissos . . . She was then fifty-four years old, and she was a ruin, an imposing ruin. Just imagine, reader, that we had loved each other, she and I, many years before, and that one day, having taken ill, I see her appear at my bedroom door . . .",20,RO005TR06
1685,55,CHAPTER VI,20,RO005TR06
1686,56,"CHIMÈNE, QUI L’EÛT DIT? RODRIGUE, QUI L’EÛT CRU?",20,RO005TR06
1687,57,"I see her appear at my bedroom door, pale, shaken, all in black, and pause there for a minute, without the heart to enter, or stayed there by the presence of a man who was with me. From the bed where I lay, I contemplated her for that span of time, forgetting that I said nothing, nor made any sign to her. It had been two years since we had seen each other last, and I saw her now not as she was but as she had been, as we both had been, for some mysterious Hezekiah2 had turned back the sun to our youthful days. The sun turned back, I shook off all my miseries, and this handful of dust, which death was ready to scatter to the eternity of nothingness, triumphed over time, which is the minister of death. Here, no Hebe’s cup could rival simple nostalgia.",20,RO005TR06
1688,58,"Believe me, remembrance is the lesser evil; let none place their faith in present happiness; there’s a bitter drop of Cain’s drool in it. Once time has worn on and the rapture has ceased, then, perhaps only then, may one truly take pleasure in what has passed; when given a choice between two illusions, the better is that which may be enjoyed without pain.",20,RO005TR06
1689,59,"The vision didn’t last long; reality soon asserted itself; the present cast out the past. Perhaps I’ll expound to the reader, in some corner of this book, my theory of human editions. What should be imparted now is that Virgília—her name was Virgília—entered the bedroom, steadfast, with the gravity lent her by her clothes and her years, and came over to my bed. The stranger got up and left. He was a fellow who visited me every day to speak about rates of exchange, colonization, and the need to develop the railways: nothing more enthralling for a dying man.",20,RO005TR06
1690,60,"He left; Virgília stood there; for some time we gazed at each other without uttering a word. Whoever would have thought it? Two great lovers, two unbridled passions, and nothing was left twenty years later; only two withered hearts, devastated by life and sated of it, whether in equal measure I can’t say, but sated all the same. Virgília now possessed the beauty of old age, an austere and maternal air; she was less slender than when I had seen her last, in Tijuca, at a celebration for the Feast of St. John;4 and because she was one of those who hold out to the last, her dark hair was only just beginning to yield to a few silver strands.",20,RO005TR06
1691,61,"“Visiting dead men, are you?” I said to her.",20,RO005TR06
1692,62,"“Dead men, come now!” replied Virgília with a tut. And then, after giving my hands a squeeze: “I’m putting slugabeds out on the street.”",20,RO005TR06
1693,63,"The tearful caresses of yesteryear were gone, but her voice was friendly and sweet. She sat down. I was alone, at home, with only a sick nurse; we could speak to each other without danger. Virgília gave me a drawn-out report of the latest goings-on, narrating them charmingly and seasoning them with a tart dash of gossip; I, on the verge of leaving the world, felt a devilish pleasure in jeering at it, persuading myself that I left nothing behind.",20,RO005TR06
1694,64,"“What ideas you’ve got in your head!” Virgília interrupted, rather put out. “I won’t come back at this rate. Die! All of us must die; that’s what comes of being alive.”",20,RO005TR06
1695,65,"And, looking at the clock:",20,RO005TR06
1696,66,“Goodness! It’s three. I must go.”,20,RO005TR06
1697,67,“So soon?”,20,RO005TR06
1698,68,“Yes; I’ll come by tomorrow or after.”,20,RO005TR06
1699,69,"“That may not be wise,” I retorted. “The invalid is a bachelor, and there are no ladies living in the house . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1700,70,“What about your sister?”,20,RO005TR06
1701,71,"“She’ll come by to spend a few days, but not before Saturday.”",20,RO005TR06
1702,72,"Virgília reflected for a moment, shrugged, and said gravely:",20,RO005TR06
1703,73,"“I’ve grown old! No one takes any notice of me anymore. But to leave no room for suspicion, I’ll come with Nhonhô.”",20,RO005TR06
1704,74,"Nhonhô was a university graduate, the only child of her marriage, who, at the age of five, had been an unconscious accomplice to our love affair. They came together two days later, and I must confess that upon seeing them there in my bedroom, I was taken by a bashfulness that kept me from immediately repaying the young man’s kind words. Virgília guessed me out and said to her son:",20,RO005TR06
1705,75,"“Nhonhô, pay no mind to this sly old fox here; he’s not talking so he can make you believe he’s at death’s door.”",20,RO005TR06
1706,76,"Her son smiled. I believe I smiled as well, and it all ended in pure fun. Virgília was calm and cheerful, with the air of one who had led an immaculate life. No suspicious gaze, no gesture that might betray a thing; she displayed an equanimity of word and spirit and a mastery of herself that struck me as unusual, and perhaps were. When we touched, innocently enough, on the subject of an illicit love affair that was somewhere between secret and public, I saw her speak with disdain and a bit of indignation of the woman in question, who happened to be a friend of hers. Her son felt satisfied, hearing those dignified and forceful words, while I wondered to myself what the sparrowhawks might say of us, if Buffon7 had been born a sparrowhawk . . .",20,RO005TR06

1709,79,THE DELIRIUM,20,RO005TR06
1710,80,"As far as I am aware, no one has ever narrated his own delirium; I shall do so now, and science will thank me for it. If you, my reader, should not be given to the contemplation of such mental phenomena, you may skip the chapter; go straight to the narration. But, incurious as you may be, I can certainly say that it is interesting to know what went on in my head during some twenty or thirty minutes.",20,RO005TR06
1711,81,"First of all, I took on the figure of a Chinese barber, pot-bellied and nimble-fingered, giving a close shave to a mandarin, who paid me for my trouble with pinches and candies: such are the whims of a mandarin.",20,RO005TR06
1712,82,"Shortly thereafter, I felt myself transformed into St. Thomas Aquinas’s Summa Theologica, a volume bound in Moroccan leather, with silver clasps and illustrations; this idea impressed upon my body the most complete immobility; and I still remember that my hands were the clasps of the book, I had crossed them over my stomach, and someone uncrossed them (Virgília, undoubtedly) because the position made me look like a corpse.",20,RO005TR06
1713,83,"Finally, restored to human form, I saw a hippopotamus come up and carry me off. I let myself go, fallen quiet, whether out of fear or trust I cannot say; but presently the gallop became so headlong that I dared to speak, and tactfully remarked that we seemed to be bound for nowhere in particular.",20,RO005TR06
1714,84,"“You’re mistaken,” replied the animal. “We are going to the origin of the ages.”",20,RO005TR06
1715,85,"I hinted that it must be terribly far off; but the hippopotamus either did not understand me or did not hear me, or perhaps feigned one or the other; and when I asked it, seeing that it could speak, whether it was descended from Achilles’ horse or Balaam’s ass,1 it retorted with a gesture peculiar to those two sorts of quadrupeds: it twitched its ears. For my part, I closed my eyes and let myself go where chance would take me.",20,RO005TR06
1716,86,"Now I have no compunctions about confessing that I felt a tickling of curiosity to know where the origin of the ages lay, if it was as mysterious as the origin of the Nile, and principally if it was more or less worth my while than the consummation of those selfsame ages: all these, the reflections of a sick brain. As I kept my eyes closed, I saw nothing of the route; I can recall only that the cold grew keener as the journey proceeded, and that after a time it seemed to me that we were entering the region of eternal ice.",20,RO005TR06
1717,87,"Indeed, I opened my eyes and saw that my animal was galloping across a plain white with snow, with a few snow mountains, snow vegetation, and a number of large snow animals. All snow; we were even chilled by the rays of a snowy sun. I tried to speak, but could only grunt out the following question:",20,RO005TR06
1718,88,“Where are we?”,20,RO005TR06
1719,89,“We’ve already passed Eden.”,20,RO005TR06
1720,90,"“All right, then, let’s stop at Abraham’s tent.”",20,RO005TR06
1721,91,“And turn around?” scoffed my steed by way of an answer.,20,RO005TR06
1722,92,"This was both vexing and confounding. The journey came to strike me as tiresome and outlandish, the cold disagreeable, the means of transport jolting, and the result far from clear. And—a sick man’s musings—even if we should arrive at the destination in question, mightn’t the ages, irritated at having their origin so exposed, crush me between their equally age-old nails?",20,RO005TR06
1723,93,"As these thoughts passed through my mind, we swallowed up the ground and the plain flew past beneath our feet, until the animal came to a halt and I could look around me more calmly. Look, that was all; I saw nothing but the vast whiteness that had now overtaken even the sky itself, which had been blue until then. Here and there was to be seen an enormous, brutish plant, wagging its long leaves in the wind. The silence of that place was like that of the tomb: one might have said that the life in things had fallen stunned in the presence of man.",20,RO005TR06
1724,94,"Did it fall from the sky? Did it rise from the earth? I do not know; I know only that an immense shape, the figure of a woman, appeared to me then, fixing me with eyes as brilliant as the sun. Everything about the figure bore the vastness of the wilds and surpassed the comprehension of the human gaze, as its edges bled away into its surroundings and that which appeared dense was often diaphanous. Stupefied, I said nothing, not even crying out; but after a time, which was brief enough, I asked who she was and what she was called: such was the curiosity born of delirium.",20,RO005TR06
1725,95,“Call me Nature or Pandora; I am your mother and your enemy.”,20,RO005TR06
1726,96,"Upon hearing this last word, I drew back, gripped with fear. The figure let out a peal of laughter, which had the effect of a typhoon around us; the plants writhed and a long moan broke through the hush of the surroundings.",20,RO005TR06
1727,97,"“Do not be frightened,” said she, “my enmity does not kill; it affirms itself through life. You are alive: I desire no other torment.”",20,RO005TR06
1728,98,"“I’m alive?” I asked, digging my nails into my palms as if to certify myself of my existence.",20,RO005TR06
1729,99,"“Yes, worm, you are alive. You must not fear losing the tattered rags that are your pride; for a few hours yet you shall still taste the bread of pain and the wine of misery. You are alive: now, even in your madness, you are alive; and should your mind retrieve an instant of sense, you will say that you wish to live.”",20,RO005TR06
1730,100,"Thus saying, the vision extended an arm, seized me by the hair, and lifted me up as if I were a feather. Only then could I behold her face, which was immense. Nothing could be stiller; no violent grimace, no expression of hate or ferocity; its sole expression, general and all-pervasive, was that of a selfish impassivity, an everlasting deafness, an immovable will. Wrath, if she had any, was locked away in her heart. At the same time, in that face, with its glacial expression, there was an air of youth, a mixture of strength and vigor before which I felt myself the feeblest and most decrepit of all beings.",20,RO005TR06
1731,101,“Do you understand me?” she said after a time of mutual contemplation.,20,RO005TR06
1732,102,"“No,” I answered, “nor do I wish to understand you; you’re absurd, you’re a fable. I’m dreaming, surely, or, if it should be true that I’ve gone mad, you’re nothing more than a lunatic’s fancy, a vain thing that an absent mind can neither govern nor touch. You, Nature? The Nature I know is only a mother, no enemy; she does not make life a torment, nor is her face as indifferent as the tomb. And why Pandora?”",20,RO005TR06
1733,103,"“Because I carry in my bag all good and evil, and the greatest thing of all, hope, the comfort of men. Do you tremble?”",20,RO005TR06
1734,104,“Yes; your gaze is mesmerizing.”,20,RO005TR06
1735,105,"“Indeed; for I am not only life, I am also death, and you are about to return what I have lent you. For you, great hedonist, there await all the sensual pleasures of nothingness.”",20,RO005TR06
1736,106,"As that last word rolled like a thunderclap across the immense valley, it struck me that this was the last sound that would ever reach my ears; I seemed to feel myself suddenly disintegrating. I faced her with a pleading gaze and asked for a few more years.",20,RO005TR06
1737,107,"“Wretched minute!” she exclaimed. “Why would you want a few more moments of life? To devour and then be devoured? Have you not tired of the spectacle, of the struggle? You have had your fill of all of the least vile and least grievous things I have to offer: the breaking of day, the melancholy of dusk, the quiet of night, the face of the earth, and, last of all, sleep, the greatest benefit my hands can bestow. What more can you want, sublime idiot?”",20,RO005TR06
1738,108,"“Just to live. I ask nothing more. Who but you put this love of life in my heart? And if I love life, why must you do yourself injury by killing me?”",20,RO005TR06
1739,109,"“Because I have no more need of you. Time cares not for the passing minute, only that which is to come. The minute ahead is strong, merry, believes it is the bearer of eternity, and it, too, bears death and perishes like the one before it—but time remains. Selfishness, you say? Yes, selfishness, I know no other law. Selfishness, preservation. A jaguar kills a calf because the jaguar reasons that she must live, and if the calf’s flesh is tender, so much the better: this is the statute that governs the universe. Come up and see.”",20,RO005TR06
1740,110,"So saying, she swept me up and bore me to the top of a mountain. I turned my eyes down one of its slopes and contemplated at length, far off and through a mist, an incomparable thing. Imagine, reader, all the ages of time in miniature, and in an unending procession; all the races, all the passions, the tumult of empires, the war of appetite against appetite and hatred against hatred, the reciprocal destruction of beings and things. Such was the spectacle, a cruel and curious one.",20,RO005TR06
1741,111,"The history of man and the earth was of an intensity of which neither imagination nor science could conceive, for science is too slow and imagination too vague, and what I beheld then was the living condensation of all time. To describe it, one would have to make the lightning stand still. The ages marched along in a whirlwind, and, nevertheless, as delirium lends one different eyes, I could see everything that passed before me, torments and delights, from that thing called glory to that other thing called misery, and I saw love multiplying misery, and misery aggravating weakness.",20,RO005TR06
1742,112,"There came all-consuming greed, maddening wrath, slavering envy, the hoe and the pen, both damp with sweat, and ambition, hunger, vanity, melancholy, riches, love, and they all shook man like a rattle until they destroyed him like a rag. These were the various forms of a single ailment, which would gnaw at the entrails at times and the mind at others, all the while parading its harlequin’s garb around the human species. Pain gave way here and there, but only to indifference, which was a dreamless sleep, or to pleasure, which was a bastard pain.",20,RO005TR06
1743,113,"And then man, tormented and unyielding, would run ahead of the fatality of things after a nebulous, elusive figure cobbled together out of scraps, a scrap of the intangible, another of the improbable, another of the invisible, all sewn with flimsy stitches by the needle of the imagination; and this figure—nothing less than the chimera of happiness—either fled constantly or allowed itself to be caught by its train, upon which man would clasp it to his breast, and then the figure would give a scornful laugh and vanish like an illusion.",20,RO005TR06
1744,114,"Upon contemplating this calamity, I could not stifle a cry of anguish, which Nature or Pandora heard with neither protest nor laughter; and, driven by some principle of cerebral disturbances, it was I who then set to laughing—a braying, idiotic laugh.",20,RO005TR06
1745,115,"“You’re right,” I said, “this all is amusing, and worth the while—monotonous, perhaps, but worth the while. When Job cursed the day he was conceived,2 it was only because he wanted to watch the spectacle from up here. Let’s go, Pandora, open up your maw3 and digest me; this all is amusing, but be done with it and digest me.”",20,RO005TR06
1746,116,"Her response was to force me to look downward and watch the swift and turbulent ages as they kept on passing by, generations overtaking generations, some sorrowful, like the Hebrews in captivity, others joyful, like the libertines under Commodus, and all arriving punctually at the grave. I wanted to flee, but a mysterious force held my feet; and so I said to myself: “Well, if the centuries are passing by, mine will arrive, and it will pass as well, and then the last of all will give me the key to the riddle of eternity.”",20,RO005TR06
1747,117,"And I fixed my gaze and continued to watch the ages as they came and went; now I was tranquil and resolute, if not even happy. Perhaps even happy. Each age bore its portion of shadow and light, of apathy and combat, of truth and error, with their processions of systems, new ideas, and new illusions; in each of them there burst forth the green of spring, which would yellow, only to bloom again.",20,RO005TR06
1748,118,"While life obeyed the regularity of a calendar, history and civilization were made, and man, naked and unarmed, armed and dressed himself, built huts and palaces, humble villages and Thebes of the hundred gates, created science, which scrutinizes, and art, which enraptures, became an orator, a mechanical, a philosopher, girdling the globe, descending to the bowels of the earth, and rising to the sphere of the clouds, thus contributing to the mysterious work with which he staved off the needs of life and the melancholy of abandonment.",20,RO005TR06
1749,119,"My eyes, wearied and distracted, at last beheld the present age, and the ages to come behind it. As it came, the former was agile, cunning, vibrant, and self-assured, a bit scattered, bold and learned, but in the end as miserable as the first, and so it passed like all the rest, with the same swiftness and like monotony. I redoubled my attention; I fixed my gaze; I would finally see the end—the end! But by then the speed of the procession was such that it escaped all comprehension; compared to it, a lightning bolt would last a century.",20,RO005TR06
1750,120,"Perhaps that was why things set to changing; some grew, others dwindled, others vanished into the air; a fog covered everything—except the hippopotamus that had brought me, and it, for that matter, began to shrink, shrink, and shrink, until it was the size of a cat. It was, in fact, a cat. I looked at it more closely; it was my cat Sultan, playing with a ball of paper by my bedroom door . . .",20,RO005TR06

1752,122,REASON VERSUS FOLLY,20,RO005TR06
1753,123,"My reader has no doubt understood that this was Reason, who had returned home and invited Folly to leave, crying out the words of Tartuffe, and with better reason than he:",20,RO005TR06
1754,124,"“La maison est à moi, c’est à vous d’en sortir.”1",20,RO005TR06
1755,125,"But Folly has an old habit of becoming accustomed to houses that are not her own; once she has made herself at home, it is no easy task to expel her. Force of habit; she won’t be removed; she grew hardened to shame long ago. Now, if we look to the immense number of houses that she occupies, some for good, others only during the summertime, we may conclude that this charming wanderer is the veritable bane of householders. In our case, there was nearly a scuffle at the door to my brain: the intruder refused to turn over the house, while the owner stood determined to take back what was hers. In the end, Folly declared she would settle for a corner of the attic.",20,RO005TR06
1756,126,"“No, madam,” countered Reason, “I am tired of surrendering attics to you, tired and tried. What you want is to creep from the attic to the dining room, and from there to the drawing room and the rest.”",20,RO005TR06
1757,127,"“All right, just let me stay a bit longer. I’m on the trail of a mystery . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1758,128,“What mystery?”,20,RO005TR06
1759,129,"“Two of them,” Folly corrected herself, “the mysteries of life and death. Just give me ten more minutes.”",20,RO005TR06
1760,130,Reason began to laugh.,20,RO005TR06
1761,131,“With you it’s always the same . . . always the same . . . always the same . . .”,20,RO005TR06
1762,132,"And so saying, she grabbed Folly by the wrists and dragged her outside; then she went in and locked the door. Folly whined a few pleas, snarled a few curses; but she soon resigned herself, stuck out her tongue, and went on her way . . .",20,RO005TR06

1764,134,TRANSITION,20,RO005TR06
1765,135,"Now, behold the dexterity and skill with which I shall carry out the most important transition in the book. To wit: my delirium began in the presence of Virgília; Virgília was the great sin of my youth; there can be no youth without childhood; childhood presupposes birth; and thus we have arrived, with no effort at all, at the 20th of October, 1805, the day of my birth. You see? No visible joints, nothing to upset the reader’s calm attention—not a thing.",20,RO005TR06
1766,136,"The book is given all the advantages of method without its inflexibility. And it was about time, for that matter. This business of a method, indispensable as it may be, works better sans cravat and sans suspenders, lightly and loosely dressed, taking no mind of the lady who lives across the street or the watchman on the block. It is like eloquence; there is the genuine, vibrant variety, with a natural, enchanting art, and another sort, which is stiff, pressed, and altogether hollow. Let us go to the 20th of October.",20,RO005TR06
1767,137,CHAPTER X,20,RO005TR06
1768,138,ON THAT DAY,20,RO005TR06
1769,139,"On that day, the tree of the Cubas family brought forth a fair flower. I was born; I was received in the arms of Pascoela, the illustrious midwife from Minho who boasted that she had opened the door to the world for a whole generation of noblemen. It’s certainly not impossible that my father might have heard this exclamation; I believe, nevertheless, that it was his fatherly feeling that drove him to gratify her with two half-dobras.1 Once washed and swaddled, I became at once the hero of our house. Each predicted my future as best fit his fancy. My uncle João, the old infantry officer, saw a Bonapartean look in me, an observation that made my father nauseated; but my uncle Ildefonso, then a simple priest, sniffed out a canon in me.",20,RO005TR06
1770,140,"“He’s to be a canon, and I won’t go any further so as to not seem prideful; but I shouldn’t wonder a bit if God has destined him for a bishopric . . . Yes, a bishopric; it’s not impossible. What say you, brother Bento?”",20,RO005TR06
1771,141,"My father replied to everyone that I would be whatever God willed; and he raised me up into the air, as if to show me to the city and the world; he asked everyone if I looked like him, if I was intelligent, handsome . . .",20,RO005TR06
1772,142,"I say these things rather in passing, as I heard them told years later; I was not privy to most of the particulars of that famous day. I do know that all the neighborhood came to greet the newborn, or sent compliments, and that during the first weeks our house was paid many visits. No sedan chair was left idle; many a frock coat and many fine breeches were aired out for the occasion. If I refrain from narrating the endearments, the kisses, the admiration, the blessings, it is because, should I do so, the chapter would never end, and end it must.",20,RO005TR06
1773,143,"Item, I can say nothing of my baptism, as nothing of it was related to me, except that it was one of the grandest celebrations of the following year, 1806; I was baptized in the church of São Domingos on a Tuesday in March, a clear day, bright and pure, my godparents being Colonel Rodrigues de Matos and his wife. Both descended from old Northern families and truly honored the blood that ran through their veins, blood spilled once upon a time in the war against the Dutch.2 I believe that their names were among the first things I learned; and I certainly reeled them off charmingly, or revealed some precocious talent in doing so, as I was unfailingly called upon to recite them for every visitor.",20,RO005TR06
1774,144,"“Young master, tell them your godfather’s name.”",20,RO005TR06
1775,145,"“My godfather? Why, he’s the Most Excellent Senhor Colonel Paulo Vaz Lobo César de Andrade e Sousa Rodrigues de Matos; my godmother is the Most Excellent Senhora Dona Maria Luísa de Macedo Resende e Sousa Rodrigues de Matos.”",20,RO005TR06
1776,146,“What a clever boy you have!” those listening would exclaim.,20,RO005TR06
1777,147,"“Very clever,” my father would agree; and his eyes would well up with pride, and he would lay a hand on my head and gaze on me at length, enamored, bursting with satisfaction.",20,RO005TR06
1778,148,"Item, I began to walk—I don’t know precisely when, but ahead of time. Perhaps to hasten nature along, I was forced to hang on to chairs, hoisted up by the diaper, given pushcarts.",20,RO005TR06
1779,149,"“That’s it, young master, on your own now,” my mother’s slave would say to me.",20,RO005TR06
1780,150,"And I, drawn to the tin rattle that my mother shook before me, would go on ahead, falling here and there; and I walked, probably not too well, but I walked, and so I kept on walking.",20,RO005TR06
1781,151,CHAPTER XI,20,RO005TR06
1782,152,THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN,20,RO005TR06
1783,153,"I grew up; this the family had no part in; I grew naturally, the way magnolias or cats do. Cats may be less shrewd, and magnolias are certainly less restless than I was as a child. A poet once said that the child is father of the man.1 If that is true, then let us observe a few of the features of the child.",20,RO005TR06
1784,154,"From age five I had earned the nickname “devil child,” and it was truly fitting; I was one of the wickedest of my time, cunning, bold, troublesome, and headstrong. For example, one day I broke the head of a slave because she had refused to give me a spoonful of the coconut sweet she was making, and, not content with the deed, I threw a handful of ashes in the pot, and, not satisfied with that mischief, I went and told my mother that the slave had ruined the sweet “out of spite”; and this at age six.",20,RO005TR06
1785,155,"Prudêncio, one of our slave boys, was the horse I rode around on; with his hands on the ground and a length of string between his teeth by way of a bit, I would climb astride his back with a little switch in hand, whipping him, riding up and down and around, and he would obey, moaning at times, but obeying without a word, or at most an “Ow, little master!” to which I would retort, “Shut your mouth, beast!”",20,RO005TR06
1786,156,"Hiding visitors’ hats, pinning paper tails on dignified people, pulling the pigtails of their wigs, pinching matrons’ arms, and many other feats of the same sort were signs of an unruly temperament, but I must be sure that they were also expressions of a robust spirit, as my father esteemed me greatly; if he ever reprehended me in the sight of others, it was out of pure formality: in private, he would cover me with kisses.",20,RO005TR06
1787,157,"One should not conclude that I spent the rest of my life breaking heads and hiding hats; but stubborn, selfish, and somewhat contemptuous of mankind, that I was; and while I didn’t pass my time hiding hats, I did pull a few wig-tails on occasion.",20,RO005TR06
1788,158,"Besides, I took a fancy to the contemplation of human injustice; I was inclined to minimize it, explain it away, classify it by parts, and understand it, not through a rigid model, but in keeping with each place and circumstance. My mother instructed me in her own fashion, having me memorize a few precepts and prayers; but I felt that I was governed less by prayers and more by my nerves and blood; and good rules lost their spirit, which is what gives them life, to become vain formulas. In the morning before my porridge, and at night before bed, I asked God to forgive me my debts, as I forgave my debtors; between morning and night I would work terrible mischief, and my father, once the tumult had died down, would pat me on the cheek and exclaim, laughing, “Ah, you rascal! Ah, you rascal!”",20,RO005TR06
1789,159,"Yes, my father did adore me.2 My mother was a weak woman, of little brains but great heart, exceedingly credulous, sincerely pious—homespun though pretty, and modest though wealthy, fearful of thunderclaps and of her husband. He was her god on earth. The collaboration of these two creatures produced my education, which, if possessed of certain virtues, was largely unsound, incomplete, and altogether negative on some scores. Now and then my uncle the canon would take his brother to task; he said that I was given more freedom than instruction, and more affection than correction; but my father replied that he was applying to my education a system wholly superior to the one in general use; and while failing to deceive his brother, he thus deluded himself.3",20,RO005TR06
1790,160,,20,RO005TR06
1791,161,"Along with my extraction and education was the example set by the rest of the domestic environment. We have seen my parents; let us turn to my uncles. One of them, João, was a man with a loose tongue, a merry life, and an endless supply of roguish conversation. From age eleven on I was granted admittance to the stories he told, some true, some not, but all shot through with obscenity or filth. He had no care for my youth, just as he had no care for his brother’s cassock; the difference was that the priest fled whenever he started in on some scabrous subject. I never did; I would let myself listen, understanding nothing at first, then understanding, and finally finding the fun in it. After a while, I was the one seeking him out; and he liked me very much, and would give me sweets and take me out with him.",20,RO005TR06
1792,162,"At home, when he happened to spend a few days with us, I found him more than a few times behind the house, in the laundry, chatting with the slave women as they beat at the clothes; then there would come a string of jokes, japes, questions, and bursts of laughter that nobody could hear, since the laundry was quite far from the house. The slave women, their dresses tucked into the tanga-cloths4 round their waists, some wading in the laundry tank, others outside it, leaning over the clothes as they beat, soaped, and wrung them, would take in and snap back at Uncle João’s witticisms, punctuating them now and again with the following exclamation:",20,RO005TR06
1793,163,“Lord help us! Massa João here is the devil himself!”,20,RO005TR06
1794,164,"My uncle the canon was altogether different. He was possessed of great austerity and purity; these gifts, however, rather than heightening the splendor of a superior spirit, only served to compensate for a mediocre one. He was not one to see the substance of the Church; he saw its exterior, the hierarchy, the preferments, the surplices, the genuflections. More a man of the sacristy than of the altar. A lapse in ritual offended him more grievously than a violation of the Commandments.",20,RO005TR06
1795,165,"Now, at a distance of so many years, I can’t say whether he might easily understand a passage from Tertullian or expound the history of the Nicene Creed without hesitation; but no one knew better than he the number and style of reverences due to the officiant at high mass.5 To be a canon was his only ambition in life; and he would say wholeheartedly that it was the highest honor to which a man could aspire. Pious, severe in his habits, a painstaking observer of rules, weak-willed, timorous, and subordinate, he possessed a few virtues, in which he was exemplary—but he was entirely lacking in the strength to impose them on or instill them in others.",20,RO005TR06
1796,166,"I shall say nothing of my maternal aunt, Dona Emerenciana, who was, as it happens, the person who held the greatest authority over me; this set her apart from the rest, but she lived only a short while in our company, two years or so. Other relatives and a few friends of the family fail to merit mention; we lived together only intermittently, with long spans of separation. What matters is a general view of the domestic sphere, which is hereby set out—vulgar characters, a love of hubbub and ostentatious appearances, a weakness of will, the unchallenged reign of whims and fancies, and all the rest. From that earth and that manure was this flower born.",20,RO005TR06

1798,168,AN EPISODE FROM 1814,20,RO005TR06
1799,169,"But I don’t wish to move on without summarily recounting a merry episode from 1814, when I was nine years old.",20,RO005TR06
1800,170,"At the time of my birth, Napoleon was reveling in the splendor of his glory and power; he was emperor and had utterly conquered the admiration of men.1 My father, who by dint of persuading others of our nobility had come to persuade himself, nursed a purely mental hatred of him. This was the cause of vicious squabbles in our house; my uncle João, whether out of an esprit de corps or professional sympathy, was given to pardoning in the despot what he admired in the general, while my uncle the priest stood inflexibly against the Corsican, and other relatives were divided; hence the controversies and quarrels.",20,RO005TR06
1801,171,"When the news arrived in Rio of Napoleon’s first fall,2 our house was naturally shaken, but there were no gibes or taunts. The defeated, in face of the public rejoicing, judged it more decorous to remain silent; some went so far as to join in the applause. The population was heartily pleased and did not stint on demonstrations of affection toward the royal family; the streets were lit, there were volleys of gunfire, a Te Deum, a procession, and acclamations.",20,RO005TR06
1802,172,"Around those days, I could be found sporting a new smallsword that my godfather had given me on St. Anthony’s Day; and, frankly, the sword interested me far more than Bonaparte’s fall. Never did I forget that phenomenon. Never did I cease to ponder that our smallsword always looms larger than Napoleon’s blade. And note that I heard many a speech when I was alive, I read many a sensational page of great ideas and greater words; but, I know not why, deep down behind the praise falling from my lips, there often echoed that voice of experience:",20,RO005TR06
1803,173,"“Come, now, all you care about is your smallsword.”",20,RO005TR06
1804,174,"My family, not content to have an anonymous part in the public rejoicing, found it both opportune and indispensable to celebrate the toppling of the emperor with a dinner, and such a dinner that the roar of the acclamations might reach the ears of His Highness, or at least those of his ministers. No sooner said than done. All the old silverware inherited from my grandfather Luís Cubas was brought down; out came the Flanders linens, the great jars from the Indies; a barrow pig was slaughtered; compotes and marmalades were ordered from the nuns of the Ajuda Convent; drawing rooms, staircases, candlesticks, sconces, the immense lamp chimneys, all the trappings of classical luxury were washed, scoured, and polished.",20,RO005TR06
1805,175,"The appointed hour was met by a select gathering: the king’s magistrate, three or four military officers, a few merchants and lawyers, several government officials, some with their wives and daughters, others without them, but all united by the desire to bury Bonaparte’s memory down a turkey’s gullet. This was not a dinner but a Te Deum; those were more or less the words of one of the lawyers present, Dr. Vilaça, the renowned improvisatore, who complemented the dishes put out by the house with the delicacies of the Muses.",20,RO005TR06
1806,176,"I remember, as if it were yesterday, I remember seeing him rise, his long-tailed wig, silk dress coat, an emerald on his finger, asking my priest uncle to repeat the theme, and, once it had been repeated, fixing his eyes for a moment on the forehead of a lady, and then coughing, raising his right hand—clenched but for the index finger, which pointed ceilingward—and, thus composed, delivering an improvisation on the theme. He glossed it not once, but three times; then he swore to his gods to never cease. He asked for a theme, was given it, and improvised on it straightaway, and soon asked for another and yet another; at length one of the ladies present was unable to stifle her great admiration.",20,RO005TR06
1807,177,"“You say that, madam,” Vilaça responded modestly, “because you never heard Bocage, as I did, at the end of the century, in Lisbon. Now, that was a sight! What ease! And what verses! We sparred for an hour, two hours, in Nicola’s Tavern, improvising amidst cheers and bravos.3 What an immense talent Bocage had! I heard precisely the same thing a few days ago from the Duchess of Cadaval . . .”4",20,RO005TR06
1808,178,"And these last three words, spoken with considerable emphasis, sent a quiver of admiration and astonishment through all assembled. This affable, artless man not only sparred with poets, but also discoursed with duchesses! A Bocage and a Cadaval! At coming into contact with such a man, the ladies felt themselves superbly refined; the men looked on him with respect, some with envy, not a few with incredulity. He, all the while, sailed along, piling adjective upon adjective, adverb upon adverb, running through all of the rhymes for tyrant and usurper. Dessert had come; nobody thought of eating.",20,RO005TR06
1809,179,"In between glosses, there came a cheerful murmur, the chatter of satisfied stomachs; languid and moist eyes, or lively and bright ones, sprawled out or darted up and down the table, which was crowded with sweets and fruits: here slices of pineapple, there cuts of melon, the glass serving dishes revealing the finely grated coconut sweet, gleaming yolk-yellow; farther along, the dark, thick molasses, not far from the cheese and the sweet yams.",20,RO005TR06
1810,180,"Now and then a jovial, hearty, unselfconscious laugh, the way one laughs when among family, would come to break through the political solemnity of the banquet. Alongside the grand common interest, smaller, personal matters stirred as well. The young ladies spoke of the songs they would sing at the harpsichord, of minuets and English solo dancing; and there was, of course, a matron who swore she’d dance a measure or two, just to show how she’d made merry in her girlhood.",20,RO005TR06
1811,181,"A fellow next to me was telling another the latest about the new blacks that were coming in, according to letters he’d received from Luanda, one letter in which his nephew reported he’d already acquired around forty, and another letter in which . . . He was carrying them right there in his pocket, but couldn’t read them out just yet. What he did hazard is that this journey alone would bring us some hundred and twenty blacks at the very least.",20,RO005TR06
1812,182,"Clap! Clap! Clap! Vilaça called the room to attention. The clamor ceased all at once, like an orchestra cutting off a note, and all eyes turned to the improvisatore. Those farther away cupped a hand behind an ear so as not to miss a word, and most, even before hearing the gloss, already had an easy, frank half-smile on their faces.",20,RO005TR06
1813,183,"As for me, there I was, lonely and unremembered, casting a wistful and loving eye on one of the compotes. At the end of each improvisation I brightened, hoping it was the last, but it never was, and the dessert remained untouched. Nobody thought to speak up. My father, at the head of the table, drank it all in deeply, savoring his guests’ joy; he saw himself reflected in the gleeful faces, the dishes, the flowers, delighting in the familiarity struck up between the most dissimilar souls under the sway of a fine dinner.",20,RO005TR06
1814,184,"I saw all this as I dragged my gaze from the compote to him, and from him to the compote, as if begging him to serve it to me; but I did so in vain. He saw nothing; he saw only himself. And the improvisations came one after the other, washing over me in torrents, forcing me to check my desire and my pleas. I bore it as long as I could; and that wasn’t long. First I asked for the sweet quietly; then finally I bellowed, bawled, and stamped my feet. My father, who would give me the sun if I asked for it, called a slave over to serve me the dessert; but it was too late. Aunt Emerenciana had wrenched me from my chair and turned me over to a slave girl, despite my shouting and thrashing.",20,RO005TR06
1815,185,"Such was the improvisatore’s crime: he had delayed the compote and caused my banishment. This was enough for me to plot vengeance; and it had to be grand and exemplary, something that would make him look ridiculous. After all, he was a dignified man, Dr. Vilaça, measured and sedate, forty-seven years old, married and with children. I wouldn’t be satisfied with a paper tail or a yanked wig; I needed something worse. I spent the rest of the afternoon watching him, then following him around the grounds as the guests embarked on a postprandial stroll. I saw him talking with Dona Eusébia, the sister of Sergeant-Major Domingues, a robust spinster, who, though not pretty, was hardly homely.",20,RO005TR06

1817,187,“Why?”,20,RO005TR06

1819,189,They had ducked into a small thicket; it was twilight; I followed them in. Vilaça’s eyes glimmered with the sparks of wine and the weakness of the flesh.,20,RO005TR06

1822,192,"Dona Eusébia dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief. The improvisatore scoured his memory for some scrap of literature and came up with this, which I later found to be from one of Judeu’s operas.",20,RO005TR06

1825,195,"“Dr. Vilaça kissed Dona Eusébia!” I bellowed, running out across the grounds.",20,RO005TR06
1826,196,"My words were like a thunderclap; everyone froze in stupefaction; eyes cast here and there; furtive smiles and secrets were exchanged as mothers carried off their daughters, claiming that they might catch cold. My father was truly vexed by my indiscretion and made a show of boxing my ears; but the next day at breakfast, as he recalled the incident, he simply tweaked my nose and laughed:",20,RO005TR06

1830,200,"Let us put our feet together and take a flying leap over the school, that tedious school, where I learned to read, write, count, deliver punches and take them, and to make mischief in the hills or on the beaches, wherever proved more inviting to the idle.",20,RO005TR06
1831,201,"That time had its torments, it’s true; there were the reprimands, the punishments, and the arduous, interminable lessons, but scant more: very little and very light at that. Only the paddlings came down hard, and even so . . . O paddle, terror of my boyhood, you were the compelle intrare1 with which an old schoolmaster, a bald and bony man, impressed into my brain the alphabet, prosody, syntax, and whatever else he knew. Blessed paddle, so heartily cursed in the modern age, if I could have only remained under your yoke, with my callow soul, my ignorance, and my smallsword, that little sword from 1814, so superior to Napoleon’s!",20,RO005TR06
1832,202,"What was it that you wanted, after all, teacher of my first letters? Lessons learned by heart and good behavior in class; nothing more, nothing less, than is demanded of us by life itself, which teaches us our last letters; the difference being that while you did make me fear you, you never made me angry. Even now I can see you enter the classroom in your cloak and white-leather slippers, handkerchief in hand, bald pate shining, chin clean-shaven; I see you sit down, sigh, grunt, take a first pinch of snuff, and then begin the lesson. And so you did for twenty-three years, quiet, unsung, and punctual, tucked away in a little house on the Rua do Piolho,2 never troubling the world with your mediocrity, until one day you took that great leap into the darkness, and no one wept for you, save one old negro—no one, not even I, who owe you the rudiments of writing.",20,RO005TR06
1833,203,"The schoolmaster’s name was Ludgero. I want to write out his whole name on this page: it was Ludgero Barata, which means cockroach, an unfortunate surname that was the eternal butt of the boys’ jokes. One of us, Quincas Borba, was downright cruel to the poor man. Two or three times a week, he would leave a dead cockroach in the pocket of the schoolmaster’s trousers—which were conveniently loose-fitting—or in the desk drawer, or next to the inkwell. If the schoolmaster came across it during class, he would start, turn a pair of flaming eyes on us, and call us the worst names he could muster: we were vermin, scoundrels, blackguards, urchins. Some trembled, while others muttered; Quincas Borba, however, kept quiet, his eyes fixed on nothing in particular.",20,RO005TR06
1834,204,"A flower, Quincas Borba. Never in my childhood, never in all my life, did I find such a charming, inventive, mischievous boy. He was the flower not only of the school, but also of all the city. His mother, a widow of some means, adored her son and kept him pampered, neat, and prettily adorned, with a handsomely dressed servant boy who let us shirk school, go off and hunt for birds’ nests, run after lizards on Livramento or Conceição Hill, or simply roam at our leisure like two idle dandies. And as an emperor!",20,RO005TR06
1835,205,"It was a delight to see Quincas Borba play the emperor at the feast of the Holy Spirit. In our childish games, for that matter, he would always choose the part of king, minister, general, whatever might place him above the rest. He had a grace about him, that troublemaker, and a grave air, with something magnificent in his attitudes and gestures. Who would have thought that . . . Halt the pen there, lest we reveal coming events. Let us leap ahead to 1822, the date of our political independence and of my own first captivity.",20,RO005TR06

1837,207,THE FIRST KISS,20,RO005TR06
1838,208,"I was seventeen; my lip was afflicted with down that I was making every endeavor to coax into a moustache. My eyes, lively and resolute, were my only truly masculine feature. As I exuded a certain arrogance, it was difficult to discern whether I was a child putting on manly airs or a man with the look of a boy. On the whole, I was a handsome lad, handsome and daring, striding into life in boots and spurs, whip in hand and blood in my veins, atop a sinewy, swift charger in fine fettle, like the charger from the old ballads that the Romantics went looking for in medieval castles, only to light upon it along the streets of our century. The worst is that they overworked the poor beast so terribly that it had to be left by the side of the road; the Realists found it there, leprous and worm-eaten, and, out of compassion, took the animal into their books.",20,RO005TR06
1839,209,"Yes, I was that handsome, graceful, wealthy lad; and one may easily imagine that more than one lady inclined a pensive brow in my direction, or raised a pair of covetous eyes to meet mine. But of all of them, the one who captivated me straightaway was a . . . a . . . I’m not sure I should say; this book is chaste, at least in its intentions; in its intentions it is supremely chaste. But let’s have at it, and say all or nothing. My capturer was a Spanish lady, Marcela, “lovely Marcela,” as the young men of the day called her. And they were right.",20,RO005TR06
1840,210,"She was the daughter of a gardener from Asturias; she told me so herself, on a sincere day, because the accepted version had it that she was born to a lawyer from Madrid, a victim of the French invasion who was wounded, imprisoned, and shot when she was just twelve years old. Cosas de España. Whoever he might have been, her father, lawyer or gardener, the truth is that Marcela lacked any rustic innocence, and barely understood the morality of the law at that. She was pretty, agreeable, sans scruples, and somewhat hampered by the austerity of the time, which kept her from parading her fancies and fine carriages down the streets; luxurious, impatient, fond of money and of young men. That year, she was fairly dying for love of a certain Xavier, a wealthy fellow, and consumptive to boot—a gem.",20,RO005TR06
1841,211,"I saw her for the first time at the Rossio Grande, on the night the houses were all lit just after the declaration of independence; a festival of spring, the dawning of the public soul. We were two youths, the nation’s people and I; we were scarce out of childhood, with all the ardor of adolescence. I saw her emerge from a sedan chair, graceful and gaudy, her body slender and undulating, bold in a way I’d never seen in chaste women. “Follow me,” she said to her servant. And I followed her, just as much a servant as he, as if the order had been directed at me; I let myself go, enamored, quivering, brimming over with the dawn of life. Along the way, someone called her “lovely Marcela,” reminding me that I’d heard that name from my uncle João, and, I’ll confess it, I was left giddy.",20,RO005TR06
1842,212,"Three days later, my uncle asked me in secret whether I would like to go to a supper in Cajueiros, where “young ladies” would be in attendance. We went; it was at Marcela’s house. Xavier, though consumed by his consumption, presided over the nocturnal banquet. I ate little or nothing, as I had eyes only for the hostess. How charming the Spanish girl was! There were another half-dozen ladies—all of the night—and they were pretty, enchanting in their own right, but next to the Spaniard . . . Enthusiasm, a few swallows of wine, and my imperious, rash temperament all led me to do one single thing; as we were leaving, at the door to the street, I told my uncle to wait a moment and went up the stairs again.",20,RO005TR06
1843,213,"“Did you forget something?” Marcela asked, standing at the head of the stairs.",20,RO005TR06
1844,214,“My handkerchief.”,20,RO005TR06
1845,215,"She moved to let me through to the drawing room; I took her hands, pulled her toward me, and gave her a kiss. I don’t know whether she said anything at all, if she shouted, if she called out to anyone; I know nothing; I know only that I went down the stairs again, swift as a whirlwind and unsteady as a drunk.",20,RO005TR06

1847,217,MARCELA,20,RO005TR06
1848,218,"It took me thirty days to get from the Rossio Grande to Marcela’s heart, no longer astride the charger of blind desire, but riding the wily, stubborn ass of patience. There are, in truth, two methods for winning over a woman: through violence, as with Europa and the bull, or through insinuation, as with Leda and the swan and Danae and the shower of gold: three of Father Zeus’s inventions, which, having fallen out of fashion, are replaced here by the horse and the ass. I’ll not speak of the plots I devised, nor of the bribes, nor the alternating of confidence and fear, nor the waiting in vain, nor any of these other preliminaries. I will declare to you that the ass was worthy of the charger—a Sancho Panza of an ass, a true philosopher, who led me to her house at the end of the period in question; I dismounted, gave it a slap on the flank, and sent it off to graze.",20,RO005TR06
1849,219,"First frenzy of my youth, how sweet you seemed! At the Creation, such must have been the effect of the first sunlight. Imagine for yourself the effect of that first sunlight, beating down on the face of a fresh-formed world. Well, this was the same thing, friend reader, and if you were ever eighteen, you must remember that it was just like that.",20,RO005TR06
1850,220,"There were two phases to our passion, or our liaison, or whatever name you wish to call it by, for I take no mind of names; there was the consular phase and the imperial phase. During the first, which was short-lived, Xavier and I reigned together, though he never knew that he was sharing the government of Rome with me; but when credulity could no longer withstand evidence, Xavier laid down his insignia and I held all power in my hands; this was the Caesarean phase. The universe was mine; but, alas! it didn’t come free of charge. I had to scrape together money, multiply it, and then invent it.",20,RO005TR06
1851,221,"First I tested my father’s largesse; he would give me everything I asked without rebuke, without delay, without a cold word; he would tell everyone that I was a young man, and he too had been one. But it reached such extremes that he came to restrict his liberality somewhat, and then more, then still more. Then I turned to my mother and persuaded her to lay aside some of her household allowance, which she gave me in secret. It was too little; and I took to a last resort: I began taking credit on the inheritance I expected from my father, signing promissory notes to be paid off with interest.",20,RO005TR06
1852,222,"“Really,” Marcela would say to me when I brought her some jewel or some silks, “I do believe you want us to quarrel . . . This just isn’t right . . . such an expensive gift . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1853,223,"And if it was a piece of jewelry, she would say this as she contemplated it between her fingers, holding it up to the light, trying it on, and laughing, and kissing me again and again, impetuous and sincere; even as she protested, her happiness poured forth from her eyes, and I felt happy to see her so. She took a liking to old dobras, and I brought her as many of the gold coins as I could come by; Marcela collected them all in a little iron coffer, and no one knew where she kept the key; she hid it for fear of the slaves.",20,RO005TR06
1854,224,"The house where she lived in Cajueiros was her own. The furniture, of carved jacaranda wood, was sturdy and well made, as were all the other effects, mirrors, vases, and the crockery—a beautiful set from the East India Company, which had been given to her by a judge. Accursed crockery, you dealt my nerves many a blow. I said so to the owner of the crockery many a time; I never disguised how these and other spoils of her past loves exasperated me.",20,RO005TR06
1855,225,"She would listen to me and laugh, with a frank expression—it was frank and something else, which I didn’t quite understand at the time; now, as I think back on it, I believe it was a hybrid smile, such as might come from the creature born of, say, one of Shakespeare’s witches and one of Klopstock’s seraphim. I may not be making myself clear. Precisely because she had taken note of my belated jealousy, she seemed to like to spur it on. So it was that one day, when I was unable to give her a necklace she’d seen in a jeweler’s, she retorted that it was just a joke and that our love needed no such vulgar inducements.",20,RO005TR06
1856,226,,20,RO005TR06
1857,227,"“I’ll never forgive you if you get such wretched ideas of me,” she concluded, threatening me with a finger.",20,RO005TR06
1858,228,"And then, as quickly as a little bird, she put out her hands, clasped my face in them, drew me to her, and pulled a charming, childish face. Then, leaning back on her divan, she went on simply and straightforwardly, saying that she would never let her affections be bought. She had often sold her appearances, but reserved her inner self for a scant few. Duarte, for example, the sub-lieutenant, whom she had truly loved two years before, could only rarely manage to give her something of value, as I could; she would unreservedly accept only meagerly priced gifts, such as the gold cross he had once given her on a feast day.",20,RO005TR06
1859,229,“This cross . . .”,20,RO005TR06
1860,230,"As she said this, she put her hand to her breast and held up a delicate gold cross, held round her neck by a blue ribbon.",20,RO005TR06
1861,231,"“But that cross,” I observed, “didn’t you say it was your father . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1862,232,Marcela wagged her head with an air of pity.,20,RO005TR06
1863,233,"“Didn’t you see that it was a lie, that I told you so as not to upset you? Come now, chiquito, don’t mistrust me so . . . I loved another; what does it matter, if it’s passed? One day, when we part . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1864,234,“Don’t say that!” I cried.,20,RO005TR06
1865,235,“Everything comes to an end! One day . . .”,20,RO005TR06
1866,236,"She couldn’t finish; a sob choked her voice; she stretched out her hands, took mine, nestled me to her breast, and whispered in my ear:",20,RO005TR06
1867,237,"“Never, never, my love!”",20,RO005TR06
1868,238,I thanked her with damp eyes. The next day I brought her the necklace she had rejected.,20,RO005TR06
1869,239,"“For you to remember me by when we part,” I said.",20,RO005TR06
1870,240,"Marcela at first responded with an indignant silence; then she made a magnificent gesture, and moved to throw the necklace out the window. I caught her arm and begged her not to affront me so, begged her to keep the gift. She smiled and kept it.",20,RO005TR06
1871,241,"Meanwhile, she paid me amply for my sacrifices; she guessed at my most furtive thoughts; there was no desire that she did not hasten to fulfill, sincerely and simply, obeying a sort of law of conscience and the necessities of the heart. These were never reasonable desires, but pure childish willfulness, a fancy to see her dressed a certain way, with such and such adornments, in this dress and not that one, to go on outings, or something of that sort, and she gave in to everything, smiling and chattering.",20,RO005TR06
1872,242,"“You’re an Arabian-night sort of fellow,”1 she’d say.",20,RO005TR06

1875,245,AN IMMORAL REFLECTION,20,RO005TR06
1876,246,"I’m struck by an immoral reflection, which is also a rectification of my style. I believe I said in Chapter XIV that Marcela was dying of love for Xavier. She wasn’t dying, she was living. Living is not the same thing as dying; all the jewelers in the world will tell you that, and they are quite well versed in grammar. Good jewelers, what would be left of love were you not there to offer up baubles and credit? A third, perhaps a fifth, of the universal trade in hearts.",20,RO005TR06
1877,247,"This is the immoral reflection I had planned on making, which is even more obscure than it is immoral, because what I mean to say is not entirely clear. What I mean to say is that the loveliest brow in the world is left no less lovely when girded with a diadem of precious stones; no less lovely, no less beloved. Marcela, for example, who was quite beautiful, Marcela loved me . . .",20,RO005TR06

1879,249,CONCERNING THE TRAPEZE AND OTHER MATTERS,20,RO005TR06
1880,250,". . . Marcela loved me for fifteen months and eleven thousand milréis;1 nothing less. My father, once he got wind of the eleven thousand milréis, was truly alarmed; he felt that the matter had overstepped the bounds of youthful caprice.",20,RO005TR06
1881,251,"“This time,” he said, “you’ll go to Europe; you’ll study at a university, most likely Coimbra; I want you to be a serious man, not a gadabout and a thief.”",20,RO005TR06
1882,252,And when I looked astonished:,20,RO005TR06
1883,253,"“A thief, yes, sir, there’s no other word for a son who does what you’ve done . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1884,254,"He produced from a pocket my promissory notes, which he had already paid off, and shook them in my face.",20,RO005TR06
1885,255,"“See this, you dandy? Is this how a young man should care for the family name? Do you think my grandfathers and I earned our money in gambling houses or roaming the streets? You miserable beggar! This time you’ll come to your senses or you’ll be left with nothing.”",20,RO005TR06
1886,256,"He was furious, but his fury was tempered and brief. I listened to him in silence and mounted no objections to the journey, as I had on other occasions; I was mulling over the idea of taking Marcela with me. I went to see her, laid out the crisis, and put the proposal to her. Marcela listened to me blankly, without responding right away; when I insisted, she said that she would stay, that she couldn’t go to Europe.",20,RO005TR06
1887,257,“Why not?”,20,RO005TR06
1888,258,"“I can’t,” she said with a mournful look, “I simply can’t breathe that air while I’m still haunted by the memory of my poor father, slain by Napoleon . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1889,259,"“Which one of them, the gardener or the lawyer?”",20,RO005TR06
1890,260,"Marcela furrowed her brow and hummed a seguidilla through her teeth; then she complained of the heat and called for a cup of aluá. The slave brought it over on a silver tray, which was part of my eleven thousand milréis. Marcela politely offered me the sweet wine; my response was to slap the cup and the tray, whereupon the liquid spilled into her lap, the negress shrieked, and I bellowed at her to get out. Once we were alone, I poured out all the despair in my heart; I said she was a monster, that she’d never loved me, that she’d brought me this low without even the excuse of sincerity; I called her many an ugly name, to which I added wild gesticulation.",20,RO005TR06
1891,261,"Marcela let herself sit there, tapping a nail on her teeth, cold as a slab of marble. I felt the impulse to strangle her, or at least to humiliate her and see her grovel at my feet. I might have done so; but somehow the act become another; it was I who threw myself at her feet, contrite and beseeching; I kissed them, recalled the months of our private happiness, repeated the sweet names of old, sitting on the floor with my head between her knees, pressing her hands in mine; breathless, beside myself, I pled tearfully that she not forsake me . . . Marcela gazed at me for a moment or two, both of us silent, until she lightly turned me aside and said, with a weary air:",20,RO005TR06

1893,263,"She rose, shook out her wet dress, and walked into her bedchamber.",20,RO005TR06
1894,264,“No!” I bellowed. “You mustn’t go . . . I won’t have it . . .”,20,RO005TR06
1895,265,I was ready to fall on her; it came too late; she had gone in and closed the door.,20,RO005TR06
1896,266,"I went out, beside myself; I spent two deadly hours wandering round the most far-flung and deserted neighborhoods, where I wouldn’t easily be found. I gnawed at my despair with a sort of morbid gluttony; I evoked every day, hour, and instant of rapture, first heartening myself with the thought that they were eternal and that all this was nothing more than a nightmare, and then deceiving myself, trying to shrug them off as a useless burden.",20,RO005TR06
1897,267,"Then I would resolve to set off at once, to cleave my life in two, and I delighted in the idea that Marcela would be consumed with longing and remorse when she heard of my departure. After all, she had loved me madly, so she must feel something, be left with some memory, like that of the sub-lieutenant . . . At that, jealousy buried a barb in my heart; my whole nature bellowed that I had to take Marcela with me.",20,RO005TR06
1898,268,"“I must . . . I must . . .” I repeated, wounding the air with a blow.",20,RO005TR06
1899,269,"At last, I had a providential idea . . . Ah! Trapeze of my sins, trapeze of all my abstruse conceptions! The providential idea swung from it like the idea of the plaster (Chapter II). It was simply to enthrall her, enthrall her beyond measure, dazzle her, sweep her away; and it occurred to me to use a method more concrete than supplication. I didn’t consider the consequences; I took out one last loan, went to the Rua dos Ourives, bought the finest piece of jewelry in the city, three large diamonds set in an ivory comb; and I ran to Marcela’s house.",20,RO005TR06

1902,272,"And I showed her the comb with the diamonds . . . Marcela started slightly, raised up halfway,2 and, leaning on an elbow, gazed at the comb for a few brief moments; then she turned her gaze away; she had mastered herself. Then I laid hands on her hair, heaped it up, hastily arranged it into an impromptu coiffure, a crooked one at that, and finished it off with the diamond comb; I leaned back, drew close again, correcting a few stray tresses, evening out one side, searching for some symmetry in the disorder before me, all with the painstaking affection of a mother.",20,RO005TR06
1903,273,"“There we are,” I said.",20,RO005TR06
1904,274,“Silly!” was her first reply.,20,RO005TR06
1905,275,"Her second was to pull me to her and pay me for my sacrifice with a kiss, the most ardent yet. Then she took out the comb and admired the material and the workmanship at length, looking at me from time to time and wagging her head as if to rebuke me:",20,RO005TR06

1909,279,“I’ll go. When do you set off?”,20,RO005TR06
1910,280,“In two or three days.”,20,RO005TR06
1911,281,“I’ll go.”,20,RO005TR06

1915,285,"At the foot of the stairs, at the end of the dark hallway, I stopped for a few moments to breathe, come to myself, call my scattered thoughts to order, compose myself after so many profound and contrary sentiments. I found that I was happy. The diamonds tainted that happiness somewhat, it’s true; but it is no less true that a pretty woman may well love both the Greeks and their presents. And I trusted my sweet Marcela; she might have flaws, but she loved me . . .",20,RO005TR06

1917,287,"And there, as if to mock me, I saw Marcela’s gaze, that gaze that had just given me a shadow of mistrust, eyes sparkling above a nose that was at once Bakbarah’s nose and my own. Poor lover of the Thousand and One Nights!1 I saw you right there, running after the vizier’s wife, along the gallery, she waving to you with the promise of her hand, and you running, running, running, down the long passage, whereupon you emerged onto the street and all the curriers jeered at you and beat you.",20,RO005TR06
1918,288,"Then it seemed to me that Marcela’s hallway was the passage, and that the street was the street in Baghdad. Indeed, as I looked at the door, I saw three of the curriers there, one in a cassock, one in livery, and one in civilian dress, upon which all three came into the hallway, took me by the arms, and marched me into a coach, my father on the right, my uncle the priest on the left, and the one in livery at the head of the coach, whereupon they took me to the house of the police intendant and from there to a ship bound for Lisbon. You may imagine the resistance I mounted; but all resistance was useless.",20,RO005TR06
1919,289,"Three days later I left the harbor behind, disheartened and speechless. I didn’t even cry; I had a fixed idea . . . Damn those fixed ideas! Just then, all I could think to do was plunge into the ocean, repeating Marcela’s name.",20,RO005TR06
1920,290,CHAPTER XIX,20,RO005TR06
1921,291,ON BOARD,20,RO005TR06
1922,292,"We were eleven passengers: a madman accompanied by his wife, two young men out on a trip, four merchants, and two servants. My father entrusted me to all of them, starting with the ship’s captain, who had plenty on his hands already; in addition to everything else, he was traveling with his deathly consumptive wife.",20,RO005TR06
1923,293,"I don’t know whether the captain suspected something of my macabre plans, or whether my father had warned him; I know that he never took his eyes off me, and called me after him wherever he went. When he couldn’t be with me, he took me to see his wife. She was nearly always in a low bed, coughing constantly and promising to show me the countryside around Lisbon. She wasn’t thin, she was transparent; it seemed impossible that she wouldn’t die from one hour to the next. The captain pretended not to believe in her impending death, perhaps attempting to deceive himself. I knew nothing and I thought nothing. What did it matter to me what befell a consumptive woman in the middle of the ocean? The world, for me, was Marcela.",20,RO005TR06
1924,294,"One night after a week had passed, I found a promising opportunity to die. I went cautiously up on deck, but there I found the captain, his eyes fixed on the horizon.",20,RO005TR06
1925,295,“A storm?” I asked.,20,RO005TR06
1926,296,"“No,” he said with a shudder, “no, I’m admiring the splendor of the night. Look; it’s simply celestial!”",20,RO005TR06
1927,297,"The style was at odds with the man, a rather rustic type who would have seemed unacquainted with refined turns of phrase. I turned to look at him; he seemed to savor my astonishment. After a few seconds, he took me by the hand and pointed at the moon, asking me why I didn’t compose an ode to the night; I responded that I was no poet. The captain muttered something, took two steps, stuck a hand in his pocket, and took out a heavily creased piece of paper; then, by the light of a lantern, he read a Horatian ode about the freedom of maritime life. He had written it himself.",20,RO005TR06
1928,298,“What d’you say?”,20,RO005TR06
1929,299,I can’t recall what I said; I do recall that he shook my hand with great vigor and many thanks; soon thereafter he recited two sonnets and was about to recite another when word came that his wife wanted him.,20,RO005TR06
1930,300,"“I’ll be right there,” he said, and recited the third sonnet to me, lingeringly and lovingly.",20,RO005TR06
1931,301,"I was left alone; but the captain’s muse had swept the evil thoughts from my spirit; I preferred to sleep, which is a provisional form of dying. We awoke the next day amidst a terrible storm that frightened us all, except the madman, who began leaping around and saying that his daughter was coming to fetch him in a fine carriage; the death of his daughter had been the cause of his madness. No, I shall never forget the dreadful vision of that poor man, amidst the din of the passengers and the howls of the hurricane, singing and dancing with his eyes starting out of his head, his face pale, his hair unkempt and long.",20,RO005TR06
1932,302,"At times he would stop, raise his bony hands, and make crosses with his fingers, then crisscrosses, then rings, as he laughed long and desperately. His wife could no longer care for him; given over to her terror of death, she prayed for her own salvation to all the saints in heaven. At last the tempest relented. I confess that it was an excellent diversion from the tempest in my heart. I, who had pondered seeking out death, didn’t dare meet its gaze when it sought me out.",20,RO005TR06
1933,303,"The captain wanted to know if I’d been afraid, if I’d been in any danger, if I hadn’t found the spectacle sublime, all this with friendly interest. The conversation naturally turned to life at sea; the captain asked me if I liked piscatorial idylls, to which I responded innocently that I didn’t know what they were.",20,RO005TR06
1934,304,"“You’ll see,” he responded.",20,RO005TR06
1935,305,"And he recited a little poem to me, then another—an eclogue1—and then finally five sonnets, with which he finished off his literary confidences for the day. On the following day, before reciting anything, the captain explained to me that he had taken to the maritime profession only for compelling reasons; his grandmother had wanted him for the priesthood, and he had some Latin; he never came to be a priest, but he never ceased to be a poet, which was his natural vocation.",20,RO005TR06
1936,306,"To prove it, he recited some hundred verses right then and there. I observed a phenomenon: his gesticulation was such that on one occasion I laughed; but it so happened that as the captain recited, he turned his gaze so far inward that he neither saw nor heard anything.",20,RO005TR06
1937,307,"The days passed away, and the waters, and the verses, and with them the life of the captain’s wife. She was near the end. One day, just after lunch, the captain said to me that she might not see the end of the week.",20,RO005TR06
1938,308,“So soon!” I exclaimed.,20,RO005TR06
1939,309,“She had a very bad night.”,20,RO005TR06
1940,310,"I went to see her; to my eyes she was on the brink of the grave, but still going on about resting in Lisbon for a few days before going with me to Coimbra, as she planned to accompany me to the University. I left her side, distraught; I found her husband watching the waves break and die against the ship, and tried to console him; he thanked me, recounted the story of their love, praised his wife’s fidelity and dedication, recalled the verses he’d written for her, and recited them to me. At this point he was called to her side; we both ran to her; she was in the throes of a fit. This and the next day were cruel; the third day brought her death; I fled from the spectacle, finding it repugnant. Half an hour later I found the captain sitting on a coil of rope, his head in his hands; I gave him a word of comfort.",20,RO005TR06
1941,311,"“She died like a saint,” he replied; and, lest these words be ascribed to weakness, he straightened up at once, shook his head, and fixed his gaze long and deeply on the horizon. “Now,” he went on, “let us deliver her to the grave that is never to be opened.”",20,RO005TR06
1942,312,"Indeed, a few hours later, the cadaver was cast into the sea with the customary ceremony. Sadness had withered every face; the widower’s bore the expression of a mountaintop cleaved by a lightning bolt. A great silence. The wave opened its maw, received the remains, closed once more—a slight wrinkle—and the ship moved on. I let myself remain there for a few minutes, at the stern, my eyes resting on that unknown point of the sea where one of us had been left . . . From there I sought out the captain, looking to distract him.",20,RO005TR06
1943,313,"“Thank you,” he said, understanding my intent; “you may be sure that I will never forget your kindness. God bless you for it. Poor Leocádia! You’ll think of us in heaven.”",20,RO005TR06
1944,314,"He wiped a troublesome tear away with his sleeve; I cast around for a diversion in poetry, his passion. I spoke to him of the verses he’d read to me and offered to have them printed. The captain’s eyes livened a bit.",20,RO005TR06
1945,315,"“I might accept,” he said, “but then again, the verses are quite weak.”",20,RO005TR06
1946,316,I swore to him that they weren’t; I asked him to gather them together and give them to me before we docked.,20,RO005TR06
1947,317,“Poor Leocádia!” he murmured without responding to my request. “A cadaver . . . the sea . . . the sky . . . the ship . . .”,20,RO005TR06
1948,318,"The next day he read me a freshly composed dirge recalling the circumstances of his wife’s death and burial; as he read, his voice was truly moved, his hands trembling; at the end he asked me if the verses were worthy of the treasure he had lost.",20,RO005TR06
1949,319,"“They are,” I said.",20,RO005TR06
1950,320,"“They may not be inspired,” he pondered after a moment, “but no one will deny me their feeling—if the feeling itself hasn’t compromised their perfection, that is . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1951,321,“I wouldn’t say so; the verses are perfect.”,20,RO005TR06
1952,322,"“Yes, well . . . The verses of a seaman.”",20,RO005TR06
1953,323,“Of a seaman and a poet.”,20,RO005TR06
1954,324,"He shrugged, looked at the paper, and recited the composition again, but this time with no tremors at all, accentuating the literary flourishes, underscoring the images and the melody of the verses. At the end, he confessed that it was his best-wrought work yet; I agreed; he shook my hand and predicted a great future for me.",20,RO005TR06
1955,325,CHAPTER XX,20,RO005TR06
1956,326,I TAKE MY DEGREE,20,RO005TR06
1957,327,"A great future! As the words echoed in my ears, I returned my eyes to that mysterious, uncertain horizon off in the distance. One idea drove out another, and ambition unseated Marcela. A great future? Perhaps a naturalist, a man of letters, an archaeologist, a banker, a politician, or even a bishop—even that would do—as long as it meant rank, preeminence, a great reputation, a superior position. If ambition were an eagle, just then it had pecked through its shell and unveiled a tawny, penetrating eye. Farewell, loves! Farewell, Marcela! Days of delirium, jewels without price, life without order, farewell! Here go I on to toil and glory; I leave you with my knee breeches.",20,RO005TR06
1958,328,"And it was thus that I disembarked in Lisbon and headed for Coimbra. The University awaited me with its arduous subjects; I studied them in quite a mediocre fashion, but not even that deprived me of my law degree; it was awarded with the customary solemnity, after the stipulated number of years, in a fine celebration that filled me with pride and wistfulness—mostly wistfulness. In Coimbra I had made quite a name for myself as a merrymaker; I was a wastrel, a superficial, troublemaking, and petulant student, given to adventures, following romanticism in practice and liberalism in theory, living with a pure faith in dark eyes and written constitutions.",20,RO005TR06
1959,329,"On the day the University certified on sheepskin that I had acquired knowledge that was, in truth, far from rooted in my brain, I confess that I found myself to some extent cheated, albeit proud. Let me explain: the diploma was a letter of emancipation; while it gave me freedom, it also gave me responsibility. I stowed it away, left the banks of the Mondego, and headed off, rather crestfallen, but already feeling an urge, a curiosity, a desire to rub elbows, to influence, to enjoy, to live—to prolong the University throughout my life . . .",20,RO005TR06
1960,330,CHAPTER XXI,20,RO005TR06
1961,331,THE MULETEER,20,RO005TR06
1962,332,"And just then, the donkey I was riding on balked; I whipped it, and it bucked twice, then thrice, then once again, this last time throwing me from the saddle, but at such an unfortunate angle that my left foot remained caught in the stirrup; I tried to hang on to the animal’s belly, but it, now frightened, set off flying down the road. Rather, I should say: it tried to set off, and indeed took a couple of bounds, but a muleteer who happened to be nearby rushed over in time to seize the reins and detain the donkey, not without considerable effort and danger to himself. With the brute subdued, I disentangled myself from the stirrup and righted myself.",20,RO005TR06
1963,333,"“Just look what an escape you had, sir,” said the muleteer.",20,RO005TR06
1964,334,"And it was true; if the donkey had run off, I would have been gravely injured, and death might await me at the end of my calamity; a split head, a congestion, any sort of disturbance within, and that would be the end of all my blossoming knowledge. The muleteer might well have saved my life; that seemed certain; I felt it in the blood surging through my heart. Blessed muleteer! As I gathered myself, he took to fixing the donkey’s harness, carefully and skillfully. I resolved to give him three gold coins of the five I had with me; not because this was the price of my life—which was beyond measure—but because it was a reward worthy of the selflessness with which he had saved me. It’s settled; I’ll give him the three coins.",20,RO005TR06
1965,335,"“There you are,” he said, handing me the reins.",20,RO005TR06
1966,336,"“Just a moment,” I replied. “Let me be, I’m not myself yet . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1967,337,“Bah!”,20,RO005TR06
1968,338,"“Well, wasn’t I nearly killed?”",20,RO005TR06
1969,339,"“If the donkey’d run off, p’rhaps; but with the Lord’s help, sir, none of that came to pass.”",20,RO005TR06
1970,340,"I went to the saddlebags and took out the old waistcoat with the five gold coins in the pocket; and during that time I pondered whether the payment wasn’t excessive, and if two coins wouldn’t do. Perhaps one. Indeed, one coin would suffice to make him quake with joy. I examined his clothing; he was a poor devil who’d never seen a gold coin in his life. One coin, then. I took it out and saw it shine in the sunlight; the muleteer didn’t see it, as I had turned my back to him; but he may have surmised it, for he began talking to the donkey in meaningful tones; he gave it advice, telling it to behave, saying that “the gentleman” might punish it: a paternal monologue. For heaven’s sake! I even heard the smack of a kiss; the muleteer had kissed it on the forehead.",20,RO005TR06
1971,341,“Well!” I exclaimed.,20,RO005TR06
1972,342,"“Forgive me, sir, but I’ll be damned if the beast isn’t giv’n’ us such a charming look . . .”",20,RO005TR06
1973,343,"I laughed, hesitated, placed a silver cruzado1 in his hand, mounted the donkey, and went off at a brisk trot, somewhat discomfited, or rather, somewhat uncertain of the coin’s effect. But at some yards’ distance, I looked back; the muleteer was bowing and scraping, with evident signs of contentment. And he must have been; I had paid him handsomely, perhaps too well at that. I put my hand into the pocket of the waistcoat I had on and felt a few copper coins; these were the vinténs I ought to have given the muleteer, instead of the silver cruzado.",20,RO005TR06
1974,344,"After all, he had not sought any reward or virtue, he had given in to a natural impulse, to the temperament and the habit of his profession; moreover, the circumstance of his being neither farther ahead nor behind, but at precisely the point where the accident occurred, would seem to indicate that he had been a simple instrument of Providence; and in either case, the merit of the act was positively naught. This reflection distressed me; I called myself a spendthrift and credited the cruzado to my old extravagances; I felt (why not say it all?), I felt remorse.",20,RO005TR06
1975,345,CHAPTER XXII,20,RO005TR06
1976,346,RETURN TO RIO,20,RO005TR06
1977,347,"You blasted donkey, you’ve snapped the thread of my thoughts. Now I’ll not say what I thought of from there to Lisbon, nor what I did in Lisbon, on the peninsula and in other places in Europe—old Europe, which just then seemed to be growing young again. No, I’ll not say that I gazed on the dawn of Romanticism or that I, too, went to live out a few romantic poems in the bosom of Italy; I’ll say nothing at all. For that I would have to write a travel diary, and not memoirs such as these, in which only the substance of life may enter.",20,RO005TR06
1978,348,"After some years of peregrinations, I heeded my father’s pleas. “Come,” he had written in the last letter; “if you do not come quickly, you will find your mother dead!” This last word was a blow to me. I loved my mother; I could still see the last time she had given me her blessing, on board the ship. “My poor son, I shall never see you again,” the wretched lady had wept, pressing me to her breast. And those words now rang to my ear as a prophecy fulfilled.",20,RO005TR06
1979,349,"Note that I was in Venice, still wafting of the verses of Lord Byron; there I was, steeped in a dream, reliving the past tense, seeing myself back in the Most Serene Republic. It’s true; once I happened to ask the innkeeper if there would be a procession of the doge that day. “What doge, signor mio?” I came to my senses, but I didn’t confess my fancy; I said that my question was a sort of American riddle; he gave signs of understanding, and added that he liked American riddles very much. He was, after all, an innkeeper. Well, I left all that, the innkeeper, the doge, the Bridge of Sighs, the gondola, the verses of the lord, the ladies of the Rialto. I left everything and set off like a bullet in the direction of Rio de Janeiro.",20,RO005TR06
1980,350,"I came . . . But no, let’s not prolong this chapter. At times I forget myself as I write, and the pen sets to devouring paper, at great cost to me, the author. Long chapters are better suited for ponderous readers; and we are not much for folios, but rather duodecimos,1 with little text, broad margins, an elegant type, gilt edges, and illustrations . . . especially illustrations . . . No, let’s not prolong the chapter.",20,RO005TR06

1982,352,"SAD, BUT SHORT",20,RO005TR06
1983,353,"I came. I’ll not deny that, upon sighting the city of my birth, I felt a new sensation. This was not the effect of my political homeland; it was that of the place of my childhood. This street, that tower, the fountain on the corner, women in mantillas, hired-out slaves working odd jobs, the things and scenes of boyhood, engraved into memory. Nothing less than a rebirth. My spirit, like a bird, paid no mind to the current of the years, turned the course of its flight toward the primordial font and went to drink of its fresh, pure water, which was yet to mingle with the torrent of life.",20,RO005TR06
1984,354,"Upon further consideration, there’s a commonplace there. Another commonplace, sadly common, was my family’s affliction. My father embraced me in tears.",20,RO005TR06
1985,355,"“Your mother can live no longer,” he said.",20,RO005TR06
1986,356,"Indeed, it was no longer rheumatism that was killing her, but a cancer of the stomach. The poor thing was suffering cruelly, for cancer is indifferent to virtue; when it gnaws, it gnaws; to gnaw is its profession. My sister Sabina, by then married to Cotrim, was staggering with fatigue. Poor girl! She slept three hours a night, nothing more. Uncle João himself was downcast and sad. Dona Eusébia and a few other ladies were there as well, no less sad and no less devoted.",20,RO005TR06
1987,357,“My son!”,20,RO005TR06
1988,358,"The pain withdrew its claws for a short while; a smile shone from the invalid’s face, upon which death was beating its eternal wing. It was less a face than a skull: beauty had passed, like a bright day, and left only bones, which never grow thin. I could barely recognize her; it had been eight or nine years since we had seen each other last. Kneeling by the bed with her hands between mine, I stayed mute and still, not daring to speak; each word would be a sob, and we feared forewarning her of the end. A vain fear! She knew how near it was; she told me so; we saw it for ourselves the next morning.",20,RO005TR06
1989,359,"Long was the agony, long and cruel, a painstaking, cold, unrelenting cruelty that filled me with pain and stupefaction. This was the first time that I had seen someone die. I knew death by hearsay; at most I had seen it petrified on the face of some cadaver that I accompanied to the cemetery, or had my idea of it wrapped up in the rhetorical amplifications of professors of ancient things—Caesar’s treacherous death; Socrates’ austere death; Cato’s proud death. But this duel between to be and not to be, death in action, aching, doubled up, convulsing, with no political or philosophical trappings, the death of a loved one, this was the first time I had looked full at it.",20,RO005TR06
1990,360,"I didn’t cry; I remember that I didn’t cry during the spectacle: my eyes were vacant, my throat choked, my mind agape. What? Such a docile, sweet, saintly creature who had never caused a single tear to be shed, a tender mother and immaculate spouse—did she have to die this way, racked with pain, pierced by the dogged tooth of a merciless disease? I confess that all this struck me as opaque, incongruous, insane . . .",20,RO005TR06

1993,363,"SHORT, BUT HAPPY",20,RO005TR06
1994,364,"I was left prostrate. And yet I was, at that time, a faithful compendium of triviality and presumption. The problem of life and death had never weighed on my brain; never, until that day, had I gazed into the abyss of the Inexplicable; I lacked that essential thing, that impulse, that vertigo . . .",20,RO005TR06
1995,365,"To tell you the whole truth, I reflected the opinions of a hairdresser I met in Modena, who distinguished himself by having none whatsoever. He was the flower of the hairdressers; as long as the hairdressing process might be, it was never tiresome; he alternated strokes of the brush with jokes and banter, full of wit and flavor . . . He had no other philosophy. Nor did I. I won’t say that the University taught me none whatsoever; but I had only memorized the formulas, the vocabulary, the skeleton. I dealt with it as I did Latin; I pocketed three lines of Virgil, two of Horace, and a dozen moral and political maxims, to be dispensed in conversation. I dealt with them as I did history and jurisprudence. I plucked from all things the phraseology, the shell, the ornamentation . . .1",20,RO005TR06
1996,366,"The reader may be taken aback by the frankness with which I expose and emphasize my own mediocrity; he should recall that frankness is the primary virtue of a late man. In life, the gaze of public opinion, the clash of interests, the struggle between rival greeds oblige us to hide our old rags, to disguise splits and stitches, to not extend to the world that which we reveal to our conscience; and the best of this obligation is when, by dint of deluding others, a man deludes himself, because in this case he is spared humiliation, which is a painful sensation, and hypocrisy, which is a ghastly vice.",20,RO005TR06
1997,367,"But in death, what a difference! What an unburdening! What freedom! How we can shake off our cloaks, toss our spangles into the gutter, unbutton ourselves, unpaint ourselves, unadorn ourselves, confess plainly what we were and what we failed to be! Because, after all, there are no more neighbors, nor friends, nor enemies, nor acquaintances, nor strangers; there is no audience. The gaze of opinion, that piercing, judicial gaze, loses all its power as soon as we set foot in the territory of death; this is not to say that it doesn’t reach this far, examining and judging us; but it is we who have no compunctions about the examination or the judgment. My good living sirs and madams, there is nothing so incommensurable as the disdain of the deceased.",20,RO005TR06

2001,371,"On the seventh day, after the Mass, I gathered up a gun, a few books, clothes, cigars, a slave boy—Prudêncio, from Chapter XI—and sought refuge in an old house we owned. My father strove to dissuade me, but I could not have obeyed him, even if I had wanted to. Sabina wanted me to live with her for a time, two weeks at the least, and my brother-in-law was on the verge of bringing me by force. A good fellow, Cotrim had gone from extravagance to prudence. Now he dealt in imported goods and worked from morning to night, fervently and doggedly. At night, sitting by the window and twisting his side whiskers, he thought of nothing but work. He loved his wife and the son they had then, who died a few years later. People said he was avaricious.",20,RO005TR06
2002,372,"I renounced everything; my spirit was stunned. I believe that this is when hypochondria began to unfurl within me, that yellow flower, a solitary and morbid bloom with an intoxicating, subtle scent. “’Tis good to be sad and say nothing!” When these words of Shakespeare drew my attention, I confess that I felt them echo within me, a delightful echo.",20,RO005TR06
2003,373,"I recall that I was sitting under a tamarind tree with the poet’s book open in my hands, my spirit even more downcast than my figure—crestfallen, or jururu, as we say of sulking chickens. I clasped my taciturn grief to my breast with a unique sensation, something I might call the voluptuousness of woe. The voluptuousness of woe: learn that phrase by heart, reader; keep it for yourself, study it, and if you never do come to understand it, you may conclude that you are ignorant of one of the subtlest sensations of this world and that time.",20,RO005TR06
2004,374,"At times I hunted, at others I slept, at others I read—I read a great deal—and at others I did nothing at all; I let myself drift from idea to idea, from fancy to fancy, like a wandering or famished butterfly. The hours dripped one by one, the sun sank, the shadows of night veiled the mountain and the city. No one came to visit me; I had recommended expressly that I be left alone. One day, two, three, an entire week spent without saying a word would be enough to dislodge me from Tijuca and restore me to the busy throng.",20,RO005TR06
2005,375,"Indeed, after seven days I was sick of solitude; the pain had subsided; my soul was no longer satisfied with shooting and books, nor with the sight of the trees and the sky. Youth stirred; I had to live. I stowed the problems of life and death, the poet’s melancholy, my shirts, my meditations, and my cravats away in my trunk and was about to close it when Prudêncio the slave boy came to say that a person of my acquaintance had moved to a red house just two hundred paces from ours.",20,RO005TR06

2010,380,"I immediately thought of the incident from 1814, and felt chagrined; but I saw that events had proved me right. In fact, it had been impossible to turn a deaf ear or a blind eye to the intimate relations between Vilaça and the sergeant-major’s sister; even before my departure, there were mysterious mutterings about the birth of a baby girl. My uncle João sent word later that when Vilaça died, he left a sizable bequest to Dona Eusébia, which set the entire neighborhood talking.",20,RO005TR06
2011,381,"Uncle João, a glutton for scandals, spoke of nothing else in the letter, which was many pages long at that. Events had proved me right.

We spoke of it only once, in passing, when my father brought the conversation back to the Regency; that was when he alluded to the letter of condolence that one of the regents had sent him. He had the letter with him; it was quite creased by that point, perhaps from having been read to many other people. I believe I’ve said that it was from one of the regents.

She was pretty, fresh-faced, come from the hands of nature, brimming with that fragile and eternal enchantment that one individual gives off to another for the secret designs of creation. This was Virgília, and she was fair, very fair, coquettish, ignorant, childish, brimming with mysterious impulses, a great deal of laziness and some measure of piety—piety or perhaps fear; I believe it was fear.",20,RO005TR06

Indeed, she seemed to be even more of a woman than she was in fact; she might be a child when left to her youthful devices, but once quiet and impassive, she had the composure of a married woman. This may have diminished her virginal charm somewhat. We shortly became familiar; her mother praised her to no end, I listened to the praise readily, and the girl smiled, her eyes shining, as if a butterfly were flitting around inside her head with wings of gold and diamond eyes . . .",20,RO005TR06
2094,464,"I say inside her head, because on the outside what came fluttering up was a black butterfly, which suddenly invaded the veranda and began batting its wings around Dona Eusébia. She gave a shriek, stood up, and let out a few stray imprecations:",20,RO005TR06

I shook their hands and left, chuckling to myself at the two women’s superstition; it was a philosophical chuckle, aloof and superior. That afternoon I saw Dona Eusébia’s daughter riding by on horseback, with a slave following after; she flicked her whip by way of a greeting.

2100,470,"The next day, as I was preparing to go down to the city, a butterfly came into my room, just as black as the other one and much larger. I recalled the incident of the day before and laughed; I soon thought of Dona Eusébia’s daughter, the fright she’d taken, and the dignity she had nonetheless been able to preserve. The butterfly, after fluttering around me for some time, landed on my forehead. I brushed it away; it landed on the windowpane; and, when I brushed it away again, it flew off and landed atop an old portrait of my father.",20,RO005TR06
2101,471,"It was black as night. The gentle way in which it began moving its wings, once settled, had a sneering air1 that greatly displeased me. I shrugged and left the room; but when I returned, minutes later, to find it in the same place, I felt a sudden urge, snatched up a towel, struck it, and it fell.",20,RO005TR06
2102,472,"It wasn’t dead; its body still twitched, and its feelers still moved. I felt sorry for it, placed it in the palm of my hand and went to put it on the windowsill. Too late; the unfortunate creature expired after a few seconds. This left me somewhat bothered, put out.",20,RO005TR06
2103,473,“Why the devil couldn’t it have been blue?” I said to myself.,20,RO005TR06
2104,474,"And this reflection—one of the most profound to be produced since the invention of butterflies—consoled me for my misdeed, and I made peace with myself. I let myself contemplate the cadaver with some affection, I confess. I imagined that it had left the forest, content and having breakfasted. The morning was lovely. It had wandered out, modest and black, reveling in its butterflydom, below the vast dome of a blue sky—the sky which is always blue, no matter the color of one’s wings.",20,RO005TR06
2105,475,"It went in through my window and happened upon me. I presume it had never seen a man; therefore, it could not know what a man was; it traced countless circles around my body and saw that I moved, that I had eyes, arms, legs, a divine air, colossal stature. Then it said to itself: “This is probably the inventor of butterflies.”",20,RO005TR06
2106,476,"The idea overpowered it, cowed it; but fear, which may also be persuasive, insinuated to the butterfly that the best way to thank its maker would be to kiss him on the forehead, and so it kissed me on the forehead. When I brushed it away, it landed on the windowpane, and from there it spotted the portrait of my father. It may well have hit upon a half-truth—that this was the father of the inventor of butterflies—and, accordingly, it flew over to beg his mercy.2",20,RO005TR06
2107,477,"Then a towel-blow brought its adventure to an end. Not the blue vastness, nor the joy of the flowers, nor the splendor of the green leaves could avail it against a hand-towel, two spans of raw linen. See how good it is to be superior to butterflies! It must be said: if it were blue or orange, its life would have been no safer; it was not impossible that I might have run it through with a pin, the better to admire it. Indeed, it was not. This latter idea restored my consolation; I put my middle finger to my thumb, dispatched a flick, and the cadaver fell into the garden. Just the right time; there came the provident ants . . . No, back to the first idea; I believe it would have been better for it to have been born blue.",20,RO005TR06

I’m going down right away; and go down I will, even if some circumspect reader should stop me to ask if the last chapter was merely insipid or if his leg is being pulled . . . Alas, I hadn’t reckoned with Dona Eusébia. I was all ready to leave when she appeared at the house. She had come to invite me to put off my descent and dine with them that day. I went so far as to refuse; but she pressed, pressed, and pressed until I was forced to accept; after all, I owed her as much; and so I went.",20,RO005TR06
2111,481,"Eugênia disadorned herself that day on my account. I believe it was on my account, but she might have gone about that way quite often. Not even the gold earrings she had worn the day before hung from her ears now, two finely shaped ears on the head of a nymph. A simple white muslin dress; no brooch at the neck, but a mother-of-pearl button, with another button at the wrist to fasten the cuffs, and not a bracelet in sight.",20,RO005TR06
2112,482,"That was the body; as for the spirit, it was hardly different. Clear ideas, simple manners, a certain natural grace, the air of a lady, and perhaps something else; yes, her mouth, exactly the same as her mother’s, which reminded me of the incident of 1814 and inspired an urge to improvise on the same theme with the daughter . . .",20,RO005TR06
2113,483,"“Now I’ll show you the grounds,” said the mother, as soon as we had drunk the last drop of coffee.",20,RO005TR06
2114,484,"We went out onto the veranda, from there to the grounds, and it was then that I noticed something. Eugênia limped slightly, so slightly that I even asked if she’d hurt her foot. Her mother fell silent; but she responded without hesitation:",20,RO005TR06
2115,485,"“No, sir, I was born lame.”",20,RO005TR06
2116,486,"I cursed myself heartily; I called myself an ass and a lout. Of course the very possibility of her being lame would have sufficed for me to not ask anything. Then I recalled that the first time I had seen her—the day before—she had come over to her mother’s chair slowly, and that later I had found her already seated at the supper table. Perhaps that was to conceal the defect; but why then would she confess it now? I looked at her and found her downcast.",20,RO005TR06
2117,487,"I worked to erase the vestiges of my blunder; this did not prove difficult, for her mother was, in her own words, a saucy old woman, and promptly struck up a conversation with me. We saw all there was to see on the grounds—trees, flowers, the duck pond, the laundry, countless things that Dona Eusébia showed to me and remarked on, as I, all the while, stealthily perused Eugênia’s gaze . . .",20,RO005TR06
2118,488,"I swear to you that Eugênia’s gaze was not lame but straight, perfectly sound; it came from a pair of calm, black eyes.

2121,491,"The pity was that she was lame. Such clear eyes, such a sweet mouth, such a stately bearing; and lame! The contrast might imply that nature is, at times, a tremendous joke at our expense. Why pretty, if lame? Why lame, if pretty? This was the question I posed to myself as I returned home that night, without lighting on the solution to the enigma. The best thing to do when one can’t resolve an enigma is to throw it out the window; and that was what I did; I snatched up a towel and shooed away this, the other black butterfly flapping around my brain. Thus relieved, I went to sleep. But dreams, which are a cranny leading to the soul, let the little creature in again, and I spent the whole night poring over the mystery, finding no explanation.",20,RO005TR06
2122,492,"The morning brought rain, and I put off my return; but on the next day the morning was clear and blue, and in spite of that I stayed, as I did on the third day, and the fourth, and through the end of the week. Lovely, fresh, inviting mornings; down below was my family calling me, and my bride-to-be, and Parliament; I was deaf to it all, enraptured at the feet of my crippled Venus. Enraptured is merely a rhetorical flourish; there was no rapture, but rather pleasure, a certain physical and moral satisfaction. I liked her, it’s true; next to such a simple creature, a lame and bastard daughter, formed of love and disgrace, next to her I felt good, and as for her, I believe she felt even better next to me. And all this in Tijuca. A veritable eclogue. Dona Eusébia kept watch over us, but it was far from rigorous; she tempered necessity with convenience.

2125,495,“Don’t.”,20,RO005TR06
2126,496,"I didn’t, and I added a new verse to the Gospels: Blessed are they that go not down, for theirs is the young ladies’ first kiss. And indeed, Sunday brought Eugênia’s first kiss—the first any man had taken from her, and not stolen or seized, but given up artlessly, as an honest debtor pays a debt. Poor Eugênia! If you only knew what ideas were wandering through my mind on that occasion! You, trembling with emotion, your arms on my shoulders, contemplating me as your heaven-sent spouse, and I with my eyes on 1814, the thicket, Vilaça, suspecting that you could not flee from your blood, your origin . . .",20,RO005TR06
2127,497,"Dona Eusébia came in unexpectedly, but not so suddenly as to catch us together. I went over to the window; Eugênia sat down, fixing one of her braids. What delightful dissembling! What a boundless, delicate art! What profound Tartuffism!1 And it was all so natural, so vibrant and unaffected, as natural as eating or sleeping. So much the better! Dona Eusébia suspected nothing.",20,RO005TR06

2129,499,TO A SENSITIVE SOUL,20,RO005TR06
2130,500,"Among the five or ten people reading me, there is a sensitive soul who is doubtless a bit distressed by the previous chapter, has begun to quake for Eugênia’s fate, and perhaps . . . yes, perhaps, deep down, may be calling me a cynic. I, a cynic, sensitive soul? By Diana’s thigh! That insult ought to be washed away with blood, if blood ever washed away anything in this world.",20,RO005TR06
2131,501,"No, sensitive soul, I am no cynic, I was a man; my brain was a theater in which plays of all genres were staged, sacred plays, austere dramas, sentimental works, gay comedies, topsy-turvy farces, morality plays, burlesque—pure pandemonium, sensitive soul, a tumult of things and people in which you might see everything, from the rose of Smyrna to the rue growing in your own backyard, from Cleopatra’s magnificent couch to the corner of the beach where a beggar shivers away the night.",20,RO005TR06
2132,502,"It was host to thoughts of the most various castes and complexions. Nor was it the sole province of the eagle and the hummingbird; the slug’s and the toad’s habitats were represented there as well. Take back those words, then, sensitive soul, give your nerves a shake, clean off your eyeglasses—sometimes it’s all in the eyeglasses—and let us do away with this thicket flower once and for all.",20,RO005TR06

2134,504,THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS,20,RO005TR06
2135,505,"Now it so happened that, a week later, as if I were on the road to Damascus, I heard a mysterious voice whispering the words of the Scripture (Acts 9:6): “Arise, and go into the city.” The voice came from me, and it sprang from two things: pity, which disarmed me before the girl’s innocence, and the dread of coming to truly love her and wed her. A crippled wife! As for the second motive for my departure, there is no doubt that she perceived it, and told me so. It was on the veranda, on a Monday afternoon, after I had announced that I would go down to the city the next morning.",20,RO005TR06
2136,506,"“Goodbye,” she sighed, holding out her hand with a natural air. “You’re doing the right thing.” And as I said nothing, she went on: “You’re doing the right thing, running away from the laughable idea of marrying me.”",20,RO005TR06
2137,507,"I was going to deny it; she retired slowly, choking back her tears. I overtook her in a few steps and swore by all the saints in heaven that I had to go, but that I still cared for her, very much so; all listless hyperboles, which she listened to without saying a word.",20,RO005TR06
2138,508,“Do you believe me?” I asked her at the end.,20,RO005TR06
2139,509,“No. And I say that you’re doing the right thing.”,20,RO005TR06
2140,510,"I moved to hold her back; but the gaze she directed at me was no longer entreating, but commanding. I came down from Tijuca the following morning, a bit aggrieved, but another bit satisfied. As I came, I repeated to myself that it was right to obey my father, that it was only proper to embrace a political career . . . that the Constitution . . . that my bride-to-be . . . that my horse . . .",20,RO005TR06

2142,512,ON THE SUBJECT OF BOOTS,20,RO005TR06
2143,513,"My father, who hadn’t been expecting me, embraced me with affection and gratitude.",20,RO005TR06
2144,514,“Is it really true?” he asked. “May I at last . . . ?”,20,RO005TR06
2145,515,"I left him in his ellipsis and went to take off my boots, which were tight. Once relieved, I breathed deeply and stretched out while my feet, and all the rest of myself after them, entered into relative bliss. Then I pondered that tight boots are one of the greatest blessings on earth, for by causing one’s feet to hurt, they make way for the pleasure of taking them off.",20,RO005TR06
2146,516,"Mortify your feet, wretch, then unmortify them, and there you have cheap happiness, befitting both shoemakers and Epicurus. As this idea worked away on my famous trapeze, I cast my eyes to Tijuca, saw the little crippled girl vanish away on the horizon of the past tense, and felt that my heart would not be long in taking off its own boots. And take them off it did, the wanton thing.",20,RO005TR06
2147,517,"Four or five days later, it would savor that swift, ineffable, irrepressible moment of pleasure that follows a racking pain, a worry, a discomfort . . . From this I inferred that life is the most ingenious of all phenomena, as it sharpens hunger only for the purpose of providing occasion to eat, and it invented corns only because they work to perfect earthly happiness. Verily I say unto you that the sum total of human wisdom isn’t worth a pair of tight boots.",20,RO005TR06
2148,518,"As for you, my Eugênia, you never took your boots off; you went off along the road of life, limping from your leg and from love, sad as a pauper’s burial, solitary, quiet, unflagging, until you, too, arrived at this other shore . . . What I cannot say is whether your existence was quite necessary to the age. Who knows? One fewer supernumerary and the whole human tragedy might have been booed off the stage.1",20,RO005TR06

2151,521,"At last! Here we have Virgília. Before going to Counselor Dutra’s house, I asked my father if there was any prior arrangement about the marriage.",20,RO005TR06
2152,522,"“No arrangement whatsoever. Some time ago, when I was speaking with him about you, I confessed my desire to see you in the Chamber of Deputies; I said it in such a way that he promised to do something, and I believe he will. As for the bride, that’s just my word for a little creature who’s a gem, a flower, a star, a rare thing indeed . . . She’s his daughter; I imagined that if you married her, you would find yourself a deputy more quickly.”",20,RO005TR06
2153,523,“Is that all?”,20,RO005TR06
2154,524,“That’s all.”,20,RO005TR06
2155,525,"From there we went to Dutra’s house. The man was a pearl—smiling, jovial, patriotic, somewhat out of sorts about society’s ills, but not yet despairing of mending them quickly. He judged my candidacy solid; it would be best, however, to wait a few months. In short order he introduced me to his wife—an estimable lady—and his daughter, who did not belie my father’s panegyric in the slightest. I swear to you, not in the slightest. Reread Chapter XXVII. I, who had my ideas about the girl, gazed at her in a certain way; she, who may have had ideas of her own, returned the gaze in kind; and our first look was purely and simply conjugal. After a month’s time we were on intimate terms.",20,RO005TR06

2157,527,THE FOURTH EDITION,20,RO005TR06
2158,528,"“Come dine with us tomorrow,” Dutra said to me one night.",20,RO005TR06
2159,529,"I accepted the invitation. The following day, I had my coach wait for me at the Largo de São Francisco de Paula, and I went out for a stroll. Do you still recall my theory of human editions? Well, know, then, that at that time I was in my fourth edition, revised and amended, but still infested with lapses and barbarisms, a defect that found some compensation in the type, which was elegant, and the binding, which was luxurious. Having strolled far and wide, I took out my watch as I went down the Rua dos Ourives, and the glass fell onto the sidewalk. I went into the first shop at hand; it was little more than a dark, dusty box.",20,RO005TR06
2160,530,"At the back, behind the counter, there sat a woman whose yellow, pockmarked face could not be made out at first glance; but once it came into view, it was a curious spectacle. She could not have been ugly; on the contrary, it was clear that she had been pretty, and not a little; but the disease and a precocious old age had destroyed the flower of her charms. The smallpox had been ruinous; the marks, which were large and numerous, had left protuberances and furrows, slopes and ruts, giving the impression of sandpaper, terribly rough sandpaper.",20,RO005TR06
2161,531,"Her eyes were the better part of her figure, but they bore a singular and repugnant expression, which changed, however, as soon as I began to speak. As for her hair, it was gray and nearly as grimy as the shop front. On one of the fingers of her left hand there gleamed a diamond. Will you believe it, posterity? That woman was Marcela.",20,RO005TR06
2162,532,"I didn’t recognize her straightaway; it was difficult; but she recognized me as soon as I addressed her. Her eyes sparkled and their ordinary expression was replaced by another, somewhere between sweet and sad. I saw her move as if to hide or flee; this was the instinct of vanity, which lasted no more than an instant. Marcela settled back and smiled.",20,RO005TR06
2163,533,"“Would you like to buy something?” she asked, holding out a hand.",20,RO005TR06
2164,534,"I said nothing. Marcela understood the cause of my silence (it was not difficult), and only hesitated, I believe, in deciding which was foremost, the astonishment of the present or the memory of the past. She offered me a chair, and, with the counter between us, she told me at length of herself, the life she had lived, the tears I had made her shed, the longing, the misfortunes, and finally the pox, which had blighted her face, and time, which had helped the malady along in accelerating her decay.",20,RO005TR06
2165,535,"The truth is that her very soul was decrepit. She had sold everything, nearly everything; a man who had once loved her and died in her arms had left her the jeweler’s; but as if to crown her ill fortune, the shop was now little frequented—perhaps for the singular fact of its being run by a woman. Then she asked me to tell of my life. I spent very little time in doing so; the story was neither long nor interesting.",20,RO005TR06
2166,536,“Are you married?” Marcela asked at the end of my narrative.,20,RO005TR06
2167,537,"“Not yet,” I replied tersely.",20,RO005TR06
2168,538,"Marcela turned her gaze to the street, with the blank look of one caught in reflection or recollection; I also let myself drift to the past, and, amidst the memories and nostalgia, I wondered why I had gone to such foolish lengths. This was certainly not the Marcela of 1822; but was her former beauty worth even a third of my sacrifices? That was what I sought to glean from Marcela’s face. The face told me no; at the same time, the eyes told me that then, as now, the flame of greed burned bright within them. Mine had been unable to see it; they were first-edition eyes.",20,RO005TR06
2169,539,"“But why did you come in? Did you see me from the street?” she asked, coming out of her torpor.",20,RO005TR06
2170,540,"“No, I thought it was a watchmaker’s; I wanted to buy a glass for this watch. I’ll go somewhere else; forgive me, I’m in a hurry.”",20,RO005TR06
2171,541,"Marcela sighed mournfully. The truth is that I felt both distressed and vexed, and yearned to be free of the place. Marcela, however, called a slave boy, gave him the watch, and, over my protests, sent him to a nearby shop to buy the glass. There was nothing to be done; I sat down again. She then said that she would be glad of the patronage of her old acquaintances; she surmised that sooner or later I would, of course, marry, and guaranteed that she would find me fine jewels for cheap prices.",20,RO005TR06
2172,542,"She didn’t say cheap prices, but rather used a delicate, transparent metaphor. I began to suspect that she had suffered no great misfortune (save the disease), that her money was safe and sound, and that she negotiated with the sole aim of feeding her passion for profit, which was the gnawing worm at the heart of her existence. That was precisely what I was told later on.",20,RO005TR06

2177,547,"“So-so. Come here, Maricota.”",20,RO005TR06
2178,548,The fellow picked the child up by her arms and set her on the other side of the counter.,20,RO005TR06
2179,549,"“Come now,” he said, “ask Dona Marcela if she had a good night. She was eager to come here, but her mother hadn’t been able to get her dressed . . . Well, Maricota? Go on, kiss her hand . . . You don’t want a switching, do you? That’s the way . . . You can’t imagine her at home; she speaks of you all the live-long day, and now she sits here like a lump. Just yesterday . . . Shall I tell her, Maricota?”",20,RO005TR06
2180,550,"“Don’t, Papa.”",20,RO005TR06
2181,551,"“Was it something bad, then?” Marcela asked, patting the girl on the cheek.",20,RO005TR06
2182,552,"“I’ll tell you; her mother taught her to say the Lord’s Prayer and the Hail Mary every night to Our Lady; but yesterday the little one came to ask me, very meekly . . . can you imagine what? She wanted to offer her prayers to Saint Marcela.”",20,RO005TR06
2183,553,"“Poor thing!” said Marcela, giving her a kiss.",20,RO005TR06

2185,555,"The fellow told a few more anecdotes, all quite pleasant, before leaving with the girl, but not without casting a questioning look, or perhaps a suspicious one, in my direction. I asked Marcela who he was.",20,RO005TR06
2186,556,"“He’s a watchmaker in the neighborhood, a good man; so is his wife; and the daughter is delightful, isn’t she? They seem to have taken a liking to me . . . they are good people.”",20,RO005TR06

2189,559,IN THE COACH,20,RO005TR06
2190,560,"At this the slave boy came in bearing the watch, now with a new glass. It was high time, for being there was an ordeal; I gave the boy a silver coin, told Marcela that I would come back another day, and strode out. If the truth be told, I must confess that my heart was pounding a little; but it was a sort of death knell. My spirit was caught between clashing impressions. Note that the day had begun joyfully for me.",20,RO005TR06
2191,561,"Over breakfast my father had recited the first speech that I was to give in the Chamber of Deputies; we laughed heartily, and the sun laughed with us, shining just as on the most beautiful days the world has ever seen—and Virgília would laugh brightly, too, when I told her of our breakfast-table fantasies. And then the glass falls from my watch, I go into the first shop at hand, and the past emerges before me, lacerating me and kissing me, interrogating me, its face disfigured by nostalgia and pockmarks . . .",20,RO005TR06
2192,562,"There I left it; I got hastily into the coach, which was waiting for me at the square, and ordered the coachman to set off. He whipped up the beasts, the coach began to jolt me around, the springs groaned, the wheels quickly plowed through the mud left by the recent rain, and yet everything seemed to stand still.",20,RO005TR06
2193,563,"Doesn’t there sometimes come a certain warm wind, not strong or harsh, but stifling, which neither snatches our hats away nor sets women’s skirts whirling, and yet it is worse, or may seem to be worse, than if it did one or the other, since it casts down, enfeebles, and practically dissolves one’s spirit? Well, that wind blew around me then; and, convinced that it was because I found myself in a narrow pass between the past and the present, I ached to burst out onto the plain of the future. The worst of it was, the coach wasn’t moving.",20,RO005TR06

2197,567,THE HALLUCINATION,20,RO005TR06
2198,568,"It was true. I rushed in; I found Virgília anxious and out of sorts, her brow clouded. Her mother, who was deaf, was in the drawing room with her. After an exchange of greetings, the younger woman said curtly:",20,RO005TR06
2199,569,“We expected you earlier.”,20,RO005TR06
2200,570,"I defended myself as best I could; I spoke of a balky horse and a friend who’d kept me. Suddenly my voice died on my lips as I was paralyzed by astonishment. Virgília . . . was this young lady Virgília? I stared at her at length, and the sensation was so painful that I took a step back and turned my gaze away. I looked again. Pockmarks had eaten away at her face; her skin, only recently so fine, rosy, and pure, now looked yellowed, afflicted with the same malady that had devastated the Spanish lady’s face. Her eyes, once mischievous, had gone dull; her mouth was dejected, her air weary. I looked at her closely; I took her by the hand and drew her gently to me. I wasn’t mistaken; there were the pockmarks. I think I showed some sign of disgust.",20,RO005TR06
2201,571,"Virgília moved away and went to sit on the sofa. I contemplated my feet for a while. Should I leave or stay? I rejected the first device, which was simply absurd, and went over to Virgília, who was sitting there quietly. Good Lord! There, once again, was the fair, young, flowering Virgília. I sought in vain for any sign of the disease on her face; there was none; only the same fine, white skin as always.",20,RO005TR06
2202,572,"“Haven’t you ever seen me before?” asked Virgília, seeing that I was staring intently at her.",20,RO005TR06
2203,573,“Never so lovely.”,20,RO005TR06
2204,574,"I sat down as Virgília clicked her fingernails, not saying a word. There was a pause of a few seconds. I spoke of things unrelated to the incident; but she gave no answer, nor would she look at me. Except for the clicking, she was Silence on a monument. Only once did she let her eyes fall on me, superciliously, as she raised the left corner of her lip and furrowed her brows until they met; this lent her face an expression halfway between comic and tragic.",20,RO005TR06
2205,575,"There was a measure of affectation in that disdain; there were airs in the gesture. Inside she was suffering, and not a little, whether it was pure distress or only spite; and since dissembled pains hurt all the worse, it is quite probable that Virgília was actually suffering twice as much as she really should have been. I believe that is metaphysical.",20,RO005TR06

2207,577,WHICH ESCAPED ARISTOTLE,20,RO005TR06
2208,578,"Another thing that also strikes me as metaphysical is this: a ball is put in motion, for example; it rolls, comes up against another ball, transmits the driving force, and here we have the second ball rolling just as the first did. Let us suppose that the first ball is called . . . Marcela—a mere supposition—while the second ball is called Brás Cubas, and the third, Virgília.",20,RO005TR06
2209,579,"Thus we have it that Marcela, receiving a flick from the past, rolled until it touched Brás Cubas, which, ceding to that propulsive force, set off rolling until it ran into Virgília, which had nothing to do with the first ball; this is how, through the simple transmission of force, social extremes may touch one another, creating what we may call the solidarity of human disgruntlement.

2213,583,"Then there came Lobo Neves, a man who was not more svelte than I was, nor more elegant, nor more educated, nor more winning, and nonetheless it was he who took both Virgília and the candidacy from me in a matter of weeks, in a truly Caesarean stroke. There was no precipitating incident; there was no violence between houses. Dutra simply came one day to tell me that I was to wait for more favorable winds, since Lobo Neves’s candidacy was backed by influential figures. I gave in; this was the beginning of my defeat.

2218,588,"From there on out, I was lost. Virgília compared the eagle and the peacock and chose the eagle, leaving the peacock with his astonishment, his resentment, and three or four kisses she had given him. Perhaps five kisses; but had they been ten, it would have been all the same. A man’s lip is not like the hoof of Attila’s horse, which left the soil it struck barren; it is precisely the opposite.",20,RO005TR06

2221,591,"My father was aghast at the outcome, and I do believe that he died of it. He had erected so many castles, dreamt so many sundry dreams, that he could not see them crumble without suffering a considerable shock to his organism. At first he refused to believe it. A Cubas! A branch of the illustrious tree of the Cubases! And he said this with such conviction that I, having already been informed of our ancestor the cooper, forgot my fickle lady for a moment and simply contemplated this phenomenon, which, while not rare, was nonetheless curious: a figment of imagination promoted to the rank of fact.",20,RO005TR06
2222,592,"“A Cubas!” he repeated to me the following morning, over breakfast.",20,RO005TR06
2223,593,"This breakfast was not a happy affair; for my part, I was exhausted. I had lain awake for much of the night. Out of love? Impossible; one can’t love the same woman twice, and I, who would come to love her some time later, was not then tied by any bond other than a passing fantasy, a measure of obedience, and a great deal of vanity. That was enough to explain my sleepless night; it was resentment, a needle-sharp little resentment that was dissipated through cigars, pounding fists, and truncated bouts of reading until the break of dawn, the calmest of dawns.",20,RO005TR06
2224,594,"But I was young, and I bore my remedy in myself. It was my father who could not take the blow so easily. Upon further reflection, the disaster may not have been the precise cause of his death, but it certainly compounded his final pains. He died four months later, disconsolate and forlorn, with an intense, incessant preoccupation, something like remorse, a fatal disillusionment that took the place of his rheumatism and coughing fits.",20,RO005TR06
2225,595,"He was to have one final half-hour of happiness; that was when one of the ministers visited him. I saw on him—I can remember it well—I saw on him the grateful smile of former times, with a concentration of light in his eyes that was, in a way, the last spark of his expiring soul.

2235,605,THE INHERITANCE,20,RO005TR06
2236,606,"Behold us, reader, a week after my father’s death: my sister sitting on a sofa, Cotrim before her, leaning on a console table with his arms crossed, worrying at his moustache, and I pacing up and down, my eyes on the floor. Deep mourning. A great silence.",20,RO005TR06
2237,607,"“But, after all,” said Cotrim, “this house can’t be worth much more than thirty thousand milréis; let us say that it’s worth thirty-five . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2238,608,"“It’s worth fifty,” I maintained. “Sabina knows that it cost fifty-eight . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2239,609,"“It might have cost sixty,” Cotrim replied, “but that doesn’t mean that it was worth it, much less that it’s worth that today. You know that the houses around here have gone down in price over the years. Look here, if this one is worth fifty thousand milréis, how much would the one you want for yourself, out at the Campo, be worth?”",20,RO005TR06
2240,610,“For goodness’ sake! That’s an old house.”,20,RO005TR06
2241,611,"“Old!” exclaimed Sabina, throwing her hands up.",20,RO005TR06
2242,612,"“It seems new to you, I take it?”",20,RO005TR06
2243,613,"“Come now, brother, let’s have none of this,” said Sabina, rising from the sofa. “We can settle things civilly, and be plain with one another. For example, Cotrim won’t take the slaves, he only wants Papa’s coachman and Paulo . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2244,614,"“Not the coachman,” I objected. “The coach is going to me, and I won’t go out and buy another coachman.”",20,RO005TR06
2245,615,“All right; I’ll take Paulo and Prudêncio.”,20,RO005TR06
2246,616,“Prudêncio is free.”,20,RO005TR06
2247,617,“Free?”,20,RO005TR06
2248,618,“It’s been two years now.”,20,RO005TR06
2249,619,"“Free? How your father dealt with these things around here, without telling anyone! Very well. As for the silver . . . he didn’t free that, did he?”",20,RO005TR06
2250,620,"We had already spoken of the silver, the old silverware from the time of King José I, the dearest part of the estate, whether by virtue of its craftsmanship, its antiquity, or its history; my father used to say that Count da Cunha, when he was viceroy of Brazil, had given it to my great-grandfather Luís Cubas as a present.",20,RO005TR06
2251,621,"“As for the silver,” Cotrim went on, “I wouldn’t insist in the slightest if your sister didn’t want it; but I believe she is entitled. Sabina is married and needs a decent, presentable set of silver plate. You’re a bachelor, you don’t entertain, you don’t . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2252,622,“But I may get married.”,20,RO005TR06
2253,623,“What for?” interrupted Sabina.,20,RO005TR06
2254,624,"This question was so sublime that it made me forget my own interests for a few moments. I smiled; I took Sabina’s hand and patted it lightly, all with such a benevolent air that Cotrim interpreted the gesture as one of acquiescence, and thanked me.",20,RO005TR06
2255,625,"“What now?” I rejoined. “I haven’t given up anything, nor do I intend to.”",20,RO005TR06
2256,626,“Don’t you?”,20,RO005TR06
2257,627,I shook my head.,20,RO005TR06
2258,628,"“Never mind, Cotrim,” said my sister to her husband. “See if he wants the clothes off our backs; that’s all he’s missing.”",20,RO005TR06
2259,629,"“There’s nothing missing. He wants the coach, he wants the coachman, he wants the silver, he wants everything. Look here, it’d be much quicker to call us to court and bring witnesses to prove that Sabina isn’t your sister, I’m not your brother-in-law, and God isn’t God. Do that and you won’t lose a thing, not even a teaspoon. Come now, try another one!”",20,RO005TR06
2260,630,"He was so irate, and I no less, that I thought to offer a means of conciliation: dividing up the silver. He laughed and asked who would take the teapot and who would take the sugar bowl; and after this question, he declared that we’d be able to settle the claim in court, at least. Meanwhile, Sabina had gone over to the window overlooking the grounds, and after a moment she came back and suggested giving me Paulo and another slave on the condition that she keep the silver; I was about to say that this didn’t suit me, but Cotrim answered the same thing before I could.",20,RO005TR06
2261,631,“Never! I’m no almsgiver!” he said.,20,RO005TR06
2262,632,"We had a melancholy supper. My uncle the priest showed up at dessert, in time to witness a minor altercation.",20,RO005TR06
2263,633,"“My children,” he said, “remember that my brother left a loaf large enough to be shared with all.”",20,RO005TR06
2264,634,To which Cotrim replied:,20,RO005TR06
2265,635,"“Certainly. The matter, however, is not the bread, but the butter. I won’t be made to swallow dry bread.”",20,RO005TR06
2266,636,"The apportionments were made, in the end, but we had fallen out. And I tell you all that, even so, it pained me greatly to quarrel with Sabina. We had been such friends! The games and quarrels of childhood, the laughter and sorrows of our adult years; we had often broken the bread of joy and misery, fraternally, like the good brother and sister that we were. But we had fallen out. Just as Marcela’s beauty had fallen away with the pox.",20,RO005TR06

2269,639,"Marcela, Sabina, Virgília . . . here I am, blending together all the contrasts, as if these names and people were nothing more than the various manifestations of my innermost affections. Ill-mannered pen of mine, tie a proper cravat around your style and find yourself a slightly less filthy waistcoat; and then you may come with me, come into the house and stretch out in this hammock, where I swayed away the better part of the years between the inventory of my father’s estate and 1842.",20,RO005TR06
2270,640,"Come: if you should detect a waft of dressing-table perfume, do not imagine that I had it scented for my own pleasure; that is a vestige of the lovely N. or Z. or U.—for all those capital letters swayed here as well, in their elegant abjection. But if you should want something besides the aroma, you’ll be left wanting; I kept neither portraits, nor letters, nor memories; even the emotion faded away, and I was left only with the initials.",20,RO005TR06
2271,641,"I became somewhat of a recluse, going now and then to some ball or the theater or a lecture, but spending most of the time by myself. I lived; I let myself drift in the wax and wane of events and days, restive one moment, listless the next, between ambition and dejection. I wrote politics and practiced literature. I sent articles and verses to the papers, and gained a reputation as something of a polemicist and a poet. When I recalled Lobo Neves, who had already become a deputy, and Virgília, the future marchioness, I asked myself why I wouldn’t be a better deputy and a better marquis than Lobo Neves—I, who was so very superior to him—and I pondered this as I stared at the tip of my nose . . .",20,RO005TR06

2273,643,A COUSIN OF VIRGÍLIA’S,20,RO005TR06
2274,644,“Do you know who arrived yesterday from São Paulo?” Luís Dutra asked me one evening.,20,RO005TR06
2275,645,"Luís Dutra was a cousin of Virgília’s, who also communed with the Muses. His verses were better than mine, and better liked; but he craved the approval of some to confirm the praise he received from others. His bashfulness meant that he never asked anyone outright, but he would delight in hearing an admiring word; then he would muster fresh strength and assail the task with youthful zeal.",20,RO005TR06
2276,646,"Poor Luís Dutra! As soon as he published anything at all, he would run to my house and begin circling me, lying in wait for a judgment, a word, a gesture approving of his latest production; and I would speak of a thousand different things—the latest Catete ball, the debates in the legislature, carriages and horses—anything but his verses or prose.",20,RO005TR06
2277,647,"He would reply eagerly at first, then more weakly, then steer the conversation toward his concern, opening a book and asking me if I had anything new written, and I would tell him yes or no, but steer the conversation elsewhere, and there he would follow me until he finally balked and went away downcast. My aim was to make him doubt himself, dispirit him, eliminate him. And all the while, I stared at the tip of my nose . . .",20,RO005TR06
2278,648,CHAPTER XLIX,20,RO005TR06
2279,649,THE TIP OF THE NOSE,20,RO005TR06
2280,650,"Nose, conscience sans remorse, you served me greatly in life . . . Have you ever meditated on the purpose of the nose, beloved reader? Dr. Pangloss’s explanation1 is that the nose was created so we might use eyeglasses, and I’ll confess I found it definitive for a certain time; but there came a day when, in ruminating on these and other obscure philosophical matters, I hit upon the sole, true, definitive explanation.",20,RO005TR06
2281,651,"Indeed, I had only to attend to the habits of the fakir. The reader will know that a fakir spends hours upon hours staring at the tip of his nose with the sole aim of beholding the celestial light. When he trains his eyes on the tip of his nose, he loses all sense of the outside world, becomes enraptured in the invisible, grasps the impalpable, unlashes himself from the earth, dissolves, becomes one with the ether. This sublimation of one’s being via the tip of the nose is the loftiest phenomenon of the spirit, and its obtainment is not the sole province of the fakir: it is universal.",20,RO005TR06
2282,652,"Every man has both the need and the power to contemplate his own nose so as to behold the celestial light, and such contemplation, the effect of which is the subordination of the universe to nothing more than a nose, ensures the equilibrium of societies. If noses only contemplated one another, the human race would never have lasted two centuries: it would have extinguished itself during the first tribes.",20,RO005TR06
2283,653,"At this, I hear an objection from the reader. “How can that be,” he says, “if nobody has ever, never, not once seen men contemplating their own noses?”",20,RO005TR06
2284,654,"Obtuse reader, this merely proves that you have never entered the brain of a hatmaker. A hatmaker passes by a hat shop; this is a rival’s shop, opened two years ago. Back then it had two doors, today it has four; it promises to grow to six, then eight. The rival’s hats flaunt themselves in the windows; the rival’s customers walk in through the doors; the hatmaker compares this shop with his, which is older and still has only two doors, and these hats with his, which are less sought-after, though equally priced.",20,RO005TR06
2285,655,"He is distressed, of course; but he keeps on walking, concentrated, his eyes cast down or staring straight ahead, poring over the causes of the other’s prosperity and his own hardship, when he as a hatmaker is a much better hatmaker than the other hatmaker . . . At this instant, his eyes fix on the tip of his nose.",20,RO005TR06
2286,656,"The conclusion here is that there are two capital forces in this world: love, which multiplies the species, and the nose, which subordinates it to the individual. Procreation, equilibrium.",20,RO005TR06

2294,664,“My father’s idea. Who told you that?”,20,RO005TR06
2295,665,"“She did. I said a good bit about you, and then she told me everything.”",20,RO005TR06
2296,666,"The next day, as I stood on the Rua do Ouvidor at the door of Plancher’s printing office, I saw a splendid woman come into view at a distance. It was she; I only recognized her at a few paces, such was the transformation, so greatly had nature and art refined their work. We greeted one another; she went on her way; she and her husband entered their carriage, which was waiting for them just ahead; I was left stunned.",20,RO005TR06
2297,667,"A week later, I saw her at a ball; I believe we exchanged two or three words. But at another ball, a month later, at the home of a lady who had graced the salons of the First Reign and did not disgrace those of the Second,1 our encounter was closer and lingered longer, for this time we both spoke and waltzed. The waltz is a delightful thing. We waltzed; and I won’t deny that as I held that supple, magnificent body next to mine, I had a singular sensation, that of a man who has been robbed.",20,RO005TR06
2298,668,"“It’s quite hot,” she said as soon as we had finished. “Shall we go out on the terrace?”",20,RO005TR06
2299,669,“No; you might catch cold. Let’s go into the other room.”,20,RO005TR06
2300,670,"In the other room was Lobo Neves, who praised my political writings highly, adding that he would say nothing of my literary work, as he understood nothing of it; but the political writings were excellent, well thought out and well written. I responded in kind, with hearty praise, and we parted quite pleased with one another.",20,RO005TR06
2301,671,"Around three weeks later, I received an invitation for a small gathering at his home. I went; Virgília greeted me with this charming welcome:",20,RO005TR06
2302,672,“You really must waltz with me again tonight.”,20,RO005TR06
2303,673,"It’s true, I was known as a master waltzer; it was no wonder she preferred me. We waltzed once, and once again. A book was Francesca’s undoing; here, the waltz was ours.2 I believe that on that night I took her hand in mine, and she left it in my grasp as if she had forgotten it, while I embraced her and all eyes looked on us and on the others who were also embracing one another and waltzing round and round . . . Pure delirium.",20,RO005TR06

2305,675,MINE!,20,RO005TR06
2306,676,"“Mine!” I said to myself, as soon as I passed her on to another gentleman; and I confess that over the rest of the evening the idea began burying itself in my spirit, not with the force of a hammer, but rather that of a gimlet, which is a more insinuative tool.",20,RO005TR06
2307,677,“Mine!” I said as I arrived at my door.,20,RO005TR06
2308,678,"And then, as if fate or destiny, or whatever it might have been, should have wished to feed my possessive raptures, something round and yellow shone at me from the ground. I bent down; it was a gold coin, a half-dobra.",20,RO005TR06
2309,679,"“Mine!” I repeated, chuckling, and put it in my pocket.",20,RO005TR06
2310,680,"That night I thought no more of the coin; but on the following day, as I recalled the incident, I felt my conscience twitch, and heard a voice asking me why on earth a coin that I had neither inherited nor earned, but simply found on the street, should be mine. Evidently it was not mine; it belonged to another, to whoever had lost it, be he rich or poor, and perhaps he was poor, some worker who no longer had the means to feed his wife and children; even if he were rich, my duty would remain the same.",20,RO005TR06
2311,681,"It was only proper to return the coin, and the best way, the only way, was with the help of a notice or the police. I wrote a letter to the chief of police, sending my find along with it and begging him to use the means at his disposal to return it to the hands of its true owner.",20,RO005TR06
2312,682,"I sent the letter and breakfasted at ease, even jubilantly. My conscience had waltzed so much the previous evening that it had been stifled, left breathless; but the restitution of the half-dobra was a window opening up onto the other side of morality; a wave of pure air wafted in, and my conscience, that poor lady, was able to breathe deeply. Ventilate your consciences! I shall say nothing more. All other circumstances aside, my act was a fine one, as it expressed an honorable concern, the sentiment of a delicate soul. That was what my inner lady said to me, at once austere and mild; that was what she said to me as she leaned on the sill of the open window.",20,RO005TR06
2313,683,"“Very good, Cubas; you’ve behaved perfectly. This air is more than pure, it’s a balsam, a breath from the everlasting gardens. Would you like to see what you’ve done, Cubas?”",20,RO005TR06
2314,684,"And the good lady took out a mirror and held it before my eyes. There I saw, and clearly saw,1 the half-dobra of the previous evening, round, bright, multiplying itself—becoming ten—then thirty—then five hundred—thus expressing the benefits that the simple act of restitution would bring me in life as in death. And as the whole of my being luxuriated in the contemplation of the act, I saw myself in it again and I found myself good, perhaps even great. A simple coin, eh? Just see what a few more turns of the waltz can do.",20,RO005TR06
2315,685,"And so it was that I, Brás Cubas, discovered a sublime law, the law of the equivalence of windows, and determined that the way to compensate for one closed window is to open another, so that morality may continually air out one’s conscience. You may not have understood this; perhaps you would prefer something more concrete—a parcel, for example, a mysterious parcel. Well, here you have a mysterious parcel.",20,RO005TR06

2317,687,THE MYSTERIOUS PARCEL,20,RO005TR06
2318,688,"So it was that, a few days later, as I was on my way to Botafogo, I stumbled across a parcel on the beach. That’s not quite right; it was less of a stumble than a kick. Seeing a parcel, not large, but clean and well tied with thick twine, a thing that looked like it was something, I decided to give it a kick, just to see what would happen, and so I did, and the parcel held up. I cast my eyes around me; the beach was deserted; off in the distance—a few boys playing—a fisherman mending his nets even farther off—nobody who might see what I was up to; I bent over, picked up the parcel, and went on.",20,RO005TR06
2319,689,"I went on, but not without apprehensions. This might be some boys’ prank. I thought of returning my find to the beach, but I felt the parcel and rejected the idea. A bit farther along, I changed course and headed home.",20,RO005TR06
2320,690,"“Let’s have a look,” I said as I entered my study.",20,RO005TR06
2321,691,"And I hesitated for a moment, I believe out of shame; I was overtaken once more by apprehensions of a prank. Of course there were no external witnesses; but inside of me I had a boy who was certain to whistle, squeal, grunt, stamp, sneer, cackle, and raise hell if he saw me open up the parcel and find a dozen soiled handkerchiefs or two dozen rotten guavas.1 It was too late; my curiosity had been piqued, as must be the reader’s; I untied the parcel and saw . . . found . . . counted . . . counted again . . . nothing less than five thousand milréis. Nothing less.",20,RO005TR06
2322,692,"Perhaps ten milréis more. Five thousand milréis in fine bills and coins, all clean and neat, an extraordinary find. I tied up the parcel again. At supper, it seemed to me that one of the slave boys had said something to another with his eyes. Might they have spied on me? I interrogated them discreetly and concluded that they had not. Just after supper I went back to my study, examined the money, and laughed at my dispensing maternal cares to five thousand milréis—I, a wealthy man.",20,RO005TR06
2323,693,"To think no more of it, that night I went to the house of Lobo Neves, who had insisted greatly that I continue attending his wife’s social gatherings. There I saw the chief of police, and was introduced to him; at once he recalled the letter and the half-dobra that I had sent him a few days earlier. He recounted the story; Virgília seemed to savor my actions, and each of those present hastened to tell a similar anecdote, which I listened to with all the impatience of a hysterical woman.",20,RO005TR06
2324,694,"That night, the following day, and for the rest of that week, I thought as little as possible about the five thousand milréis, and I will confess that I left them to their own devices in my desk drawer. I would happily speak of anything except money, much less found money; not that it was a crime to find money, it was a boon, good fortune, perhaps an act of Providence. It could be nothing else. One doesn’t lose five thousand milréis the way one loses a snuff handkerchief. One carries five thousand milréis around with thirty thousand senses all alight, feeling them from time to time, never taking one’s eyes off them, nor one’s hands, nor one’s thoughts, and for them to be lost so foolishly, on a beach, there must have been . . .",20,RO005TR06
2325,695,"It couldn’t have been a crime, my find; neither a crime, nor dishonorable, nor anything that might tarnish a man’s character. It was just a find, happy chance, like winning the lottery or a bet on a horse, like the gains of an honest game, and I will go so far as to say that my good fortune was well deserved, for I did not feel myself to be wicked, nor undeserving of the benefits of Providence.",20,RO005TR06
2326,696,"“Those five thousand milréis,” I pondered to myself three weeks later, “I’ll put them to some good end, perhaps as the dowry for a poor girl, or something of the sort . . . I’ll see . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2327,697,"That same day, I took them to the Bank of Brazil. There I was met with many warm allusions to the half-dobra, the news having already spread among those who knew me; I responded vexedly that the incident hardly merited such fanfare; upon which they praised my modesty—and when this exasperated me, they replied that it was simply extraordinary.",20,RO005TR06

2331,701,"Some plants take root and grow quickly; others are slow and stunted. Our love was one of the former; it shot up with such force and sap that it was soon the most colossal, leafy, and exuberant creature in all the forests. I cannot tell you with any certainty how many days it took to grow. I do recall that on a certain night there bloomed a flower, or a kiss, if you wish to call it that, a kiss that she gave me, trembling—poor thing—trembling with fear, since it came by the garden gate.",20,RO005TR06
2332,702,"We were united by that single kiss—brief as the occasion, ardent as our love, the prologue to a life of delights, terrors, remorses, pleasures that came to pain, troubles that blossomed into joy—a patient, systematic hypocrisy, the only check on an unchecked passion—a life of agitation, fury, despair, and jealousy, which a single moment paid for handsomely; but then another moment came and swallowed the first, and all with it, leaving only the agitations and the rest, the remainder of the remainder, which is tedium and satiety: such was the book that followed that prologue.",20,RO005TR06

2335,705,"I left, savoring the kiss. I couldn’t get to sleep that night; I did lie down in bed, but it was as good as nothing. I heard all the hours strike that night. Ordinarily, when I found myself unable to sleep, the sound of the pendulum clock tormented me; that somber, bone-dry, sluggish tick-tock seemed to say with each stroke that I now had one fewer moment of life. Then I would envision an old devil seated between two sacks, one of life and one of death, and taking the coins from life and passing them over to death, counting them out:",20,RO005TR06

2340,710,"The most peculiar thing is that if the clock stopped, I would wind it up, so that it would never stop striking and I could count every one of my lost moments. Some inventions are transformed or fade away; institutions themselves come to grief; but the clock is definitive and everlasting. The last man on earth, as he bids farewell to the cold, sapped sun, will have a watch in his pocket so as to know the exact hour of his death.",20,RO005TR06
2341,711,"On that night I was not visited by that terrible ennui, but by another sensation, a delightful one. Fantasies were aflutter within me, one tumbling after the other, like pious ladies jostling to see the singing angel in a religious procession. I heard not the moments lost, but the minutes gained. At some point hence I heard nothing at all, for my thoughts, cunning and restless as they were, leaped out the window and flew over to Virgília’s house. There they found Virgília’s thoughts on a windowsill, where they greeted one another and struck up a conversation. There we were, tossing and turning in our beds, perhaps feeling cold, deprived of rest, as those two vagabonds echoed the age-old dialogue of Adam and Eve.",20,RO005TR06

2358,728,"And yet—dash it all! Who can explain the reason for this change? One day we saw one another, arranged a marriage, undid it, and separated, coldly, painlessly, for there had been no passion whatsoever; I was stung by some resentment, nothing more. Years pass, I see her again, we waltz three or four times, and here we are, deliriously in love. Virgília’s beauty had reached a great degree of refinement, to be sure, but we were largely the same; and I, for my part, had become neither handsomer nor more elegant. Who can explain the reason for this change?",20,RO005TR06
2359,729,"The reason could be none other than the opportune moment. The first moment had not been opportune; while neither of us was unready for love, we were both unready for our love: a fundamental distinction. There can be no love unless the time is opportune for both parties. I hit upon this explanation myself, two years after the kiss, on a day when Virgília was complaining to me of some dandy who was doggedly courting her.",20,RO005TR06
2360,730,"“How importunate!” she said, scowling.",20,RO005TR06
2361,731,"I started, looked at her, and saw that her indignation was sincere; then it occurred to me that I might have once provoked the same scowl, and I understood then just how great my evolution had been. I had come all the way from importunate to opportune.",20,RO005TR06

2365,735,"Di pari, come buoi, che vanno a giogo2",20,RO005TR06
2366,736,"but I shouldn’t compare us to oxen, for we were another species of animal altogether, less plodding, more shameless and lascivious. There we went, not knowing how far we might go, nor down which devious byways; this problem haunted me for a few weeks, but I left its solution in the hands of fate. Poor Fate!3 Where are you now, great solicitor of human affairs? Perhaps off creating a new skin, another face, other manners, a different name, and perhaps . . .",20,RO005TR06
2367,737,"Now I can’t remember where I was . . . Ah! Down the devious byways. I said to myself that things were in God’s hands. We were meant to love one another; otherwise, how could one explain the waltz and the rest? Virgília thought the same. One day, after confessing to me that she had moments of remorse, and when I said that if she felt remorse, it was because she didn’t love me, Virgília enfolded me in her magnificent arms, murmuring:",20,RO005TR06
2368,738,"“I love you, for Heaven wills it.”",20,RO005TR06
2369,739,"She didn’t say so lightly; Virgília was somewhat religious. She didn’t attend Mass on Sundays, it’s true, and I believe that she went to church only on festival days, or when there was a spare seat in a reserved pew. But she prayed every night, fervently, or at least drowsily. Thunderclaps frightened her; when she heard them, she would cover her ears and mumble all the prayers in the catechism. In her bedroom there was a little altar in carved jacaranda wood, three spans high, with three statues on it; but she never spoke of it to her friends. On the contrary, she called the religious ones sanctimonious. For some time I suspected that she was somewhat ashamed at believing, that her religion was a sort of flannel undershirt, a furtive safeguard; but evidently I was mistaken.",20,RO005TR06

2371,741,TRUST,20,RO005TR06
2372,742,"At first, Lobo Neves frightened me greatly. Pure imagination! He adored his wife, and never tired of telling me so; he thought that Virgília was perfection itself, a combination of fine, staunch qualities, doting, elegant, austere, a paragon. Nor did his trust stop there. It began as a chink and became a wide-open door. One day he confessed to me that he had something eating away at his existence; it was the lack of public glory.",20,RO005TR06
2373,743,"I cheered him; I offered him many a pretty word, which he absorbed with the religious zeal of a desire seeking to rise from its deathbed; then I understood that his ambition was weary of beating its wings without ever taking flight. Some days later, he told me of all his tediums and failings, the gall he had stifled, the rage he had smothered; he said that political life was woven of envies, grudges, intrigues, betrayals, interests, and vanities. Evidently this was a crisis of melancholy; I tried to beat it back.",20,RO005TR06
2374,744,"“I know very well what I’m saying,” he replied sadly. “You can’t imagine what I’ve gone through. I entered politics out of a taste for it, my family, my ambition, and in part out of vanity. As you can see, I have all the motives that lead a man to public life; I only lacked an interest of another nature. I had seen the play from the audience, and by God, it was beautiful! The scenery was magnificent, and there was life, movement, and grace in the acting. I signed on; they gave me a role that . . . But why am I tiring you with this? I’ll keep my troubles to myself. I swear, I’ve spent hours and days . . . There is no constancy, no gratitude, nothing . . . nothing . . . nothing . . .",20,RO005TR06
2375,745,"He fell silent, profoundly despondent, his eyes staring, seeming to hear nothing but the echo of his own thoughts. After a few moments, he rose and held out a hand:",20,RO005TR06
2376,746,"“You’ll surely laugh at me,” he said, “but pardon me for the outburst; I had something eating at my spirit.”",20,RO005TR06
2377,747,"And he laughed, a somber, sad laugh; then he asked me that I not tell anyone what had occurred between us; I argued that nothing, strictly speaking, had occurred. Two deputies and a local political boss came in. Lobo Neves received them with an air of joy that was slightly forced at first, but then became natural. After half an hour’s time, no one would say that he was not the most fortunate of men; he chatted, joked, and laughed, and they all laughed together.",20,RO005TR06

2379,749,AN ENCOUNTER,20,RO005TR06
2380,750,"“Politics must be a restorative wine,” I said to myself as I left Lobo Neves’s house; and I went on walking and walking until, on the Rua dos Barbonos, I saw a carriage, and inside it one of the ministers, an old schoolmate. We greeted one another affectionately, the carriage went on, and I went on walking . . . walking . . . walking . . .",20,RO005TR06
2381,751,“Why can’t I be a minister?”,20,RO005TR06
2382,752,"This idea, resplendent and imposing—clad in bizarre garb, as Father Bernardes might say—this idea began a whirling of somersaults, and I let my eyes rest on it, finding it entertaining. I thought no more of Lobo Neves’s sorrow; I felt the pull of the abyss. I recalled that companion of my school days, of our running up and down the hills, our joys and high jinks, and I compared the boy with the man, and asked myself why I couldn’t be in his place. Then I went into the Passeio Público, and everything in the park seemed to pose the same question:",20,RO005TR06
2383,753,"“Why don’t you become a minister, Cubas?” “Cubas, why don’t you become a minister of state?” Upon hearing this, my being was flooded with a delicious sensation. I went and sat on a bench, mulling over the idea. And then there was Virgília; how she’d like it! A few minutes later I saw a face that was not unfamiliar come over in my direction. I knew it, but I couldn’t recall where I’d seen it.",20,RO005TR06
2384,754,"Imagine a man of between thirty-eight and forty, tall, gaunt, and pale. His clothes, save their style, seemed to have escaped the Babylonian Captivity;2 the hat was a contemporary of Gessler’s.3 Now imagine an overcoat far more capacious than would have been required by the flesh—or, to be literal, the bones—of the person; the black of the garment was giving way to a dull yellow; the nap was gradually vanishing; of the original eight buttons, three were left. The brown canvas trousers had two great holes at the knees, and the hems had been gnawed away by the heels of boots lacking in both pity and polish. At his neck there floated the ends of a cravat of two colors, both faded, tied around a week-old shirt collar. I believe that he was also wearing a dark silk waistcoat, torn here and there and hanging unbuttoned.",20,RO005TR06
2385,755,"“I’ll wager you don’t remember me, Dr. Cubas,” he said.",20,RO005TR06

2387,757,"“I’m Borba, Quincas Borba.”",20,RO005TR06
2388,758,"I shrank back, astonished. Had I only the solemn oratory of Bossuet or Vieira, the better to narrate such desolation! It was Quincas Borba, the charming boy of yesteryear, my school companion, so intelligent and well-to-do. Quincas Borba! No; impossible; it can’t be. I could not believe that this squalid figure, this white-spattered beard, this aged tatterdemalion, this ruin of a man, was Quincas Borba. But it was. His eyes bore a remnant of their old expression, and his smile had not lost a certain distinctive mocking air. All the while, he bore up manfully under my astonishment. After some time, I dragged my gaze away; while the sight repelled me, the comparison grieved me.",20,RO005TR06
2389,759,"“I need not tell you anything,” he said at last. “You’ve guessed it all. A life of misery, tribulations, and struggles. Do you remember how I always played the king? What a fall! I’ve become a beggar . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2390,760,"And, as he raised both his right hand and his shoulders with an air of indifference, he seemed resigned to the blows of fortune, perhaps even content. Certainly impassive. There was no Christian resignation in him, nor philosophical acceptance. It seemed that poverty had hardened his soul so that he could no longer feel the mire. He wore his tatters as he had once worn the royal purple: with a certain indolent grace.",20,RO005TR06
2391,761,"“Come see me,” I said. “I may be able to find something for you.”",20,RO005TR06
2392,762,A magnificent smile came across his lips.,20,RO005TR06
2393,763,"“You’re not the first to promise me something,” he replied, “and you may not be the last who will do nothing for me. And why would you? I want nothing of you but money; money, yes, because I must eat, and taverns give no credit. Nor do the peddlers. A scrap, two pennies’ worth of porridge, the damned peddlers won’t even give credit for that. It’s hell, my . . . I was about to say ‘my friend’ . . . Hell! Devil take it! All the devils!

2396,766,"I took out my wallet, chose a five-milréis bill6—the least clean of the lot—and gave it to him. He took it from me, eyes glittering with greed, and raised the bill into the air, brandishing it with glee.",20,RO005TR06
2397,767,“In hoc signo vinces!” he cried out.,20,RO005TR06
2398,768,"Then he kissed it with many a tender gesture, and with such noisy affection that I felt something between disgust and pity. He was clever, and understood my reaction; he grew serious, grotesquely so, and begged my pardon for his joy, saying that it was the joy of a poor man who had not seen a five-milréis bill in many years.",20,RO005TR06

Now my pity had given way to disgust. I wished he had been dignified in his poverty. And yet I couldn’t help comparing the man of today to the figure of yesteryear, growing sad, and contemplating the abyss that separates the hopes of one time from the reality of another . . .",20,RO005TR06

2421,791,"I had a melancholy supper. It was not the loss of the pocket watch that pained me, but the image of he who had stolen it, and the memories of childhood, and once again the comparison, and the conclusion . . . Starting at the soup course, the yellow and morbid flower from Chapter XXV began to bloom within me, and I dined quickly so as to run to Virgília’s house. Virgília was the present, and I wanted to take refuge in it to escape the oppressions of the past; the encounter with Quincas Borba had turned my gaze to the past, not as it had been, but a tattered, abject, beggarly, thieving past.",20,RO005TR06
2422,792,"I left home, but it was still early; I would find them at the supper table. I thought again of Quincas Borba, and then I felt a desire to return to the Passeio Público in hopes of finding him; the idea of rehabilitating him swelled into a powerful need. I went, but didn’t find him. I asked the guard, who told me that, indeed, “that fellow” came around sometimes.",20,RO005TR06

And, all things considered, there was no other reason for Virgília’s existence; there could be no other.",20,RO005TR06

2433,803,"“I believe Damião suspects something. I’ve noticed some strange signs in him . . . I don’t know. He treats me well, to be sure; but it seems his gaze is no longer the same.

2434,804,"I calmed her as best I could; I said that it might be political worries. Virgília agreed, but remained quite excitable and agitated. We were in the drawing room, which looked out onto the grounds where we had exchanged our first kiss. An open window let in the breeze, making the curtains sway gently; I stared at the curtains without seeing them. I had taken up the binoculars of imagination; I could glimpse, off in the distance, a house of our own, a life of our own, a world of our own, in which there was no Lobo Neves, no marriage, no morality, nor any other bond that might hinder the free expansion of our will. This idea intoxicated me; with the world, morality, and the husband eliminated, all that was left was to enter that angelic abode.",20,RO005TR06

With her arms round my neck, quiet and breathing heavily, she gazed upon me with her large, beautiful eyes, which conferred a singular sensation of dewy light; I let myself simply behold them, coveting her mouth, fresh as dawn and as insatiable as death. Virgília’s beauty now bore a glorious air that it had not possessed before marriage.",20,RO005TR06
2440,810,"She was like a figure carved in Pentelic marble, finely made, open and pure; she had the tranquil beauty of a statue, but was neither indifferent nor cold. On the contrary, she seemed possessed of an ardent nature, and one might say that, in truth, she epitomized love itself. This was particularly true on that occasion, in which she mutely expressed everything that a human pupil is capable of conveying. But time was pressing; I unclasped her hands, took her by the wrists, and, with my gaze fixed on her, I asked if she had the courage.",20,RO005TR06

2461,831,"“You’ll dine with us, good sir,” said Lobo Neves.",20,RO005TR06
2462,832,"“That’s just why he came,” confirmed his wife; “he says you have the best wine in Rio de Janeiro.”",20,RO005TR06
2463,833,“And yet he barely drinks.”,20,RO005TR06
2464,834,"At supper, I proved him wrong; I drank more than I was wont to, and yet less than would have deprived me of my senses. I was already agitated, and became a bit more so. This was the first time I had felt furious at Virgília. I didn’t look at her once during supper; I spoke of politics, the press, the administration, and I believe I would have spoken of theology if I had known or remembered anything on the subject. Lobo Neves followed along with me, ever placid and dignified, with an air of superior benevolence; and all of that irritated me as well, and made the supper even bitterer and longer for me. I bade them good night as soon as we had risen from the table.",20,RO005TR06
2465,835,"“We’ll see you shortly, won’t we?” asked Lobo Neves.",20,RO005TR06

2469,839,THE TRANSACTION,20,RO005TR06
2470,840,"I wandered through the streets and retired at nine o’clock. Unable to sleep, I took to reading and writing. By eleven I regretted not having gone to the theater, looked at the clock, and felt moved to dress myself and go out. I realized, however, that I would arrive too late; moreover, it would be a sign of weakness. Evidently Virgília was beginning to tire of me, I thought. And this idea made me alternately despairing and cold, ready to forget her and kill her.",20,RO005TR06
2471,841,"I could see her there, reclining in the box, her magnificent arms bare—the arms that were mine, and mine alone—and transfixing the eyes of all, with the sumptuous dress she was bound to be wearing, her milky bosom, her hair parted in the fashion of the day, and her jewels, less luminous than her eyes . . . I saw her so, and it pained me that others should as well. Then I began to undress her, setting aside her jewels and silks, tousling her hair with my eager, wanton hands, and leaving her—if not more beautiful, if not more natural—leaving her mine, mine alone, only mine.",20,RO005TR06
2472,842,"The next day, I couldn’t contain myself; I went early to Virgília’s house, and found her eyes red from crying.",20,RO005TR06
2473,843,“What happened?” I asked.,20,RO005TR06
2474,844,"“You don’t love me,” was her reply, “and you never had the slightest bit of love for me. You treated me yesterday as if you hated me. If I only knew what it was that I did! But I don’t. Won’t you tell me?”",20,RO005TR06
2475,845,“What? I don’t believe you did a thing.”,20,RO005TR06
2476,846,“Not a thing? You treated me worse than you’d treat a dog . . .”,20,RO005TR06
2477,847,"At these words, I seized her hands and kissed them, and two tears sprang from her eyes.",20,RO005TR06
2478,848,"“It’s all over, it’s all over,” I said.",20,RO005TR06
2479,849,"I hadn’t the heart to accuse her—and, for that matter, accuse her of what? It wasn’t her fault if her husband loved her. I said to her that she hadn’t done anything to me, that I was bound to be jealous of the other man and that I couldn’t always bear it smilingly; I added that he might be hiding his true feelings, and that the best way to put an end to our fears and squabbles was to accept my idea from the day before.",20,RO005TR06
2480,850,"“I’ve thought about it,” Virgília said readily, “a little house just for us, out of the way, tucked away in a garden on some hidden street, isn’t that it? The idea is a good one; but why run away?”",20,RO005TR06
2481,851,"She said this with the naive, casual tone of one who means no evil, and the smile that bent the corners of her mouth bore the same frank expression. At this, drawing back, I responded:",20,RO005TR06
2482,852,“You’ve never loved me.”,20,RO005TR06
2483,853,“I?”,20,RO005TR06
2484,854,"“You’re selfish, that’s what you are! You’d prefer to see me suffer every single day . . . you’re unspeakably selfish!”",20,RO005TR06
2485,855,"Virgília burst out crying; so as not to attract attention, she bit her handkerchief to stifle her sobs, in an explosion that disconcerted me. If anyone heard her, all would be lost. I leaned toward her, took hold of her wrists, and whispered our sweetest pet names; I reminded her of the danger we were in, and fear calmed her.",20,RO005TR06
2486,856,"“I can’t,” she said after a few moments, “I won’t leave my son; if I take him, I’m sure that he will seek me out at the ends of the earth. I can’t; kill me yourself, if you want, or let me die . . . Oh God! God!”",20,RO005TR06
2487,857,“Calm down; they might hear you.”,20,RO005TR06
2488,858,“Let them hear! I don’t care.”,20,RO005TR06
2489,859,"She was still agitated; I begged her to forget everything, forgive me, saying that I had lost my mind, but that my insanity began with her and would end with her. Virgília dried her eyes and held out her hand. We both smiled; minutes later, we returned to the topic of the solitary little house, on some out-of-the-way street . . .",20,RO005TR06

2491,861,EYES AND EARS,20,RO005TR06
2492,862,We were interrupted by the sound of a coach on the grounds. A slave came to say that it was Baroness X. Virgília consulted me with her eyes.,20,RO005TR06
2493,863,"“If you’ve got such a terrible headache,” I said, “it would seem best not to receive her.”",20,RO005TR06
2494,864,“Has she already gotten out?” Virgília asked the slave.,20,RO005TR06
2495,865,"“Yes, and she says she needs to speak to Missus right away!”",20,RO005TR06
2496,866,"“Well, let her in.”",20,RO005TR06
2497,867,The baroness came in shortly. I don’t know if she expected to find me in the drawing room; but it would be impossible to have made a greater fuss.,20,RO005TR06
2498,868,"“A sight for sore eyes!” she exclaimed. “Where have you been hiding? Why, just last night I was surprised not to see you at the theater. Candiani was delightful. What a woman! Do you like her? Of course you do. You men are all the same. The baron was just saying last night in our box that one Italian woman is worth five Brazilians. What cheek! And from an old man, which is worse. But why weren’t you there last night?”",20,RO005TR06
2499,869,“A headache.”,20,RO005TR06
2500,870,"“Nonsense! Some rendezvous; don’t you think, Virgília? Well, hurry up, my friend, because you must be forty . . . or near that . . . Aren’t you forty?”",20,RO005TR06
2501,871,"“I can’t say for certain,” I responded, “but if you’ll allow me, I’ll go consult my baptismal certificate.”",20,RO005TR06
2502,872,"“Go on . . .” she said, holding out a hand. “When shall we see you? On Saturday we’ll be in; the baron has missed you so . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2503,873,"As I stepped out onto the street, I regretted having left. The baroness was one of the people who most suspected us. She was fifty-five but looked forty, with a soft figure, an easy smile, vestiges of beauty, an elegant bearing, and fine manners. She didn’t speak often, nor did she say very much at all. She possessed that great talent for listening to others, keeping watch over them; she would recline in her chair, unsheathe a long, sharpened gaze, and let herself be.",20,RO005TR06
2504,874,"Others, not knowing what she was, would speak, look, and gesticulate, and all the while she would simply watch, motionless at times, lively at others, guileful enough as to cast her eyes down and let her lids fall; but with her eyelashes as a lattice, the gaze kept up its work, raking through the souls and lives of others.",20,RO005TR06
2505,875,"The second person was a relative of Virgília’s, Viegas, a withered, yellow relic some seventy winters old who suffered from a stubborn rheumatism, a no less stubborn asthma, and a damaged heart; he was a walking infirmary. His eyes, however, radiated life and health. During the first weeks, Virgília had no fear of him; she said that when Viegas seemed to fix a person with a prying gaze, he was just counting money to himself. Indeed, he was a great miser.",20,RO005TR06
2506,876,"And then there was Virgília’s cousin, Luís Dutra, whom I now took to disarming by way of speaking of his verses and prose and introducing him to those in my circle. When they, connecting the name to the person, were visibly glad to have met him, Luís Dutra clearly thrilled with happiness; but I cured myself of his happiness with the hope that he would never expose us. Finally, there were two or three ladies, several dandies, and the help, who naturally avenged themselves of their servile condition by keeping close watch over us, and all this constituted a veritable forest of eyes and ears, among which we had to glide as strategically and softly as snakes.",20,RO005TR06

2509,879,"Now, as I contemplated those people, my legs carried me down the streets, and before I knew it I found myself at the door of the Hotel Pharoux. I ordinarily dined there; but, not having walked deliberately, I can take no credit for the act, and all must go to the legs that executed it. Blessed legs! And to think that some treat you with disdain or indifference. I myself had thought ill of you until then and would become cross when you tired or when you could go no farther, leaving me longing to flutter off, like a chicken tied by its feet.",20,RO005TR06
2510,880,"This incident, however, was an illumination. Yes, dear legs, you left to my head the task of thinking about Virgília, and said to one another: “He needs to eat, it’s suppertime, let’s take him to the Pharoux; let’s divide up his conscience, leave a part with the lady, and we will take the rest, so that he can walk in a straight line, not crash into people and carts, tip his hat to acquaintances, and make it to the hotel safe and sound.” And you fulfilled your aim to perfection, kind legs, obliging me to immortalize you on this page.",20,RO005TR06

2512,882,THE LITTLE HOUSE,20,RO005TR06
2513,883,"I dined and went home. There I found a box of cigars from Lobo Neves, wrapped in tissue paper and tied with pink ribbons. I understood, opened up the box, and took out this note:",20,RO005TR06
2514,884,My B . . .,20,RO005TR06
2515,885,They suspect us; all is lost; forget me forever. We will never see one another again. Farewell; think no more of poor,20,RO005TR06
2516,886,V . . . a,20,RO005TR06
2517,887,"The letter was a blow; and yet as soon as night fell, I ran to Virgília’s house. Just in time; she had changed her mind. Through an open window, she told me what had happened with the baroness. The woman had told her frankly that my absence from Lobo Neves’s box had been the subject of much comment at the theater the night before; people had spoken of my relations with their house; in short, we had come under public suspicion. She concluded by saying that she didn’t know what to do.",20,RO005TR06
2518,888,"“The thing for us to do is run away,” I suggested.",20,RO005TR06
2519,889,"“Never,” she replied, shaking her head.",20,RO005TR06
2520,890,"I saw that it would be impossible to separate two things that were entirely connected in her soul: our love and public esteem. Virgília was capable of great and equal sacrifices to preserve both advantages, and running away left her with only one. I may have felt something similar to resentment; but the commotions of those two days had been considerable, and the resentment was quick to die. Well, then, let’s see to the little house.",20,RO005TR06
2521,891,"Indeed, I found it just days later, made to order in a corner of Gamboa. A gem! New, freshly whitewashed, with four windows in front and two on each side, brick-red shutters, creepers climbing up the corners, a garden out front; mystery and solitude. A gem!",20,RO005TR06
2522,892,"We agreed that a woman whom Virgília knew would live there, one who had been a seamstress and dependent in her house, and over whom Virgília exerted a genuine fascination. She would not be told of everything; she could easily accept the rest.",20,RO005TR06
2523,893,"For me, this was a new state of affairs for our love, one with all the trappings of exclusive ownership and absolute dominion, something that might lull my conscience and preserve decorum. I had grown tired of the other man’s curtains, his chairs, his carpet, his couch, all those things that constantly reminded me of our duplicity. Now I could avoid the frequent suppers, the evening teas, and the presence of their son, my accomplice and my enemy.",20,RO005TR06
2524,894,"The house rescued me from all that; the ordinary world ceased at the door; inside was infinity, an eternal, superior, exceptional world, ours and ours alone, without laws, institutions, baronesses, eyes, or ears—one world, one couple, one life, one desire, one affection—the moral unity of all things, by way of the exclusion of all those which went against me.",20,RO005TR06

2526,896,THE WHIP,20,RO005TR06
2527,897,"Such were my reflections as I strolled through Valongo,1 just having visited the house and made the necessary arrangements. My reflections were interrupted by a throng; a negro was whipping another in the square. The other did not dare flee; he simply moaned these words: “No, forgive me, master; master, forgive me!” But the first paid no mind, and at each plea he responded with a new lash of the whip.",20,RO005TR06
2528,898,"“Here, you devil!” he said. “Here’s your forgiveness, you drunk!”",20,RO005TR06
2529,899,“Master!” moaned the other.,20,RO005TR06
2530,900,"“Shut your mouth, beast!” retorted the whipper.",20,RO005TR06
2531,901,"I stopped and looked . . . Gracious heavens! Who was the one with the whip? None other than my slave boy Prudêncio, whom my father had freed some years earlier. I went over; he stopped right away and kissed my hand; I asked if the negro was his slave.",20,RO005TR06
2532,902,"“Yes, master.”",20,RO005TR06
2533,903,“Has he done anything to you?”,20,RO005TR06
2534,904,"“He’s an idler and a drunkard. Today I left him at the stall while I went into town, and he went off to go drink.”",20,RO005TR06
2535,905,"“Well, forgive him, go on,” I said.",20,RO005TR06
2536,906,"“Of course, master. Master’s word is an order. Get on home, you drunk!”",20,RO005TR06
2537,907,"I left the crowd, which looked at me in astonishment and muttered conjectures. I went on my way, unfurling countless reflections, which I’m afraid I have forgotten entirely; they would have made for a good chapter, perhaps a cheerful one. I like cheerful chapters; I have a weakness for them. On the outside, the Valongo incident was dreadful; but only on the outside. As soon as I slid the knife of reasoning farther in, I found a marrow that was mischievous, refined, even profound. This was Prudêncio’s way of freeing himself from the blows he had received—by passing them on to another.",20,RO005TR06
2538,908,"I, as a child, had ridden on him, put a bit in his mouth, and thrashed him mercilessly as he groaned and suffered. Now that he was free, however, the master of his own arms and legs, able to work, rest, and sleep, unshackled from his former condition, now he had surpassed himself: he had bought a slave and was paying back, with steep interest, the sums he had received from me. See how clever the rascal was!",20,RO005TR06

2542,912,"“I am the great Tamerlane,” he would say. “Once I was Romualdo, but I fell ill and took so much tartar, so much tartar, so much tartar, that I became a Tartar, and then the king of the Tartars. Tartar has the virtue of making Tartars.”",20,RO005TR06
2543,913,"Poor Romualdo! People laughed at his reply, but the reader is likely not to, and rightly so; I don’t find it funny in the slightest. When heard, it had some wit to it; but written out on paper, and on the score of a lashing received and transferred, one must admit that it is far better to return to the little house in Gamboa; let us leave the Romualdos and Prudêncios aside.",20,RO005TR06

2545,915,DONA PLÁCIDA,20,RO005TR06
2546,916,"Let us return to the little house. You wouldn’t be able to enter it today, curious reader; it grew old, and begrimed, and was left to rot, and the owner knocked it down to replace it with another, three times its size—but I swear to you that it is far smaller than the original. The world was too narrow for Alexander; a hollow under the eaves is boundless for a swallow.",20,RO005TR06
2547,917,"Behold the neutrality of this globe, which carries us through space like a boat of castaways heading for shore: today a virtuous couple sleeps on the same bit of ground that once suffered a sinning couple. Tomorrow a clergyman may sleep there, then a murderer, then a blacksmith, then a poet, and all will bless that corner of the earth, which gave them a few fleeting dreams.",20,RO005TR06
2548,918,"Virgília made the place a delight; she chose the most fitting furnishings and arranged them with her elegant lady’s eye; I brought over a few books, and everything was left to the cares of Dona Plácida, the ostensible and, in some respects, the true lady of the house.",20,RO005TR06
2549,919,"She struggled greatly to accept the house; she had sniffed out its purpose, and the charge pained her; but at last she gave in. I believe she wept, at first: she was disgusted with herself. At least she didn’t raise her eyes to me during the first two months; she looked down when she spoke to me, seeming serious and sullen, and at times sad. I wanted to win her over, and so I took no offense; I treated her with care and respect and strove to obtain her benevolence, and then her trust.",20,RO005TR06
2550,920,"Once I had obtained her trust, I imagined up a heartrending story of my and Virgília’s love, a courtship before her marriage, how her father had resisted, how harsh her husband was, and other novelistic touches. Dona Plácida did not spurn a single page of the novelette; she accepted them all. Her conscience demanded it. After six months’ time, anyone seeing the three of us together would have said that Dona Plácida was my mother-in-law.",20,RO005TR06
2551,921,I was not ungrateful; I made her a gift of five thousand milréis—the five thousand I had found in Botafogo—as a sum for her old age. Dona Plácida thanked me with tears in her eyes and never failed to pray for me every night before a statue of the Virgin in her bedroom. That was how her disgust died away.,20,RO005TR06

2553,923,THE FLAW IN THE BOOK,20,RO005TR06
2554,924,"I am beginning to regret that I ever took to writing this book. Not that it tires me; I have nothing else to do, and dispatching a few meager chapters into the other world is invariably a bit of a distraction from eternity. But the book is tedious, it reeks of the grave, it bears a cadaveric grimace; this is a grave defect, and yet a minor one on the whole, for this book’s greatest flaw is you, reader. You are in a hurry to grow old, and the book moves slowly; you love direct, robust narration and a smooth and regular style, and this book and my style are like drunkards, they veer right and left, stop and go, grumble, bellow, cackle, threaten the skies, slip, and fall . . .",20,RO005TR06
2555,925,"And they fall! Wretched leaves of my cypress tree, you, too, must fall, like all others so beautiful and splendid; and, had I eyes, I would shed a tear of remembrance for you.

2559,929,"Look: seventy years from now, a scrawny, sallow, gray-headed fellow who loves nothing but books will lean over the previous page to see if he can find the nonsense; he reads it, rereads it, threereads it, disjoints the words, takes out one syllable, then another, yet another and the rest, examines them inside and out, from all sides, against the light, dusts them off, wipes them on his knee, washes them, and to no avail; he cannot find the nonsense.",20,RO005TR06
2560,930,"He is a bibliomaniac. He hasn’t heard of the author; this name Brás Cubas is nowhere to be found in his biographical dictionaries. He found the volume by chance in a filthy, run-down secondhand bookstore and bought it for just two hundred réis. He inquired, investigated, rummaged around, and came to find that it was the only copy in existence . . . the only copy! Thou who not only lovest books, but also sufferest from a mania for them, thou knowest full well the weight of the word, and may thus envisage the delight of my bibliomaniac. He would spurn the crown of the Indies, the papacy, all the museums of Italy and Holland, if he had to give over this single volume in exchange; and not because it was a copy of my Memoirs; he would do the same for Laemmert’s Almanack, were there only one copy of it.",20,RO005TR06
2561,931,"It’s a pity about the nonsense. The man is still leaning over the page with a glass in his right eye, entirely devoted to the noble and grim undertaking of deciphering the nonsensical element. He has promised himself that he will write a brief article in which he recounts finding the book and discovering the sublime meaning, if there is any, behind that obscure phrase. In the end he discovers nothing of the sort and contents himself with possession. He closes the book, examines it, reexamines it, goes over to the window, and shows it to the sun. The only copy! Just then, a Caesar or a Cromwell passes by beneath his window, on the road to power. He shrugs, closes the window, stretches out in his hammock, and leafs through the book slowly, lovingly, sip by sip . . . The only copy!",20,RO005TR06

2564,934,"The nonsense has made me waste another chapter. How much better it would be to say things smoothly, without all this jolting! I’ve already compared my style to a drunkard’s walk. If the idea strikes you as indecorous, I will say that it was precisely what my meals with Virgília were at the little house in Gamboa, where we often had our feasts, our refreshments. Wine, fruit, compotes. We ate, it’s true, but the eating was punctuated with the commas of sweet words, tender gazes, childish moments, an endless stream of these asides of the heart which are the true, uninterrupted discourse of love.",20,RO005TR06
2565,935,"At times a lover’s quarrel would come to temper the surfeit of sweetness. She would leave me and take refuge in a corner of the sofa, or go inside to hear Dona Plácida’s cooing. Five or ten minutes later, we would resume the thread of our conversation again, as I resume the thread of narration, only to abandon it yet again. Note that not only did we not flee from method, we also habitually invited it, in the form of Dona Plácida, to join us at the table; but Dona Plácida never said yes.",20,RO005TR06

2571,941,"Never regret your generosity; the silver coin won me Dona Plácida’s trust, and hence this chapter. Days later, when I found her alone in the house, we struck up a conversation and she told me her story in a few words. She was the illegitimate child of a sacristan at the See and a woman who made sweets from her home. She had lost her father at age ten. By then she had already been set to grating coconut and whatever other sweetmaker’s tasks were compatible with her age.",20,RO005TR06
2572,942,"At fifteen or sixteen she married a tailor who died of consumption some time later, leaving her with a daughter. A young widow, she was left with her daughter, then age two, and her mother, exhausted from a lifetime of work. She had to support the three of them. She made sweets, which was her profession, but she also sewed doggedly, day and night, for three or four shops, and taught some children in the neighborhood for a few coins a month. The years slipped away, but not her beauty, for she had never had any to begin with. A few courtships, proposals, and seductions presented themselves, but she resisted them all.",20,RO005TR06
2573,943,"“If I could’ve found another husband,” she told me, “I would have married, believe me; but nobody wanted to marry me.”",20,RO005TR06
2574,944,"One of the suitors managed to win acceptance; but since he proved no nobler than the rest, Dona Plácida sent him away in turn, and, having done so, wept a great deal. She continued sewing and keeping the sugar pots at a boil. Her mother was surly by virtue of temperament, age, and want; she bedeviled her daughter to accept one of the proposals put to her by borrowed husbands or chance lovers. And she would bawl:",20,RO005TR06
2575,945,"“D’you want to be better than me? I don’t know where you got these rich lady’s airs. Life won’t just see to itself, my dear, we can’t eat air. Bah! Fellows as fine as Policarpo from the shop . . . You’re waiting for some nobleman, aren’t you?”",20,RO005TR06
2576,946,"Dona Plácida swore to me that she wasn’t waiting for a nobleman. It was her temperament. She wanted to be married. She knew very well that her mother had never married, and knew a few women who had simply taken up with their fellows; but her temperament demanded that she be married. Nor did she want anything else for her daughter. She worked hard, burning her fingers on the stove and her eyes at the lamp, to be able to eat and keep her footing. She grew thin, fell ill, lost her mother, buried her with the help of charity, and continued to work. Her daughter was fourteen; but she was a feeble little thing and did nothing but flirt with the ne’er-do-wells who hung around her window. Dona Plácida took exceptional care, bringing the girl along with her when she went to deliver her sewing. People in the shops stared and winked, convinced that she was looking to find a husband for the girl, or something else entirely. Some cracked jokes or accosted her; the mother even received offers of money . . .",20,RO005TR06
2577,947,"She broke off for a moment, and then went on:",20,RO005TR06
2578,948,"“My daughter ran away; she went off with some man, and I’ll hear no more of it . . . She left me alone, and so awful sad I thought of dying. I had nobody else in the world, and I was nearly an old woman, and sickly. It was around then that I met Missus’s family: good folk, who kept me busy and even took me in. I was there for many months, a year, more than a year, under their protection, sewing. I left when Missus got married. Then I lived at God’s mercy. Look at my fingers, look at these hands . . .” And she showed me her callused, creviced hands, her needle-pricked fingers. “These aren’t made by chance, sir; God knows they aren’t . . . Thank goodness Missus took me in, and you, too, sir . . . I was afraid I might end up on the streets, begging . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2579,949,"As she let out these last words, Dona Plácida shivered. Then, as if coming to her senses, she seemed to realize how unseemly it was to make such a confession to the lover of a married woman and began to laugh, go back on what she’d said, calling herself a fool, “full of airs,” as her mother said; finally, tiring of my silence, she withdrew from the room. I was left staring at the tip of my boot.",20,RO005TR06

2582,952,"As some of my readers may have skipped the previous chapter, I will observe that it must be read in order to understand what I said to myself just after Dona Plácida had left the room. What I said was this:",20,RO005TR06
2583,953,"“And so the sacristan at the See, helping to say Mass one day, saw the lady come in who was to be his collaborator in creating Dona Plácida. He saw her on other days, for weeks on end, liked what he saw, and made some winning remark or nudged her foot as he was lighting the altars on feast days. She took a liking to him, they grew closer, and they loved one another. Of this conjunction of idle lustings, there sprouted Dona Plácida. One assumes that Dona Plácida did not yet speak when she was born, but if she could, she might have said to the authors of her days:",20,RO005TR06
2584,954,"‘Here I am. Why have you called me?’ And the sacristan and the sacristine would naturally reply: ‘We called you to burn your fingers on pots and your eyes at sewing, to eat poorly or not at all, to plod up and down in endless drudgery, ailing and mending, only to ail and mend once again, now sorrowful, soon desperate, tomorrow resigned, but always with your hands at the pot and your eyes on your sewing, until you end your days in the gutter or in the hospital; this is why we called you, in a moment of good feeling.’”",20,RO005TR06

2586,956,MANURE,20,RO005TR06
2587,957,"My conscience suddenly twitched and accused me of having forced Dona Plácida’s integrity to give in, obliging her to take on a shameful role after a long life of work and want. A go-between was no better than a concubine, and I had lowered her to this profession by means of favors and monies. That was what my conscience said; for ten minutes, I could find no reply. It added that I had taken advantage of Virgília’s influence over the ex-seamstress, the woman’s gratitude, and her need. It noted Dona Plácida’s resistance, her tears in the early days, her scowls, her silences, her lowered eyes, and how I skillfully bore up under it all until I won her over. And it tugged at me again, seeming irritated and agitated.",20,RO005TR06
2588,958,"I agreed that this was so, but I alleged that Dona Plácida was now safe from beggary in her old age, and that this was ample compensation. Were it not for my love, she would probably share the fate of so many other human creatures; from which one may deduce that vice is quite often the manure for virtue. None of which prevents virtue from being a fragrant, healthy flower. My conscience agreed, and I went to open the door for Virgília.",20,RO005TR06

2590,960,RENDEZVOUS,20,RO005TR06
2591,961,"Virgília entered, smiling and at ease. Time had carried away our frights and mortifications. How sweet it had been to see her arrive during those first days, trembling and ashamed! She would come in a coach, her face veiled, wrapped in a sort of manteau that concealed her undulating figure. The first time, she collapsed onto the sofa, breathless, scarlet, her eyes on the floor; and—I swear to you!—on no other occasion had I found her so beautiful, perhaps because I had never felt more flattered.",20,RO005TR06
2592,962,"Now, however, as I was saying, the frights and mortifications had ended; we saw each other with chronometric regularity. The intensity of our love was the same; the difference was that the flame had lost the furor of the first days to become a simple radiant beam, calm and constant, as in marriages.",20,RO005TR06
2593,963,"“I’m quite cross with you,” she said as she sat down.",20,RO005TR06
2594,964,“Why?”,20,RO005TR06
2595,965,"“Because you didn’t come yesterday, as you’d said you would. Damião asked several times if you wouldn’t at least come for tea. Why didn’t you?”",20,RO005TR06
2596,966,"Indeed, I had broken my promise, and it was all Virgília’s fault. A matter of jealousy. That splendid woman knew perfectly well that it was, but she liked to hear it said, whether shouted or in a murmur. Two evenings earlier at the baroness’s house, she had waltzed twice with the same dandy after having listened to his affected courtesies over by a window. She was so joyful! So expansive! So self-assured! When she spied an interrogative and threatening wrinkle between my eyebrows, she was not startled, nor did she grow suddenly serious; but she threw the dandy and his affected courtesies overboard. She came over to me, took my arm, and guided me to another, less populated room, where she complained of fatigue and said many other things with the childish air that she normally had on such occasions, as I listened while making almost no reply.",20,RO005TR06
2597,967,"Even now it was a struggle to reply at all, but I finally told her of the reason for my absence at tea . . . No, eternal stars, I never saw eyes more astonished. Her mouth half-open, her eyebrows arched, a visible, tangible, undeniable stupefaction: this was Virgília’s first rebuttal. She shook her head with a pitying, tender smile that confounded me entirely.",20,RO005TR06
2598,968,"“Oh, you!”",20,RO005TR06
2599,969,"And she went to take off her hat, lively and good-humored as a girl coming back from school; then she came over to where I was seated and tapped me on the forehead with a finger, saying: “You, you, you”; until I had no remedy but to laugh as well, and it all ended in fun. It was clear I’d been deceived.1",20,RO005TR06

2601,971,THE PRESIDENCY,20,RO005TR06
2602,972,"One day, months later, Lobo Neves came home saying that he might take on the presidency of a province.1 I looked at Virgília, who went pale; he, seeing her pale, asked:",20,RO005TR06
2603,973,"“I gather you aren’t pleased, Virgília?”",20,RO005TR06
2604,974,Virgília shook her head.,20,RO005TR06
2605,975,"“It’s not much to my liking,” was her answer.",20,RO005TR06
2606,976,Nothing more was said; but at night Lobo Neves made the case for the plan a bit more resolutely than he had that afternoon; two days later he declared to his wife that the presidency was a fait accompli. Virgília was unable to disguise her distaste of it. Her husband’s answer to everything was “political necessity.”,20,RO005TR06
2607,977,"“I can’t refuse their requests; and it’s good for us, our future, your titles, my love. I promised that I’d make you a marchioness, and you’re not even a baroness yet. You may call me ambitious, and truly I am, but you mustn’t weigh down the wings of my ambition.”",20,RO005TR06
2608,978,"Virgília was disoriented. On the following day I found her at the Gamboa house, sorrowfully awaiting me; she had told everything to Dona Plácida, who consoled her as best she could. I was no less stricken.",20,RO005TR06
2609,979,"“You must go with us,” Virgília said.",20,RO005TR06

2615,985,“I believe so.”,20,RO005TR06
2616,986,"I rose, threw my hat onto a chair, and began pacing up and down, unsure as to what I would do. I cogitated at length and hit upon nothing. Finally I went to Virgília, who was sitting down, and took her hand; Dona Plácida went over to the window.",20,RO005TR06
2617,987,"“In this little hand lies the whole of my existence,” I said. “You are responsible for it; do with it what you may.”",20,RO005TR06
2618,988,"Virgília made a distressing face; and I went to lean on the console table opposite her. A few moments of silence followed; all we heard was the barking of a dog and perhaps the murmur of waves breaking on the beach. She said nothing, and so I looked at her. Virgília had her eyes on the floor, immobile and dull, her clasped hands resting on her lap in an attitude of supreme despair.",20,RO005TR06
2619,989,"Were it another occasion, were it a different reason, I would certainly fall at her feet and comfort her with all my reason and tenderness; now, however, she had to be compelled to act for herself, to make sacrifices, to attend to the responsibility of the life we shared, and hence I had to forsake her, leave her, and go off; which was what I did.",20,RO005TR06
2620,990,"“I repeat, my happiness is in your hands,” I said.",20,RO005TR06
2621,991,"Virgília moved to hold me back, but I was already out the door. I heard a burst of weeping, and I tell you that I was on the verge of going back to dry the tears with a kiss; but I mastered myself and left.",20,RO005TR06

2623,993,COMPROMISE,20,RO005TR06
2624,994,"If I were to recount in minute detail what I suffered in those first hours, I should never finish. I wavered between wanting and not wanting, between the pity thrusting me toward Virgília’s house and another sentiment—selfishness, let’s say—which said: “Stay where you are; leave her alone with the problem, and she’ll decide on the side of love.” I believe that these two forces were equally powerful, assailing and resisting at the same time, ardent and tenacious, and neither would give way entirely.",20,RO005TR06
2625,995,"At times I felt a pang of remorse; it seemed that I was taking advantage of the weakness of a woman in love and in the wrong, while I neither sacrificed nor risked anything of my own; but just as I was about to capitulate, love would come again, repeating its selfish counsel, and I was left irresolute and restless, yearning to see her and fearing that the sight of her might lead me to share the responsibility for the solution.",20,RO005TR06
2626,996,"Finally, there came a compromise between selfishness and pity; I would go see her at her home, only there, in the presence of her husband, say nothing to her, and await the effect of my intimation. That way I could reconcile the two forces. Now that I write this, it strikes me that the compromise was a farce, that the pity was still a form of selfishness, and that the decision to go console Virgília was merely prompted by my own suffering.1",20,RO005TR06

2628,998,AS A SECRETARY,20,RO005TR06
2629,999,"On the following night, I did go to Lobo Neves’s house; both were there, Virgília quite downcast, he quite jovial. I could swear that she felt a measure of relief when our eyes met, full of curiosity and tenderness. Lobo Neves told me of his plans for the presidency, the local difficulties, his hopes, his resolutions; he was so content! So confident! Sitting by the table, Virgília made as if to read a book, but looked at me over the page from time to time, inquisitive and anxious.",20,RO005TR06
2630,1000,"“The trouble,” Lobo Neves said suddenly, “is that I still haven’t found a secretary.”",20,RO005TR06
2631,1001,“No?”,20,RO005TR06

2635,1005,I don’t know what I said to him.,20,RO005TR06
2636,1006,"“You’re wealthy,” he went on, “and you have no need of the meager salary; but if you wished to oblige me, you might go with me as a secretary.”",20,RO005TR06
2637,1007,"My spirit leaped back as if it had spotted a snake. I looked hard at Lobo Neves to see if I could make out any hidden reflection . . . Not a shadow; his gaze was direct and frank, his features naturally serene and peaceable, a serenity dotted with satisfaction. I took a breath, but couldn’t bring myself to look at Virgília; I felt her gaze over the book, asking me the same question, and I said yes, I would go. Indeed, to have a president, a presidentess, and a secretary was a fine administrative solution.",20,RO005TR06

2639,1009,RECONCILIATION,20,RO005TR06
2640,1010,"As I left, however, I felt a shadow of doubt; I pondered if it wouldn’t mean foolishly risking Virgília’s reputation, if there wasn’t another reasonable way to square the government with Gamboa. I could find none. The next day, when I rose from bed, I had made up my mind to accept the nomination. At noon, a servant came to say that a lady wearing a veil was in the drawing room. I hastened to her; it was my sister Sabina.",20,RO005TR06
2641,1011,"“Things can’t go on this way,” she said, “we must make peace once and for all. Our family is coming apart; we mustn’t behave like two enemies.”",20,RO005TR06
2642,1012,"“That’s all I could ever want, sister!” I cried, holding out my arms.",20,RO005TR06
2643,1013,"I sat her by my side, and we spoke of her husband, her daughter, their affairs, everything. All was well; her daughter was as beautiful as the day. Her husband would bring her to see me, if I agreed.",20,RO005TR06
2644,1014,“But of course! I’ll go visit her myself.”,20,RO005TR06
2645,1015,“Will you?”,20,RO005TR06
2646,1016,“You have my word.”,20,RO005TR06
2647,1017,“So much the better!” sighed Sabina. “It’s time to be done with this.”,20,RO005TR06
2648,1018,"I found her plumper, and perhaps more youthful. She looked twenty, though she was over thirty. Charming, affable, not a shred of bashfulness or resentment. We stared at one another with our hands clasped, speaking of everything and nothing, like two sweethearts. My childhood itself was reviving, fresh-faced, boisterous, and fair; the years tumbled away like the castles of cards I used to play with as a boy, allowing me to glimpse our house, our family, our celebrations. I bore up under the memory with some effort; but a barber in the neighborhood took it upon himself to begin scratching away at an old fiddle, and that voice—the memory had been mute until then—that voice from the past, twanging and nostalgic, moved me so greatly that . . .",20,RO005TR06
2649,1019,"Her eyes were dry. Sabina had not inherited the morbid yellow flower. What did it matter? She was my sister, my blood, a piece of my mother, and I told her so, tenderly and sincerely . . . Just then, I heard a knock at the drawing-room door; I went to open it; there stood a five-year-old angel.",20,RO005TR06
2650,1020,"“Come in, Sara,” said Sabina.",20,RO005TR06
2651,1021,"It was my niece. I snatched her up and kissed her again and again; the girl, startled, pushed at my shoulder with a little hand and squirmed to get down . . . Just then, a hat emerged in the doorway, and then a man, Cotrim, none other than Cotrim. I was so moved that I set the daughter down and threw myself into the arms of the father. This effusiveness may have disconcerted him somewhat; he certainly seemed reserved. A mere prologue. Soon we were speaking like old friends.",20,RO005TR06
2652,1022,"No allusions to the past, many plans for the future, a promise to dine at each other’s houses. I made sure to say that these alternating suppers might undergo a brief interruption, as I had a notion to travel to the North. Sabina looked at Cotrim, and Cotrim at Sabina; they agreed that my notion made no sense. What on earth was there for me in the North? Wasn’t it at the Court, at the heart of the Court, that I was meant to shine and outdo all the young fellows?",20,RO005TR06
2653,1023,"There was truly none other to rival me; he, Cotrim, had been observing me from a distance, and despite our ridiculous quarrel, he had always taken an interest, pride, and satisfaction in my triumphs. He had heard what was being said about me, on the streets and in the salons; it was a concert of praise and admiration. And leave all that to spend a few months in the provinces when there was no need, no serious reason? Unless it were political . . .",20,RO005TR06
2654,1024,"“That’s precisely what it is,” I said.",20,RO005TR06

2656,1026,"“Of course I will; but tomorrow or the night after, you must come dine with me.”",20,RO005TR06
2657,1027,"“I don’t know, I don’t know,” objected Sabina, “yours is a bachelor’s house . . . You’ve got to get married, brother. I want a niece of my own, you hear?”",20,RO005TR06

2660,1030,A MATTER OF BOTANY,20,RO005TR06
2661,1031,"Let the hypochondriacs say what they will: life is sweet. That was what I thought to myself as I watched Sabina, her husband, and her daughter bundle down the stairs, calling up many affectionate things to where I stood—at the top—calling down in turn. I kept on thinking that, in truth, I was happy. I had the love of a woman, the trust of her husband, I would go as secretary to both, and I had reconciled with my family. What more could I ask for in twenty-four hours?",20,RO005TR06
2662,1032,"On that very day, trying to pave the way in the public sentiment, I started to make it known that I might go to the North as provincial secretary so as to carry out certain political designs of a personal nature. I said so on the Rua do Ouvidor, and repeated it the following day at the Pharoux and at the theater. Some, connecting my nomination to that of Lobo Neves, which was already rumored, smiled mischievously; others clapped me on the shoulder. At the theater, a lady commented to me that I was taking my love of sculpture to inordinate lengths. She was referring to Virgília’s magnificent figure.",20,RO005TR06
2663,1033,"But the most barefaced allusion came at Sabina’s house, three days later. It was made by one Garcez, an elderly surgeon, a trivial, blathering fellow of the sort who might reach seventy, eighty, or ninety years of age without ever acquiring that austere composure that is the grace of the aged. A ridiculous old age may be the last, saddest surprise that human nature reserves for us.",20,RO005TR06
2664,1034,"“I know—this time you’ll be reading Cicero,” he said to me, upon hearing of the trip.",20,RO005TR06

2666,1036,"“What of it? Your brother is a great Latinist. He can translate Virgil at a glance. Virgil, mind, not Virgília . . . don’t confuse the two . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2667,1037,"And he laughed, a coarse, contemptible, frivolous laugh. Sabina looked at me, fearing some retort; but when she saw me smile, she smiled as well, then turned away to hide it. The others looked at me with an air of curiosity, indulgence, and sympathy; it was clear that they had heard nothing new. My affair was more public than I could have imagined. Nevertheless, I smiled, a brief, fleeting, greedy smile—as garrulous as the gossiping magpies of Sintra. Virgília was a beautiful transgression, and it is so easy to confess a beautiful transgression!",20,RO005TR06
2668,1038,"At first I grew surly when I heard allusions to our love; but—I swear to you!—I felt a soft, flattering sensation inside. Once it so happened that I smiled, and I kept on doing so on subsequent occasions. I do not know whether anyone can explain this phenomenon. My explanation is as follows: my contentment, for as long as it remained within me, was itself a smile, but a smile in the bud. As time went on, it bloomed into flower and appeared to the eyes of others. A simple matter of botany.",20,RO005TR06

2673,1043,“Why?”,20,RO005TR06
2674,1044,"“You know very well why,” he replied. “It’s dangerous, above all, very dangerous. Here at the Court, an affair like this fades into a multitude of people and interests, but in the provinces things are different; and when it comes to political figures, things become pure madness. As soon as they sniff it out, the opposition papers will put it in the headlines, and next will be the sallies, the insinuations, the nicknames . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2675,1045,“But I don’t understand . . .”,20,RO005TR06
2676,1046,"“Yes, you do. As a matter of fact, you would hardly be a friend to us if you denied what everyone knows. I’ve known of it for many months. I repeat, do not take this journey; endure the absence, which is preferable, and you may avoid a great scandal and even greater grief . . .”",20,RO005TR06
2677,1047,"This he said, and went back in. I remained there with my eyes on the street lamp at the corner—an old oil lamp—sorrowful, dim, and curved like a question mark. What was I to do? It was the challenge put to Hamlet: either suffer fortune, or take up arms against it and bend it to my will. In other words: to embark or not to embark. That was the question. The street lamp told me nothing. Cotrim’s words echoed in the ears of my memory, and with a very different ring from Garcez’s. Perhaps Cotrim was right; but could I part from Virgília?",20,RO005TR06

2681,1051,"The next day, I opened up a political paper and read the news that by a decree of the 13th, Lobo Neves and I had been named president and secretary of the province of ***. I wrote to Virgília immediately, and two hours later I went to Gamboa. Poor Dona Plácida! She was growing ever more distressed; she asked if we might forget our old woman, if we would be away very long, whether the province was very far away. Though I consoled her, I needed consoling myself; Cotrim’s objections were distressing me. Virgília arrived shortly thereafter, lively as a swallow; but upon seeing me sad, she grew quite serious.",20,RO005TR06

His father had died on a 13th, thirteen days after a supper attended by thirteen people. The house in which his mother had died was number 13. Et cetera. It was an ill-fated figure. He could never claim as much to the minister; he would have to allege that he had personal motives to refuse the nomination. I was left much as the reader must be, somewhat astonished by this sacrifice to a number; but since he was an ambitious man, the sacrifice must have been heartfelt . . .1",20,RO005TR06

2695,1065,"Fateful number, do you recall how many times I blessed you? Thus the red-headed virgins of Thebes must have blessed the red-maned mare that stood in for them in Pelopidas’s sacrifice—a lovely mare who died there, covered with flowers, with no one to give her a word of remembrance.1 Well, I will give you one, piteous mare, and not only for your pious death, but also because, among the spared maidens, there may very well have been a grandmother of the Cubas line . . .",20,RO005TR06
2696,1066,"Fateful number, you were our salvation. Her husband never confessed to me why he had refused the nomination; he also told me that he had private matters to attend to, and the serious, persuaded look with which I listened to him was a tribute to humanity’s capacity for dissembling. He, on the other hand, could barely disguise the profound sorrow eating away at him; he spoke very little, became withdrawn, and took to retiring to his home and reading. At other times he would receive guests, and then he conversed and laughed a great deal, loudly and affectedly.",20,RO005TR06
2697,1067,"He was oppressed by two things—ambition, whose wings had been clipped by a worry, and then doubt, hard on its heels—and perhaps regret as well, but a regret that would come again if the scenario were to repeat itself, for the superstitious foundation remained. He doubted his superstition without coming to reject it. The persistence of a sentiment in an individual who finds it loathsome was a phenomenon worthy of some attention. But I preferred the pure naiveté of Dona Plácida when she confessed that she couldn’t bear to see an upturned shoe.",20,RO005TR06

She had been told that as a child, with no other explanation, and she was content with the general certainty of its being bad. The same was not true, however, of pointing at a star with one’s finger; in that case, she knew perfectly well that it would cause a wart to grow.",20,RO005TR06
2702,1072,"A wart, or whatever it might be, what was that compared with losing a provincial presidency? A free or cheap superstition may be tolerated; one that carries off a part of one’s life is unbearable. This was the case of Lobo Neves, added to which was his doubt and his dread of having behaved ridiculously. And what was more, the minister was unconvinced by his personal motives and attributed Lobo Neves’s refusal to political maneuverings, a perception aggravated by appearances; the minister treated him poorly, made his distrust known to colleagues; incidents came to pass; eventually, after some time, the resigning president went over to the opposition.",20,RO005TR06

The presidency thus merely revived our initial affections, in the end; it was the drug that we used to savor our love all the more, and prize it more greatly as well. In the first days after the incident, we delighted in imagining the pain of our separation, if it had come to pass, and the growing sadness of each as the sea expanded between us like an elastic sheet; and, like children who run to their mothers’ laps to flee from a pulled face, we fled from the imagined danger, holding each other tight.",20,RO005TR06

A subtle fluid swam through my whole body: a powerful, swift, singular sensation that I shall never be able to fix on paper. I clasped her hands, drew her gently toward me, and kissed her on the forehead with the delicacy of a zephyr and the gravity of an Abraham.

Viegas passed by here a while back, from atop his seventy years, stifled by asthma and disjointed by rheumatism, and with a damaged heart to boot. He was among the keen-eyed observers of our adventure. Virgília harbored great hopes that this old relative of hers, a man as grasping as the grave, would see to her son’s future with some inheritance; if her husband thought similarly, he concealed or strangled those reflections.",20,RO005TR06
2717,1087,"The truth must be told: Lobo Neves bore a measure of fundamental dignity, a layer of rock that stood firm against the dealings of men. The upper layers of loose soil and sand were carried away by life, which is a perpetual torrent. If the reader still recalls Chapter XXIII, he will observe that this is now the second time that I have compared life to a torrent; but he will also note that this time I have added an adjective: perpetual. And God knows the power of an adjective, principally in new and balmy countries.",20,RO005TR06

Yes, those layers of character that life alters, preserves, or dissolves, according to their resistance, those layers would merit a chapter, which I will not write so as to not draw out the story. I shall only say that the most righteous man I ever met in my life was one Jacó Medeiros or Jacó Valadares, I can’t remember his name precisely. Perhaps it was Jacó Rodrigues; in any case, Jacó.",20,RO005TR06
2719,1089,"He was righteousness in the flesh; he could have become a rich man by violating a tiny scruple, and refused to do so; he let no less than four hundred thousand milréis slip through his hands; and he was so exemplary in his righteousness that it became petty and wearisome. One day, when we found ourselves alone at his house in lively conversation, we received word that Dr. B., a tiresome fellow, had come to call. Jacó asked to say that he wasn’t at home.",20,RO005TR06

Once we had breathed, I said to Jacó that he had just lied four times in less than two hours: the first, by denying his presence; the second, by rejoicing at the unwanted visitor; the third, by saying that he was going out; and the fourth, by adding that he was going with his wife. Jacó reflected for a moment and then confessed to the accuracy of my observation, but excused himself by saying that absolute veracity was incompatible with an advanced state of society, and that the peace and prosperity of cities might be maintained only through reciprocal deceit . . .

2728,1098,"Virgília’s case was slightly more serious. She was less scrupulous than her husband: she manifested her hopes of an inheritance quite clearly, heaping upon her relative enough courtesies, cares, and caresses to earn her at least a codicil. She fawned over him, to put it plainly; but I observed that women’s fawning is not the same as men’s. The latter lists toward servility; the former may be taken for affection.",20,RO005TR06
2729,1099,"A charmingly curving figure, a sweet word, and even physical fragility lend women’s flattery a dash of local color, an air of legitimacy. No matter the age of the fawned over; the woman will always strike him as motherly or sisterly—or as a nurse, another feminine profession for which even the ablest of men will always lack some quid, some fluid, something else entirely.",20,RO005TR06
2730,1100,"That was what I thought to myself when Virgília became all sweetness and light around her old relative. She would greet him at the door, chatting and laughing, take his hat and cane, offer her arm, and take him to a chair, or, rather, to the chair, “Viegas’s chair,” a special, comfortable construction made for the elderly or infirm. She would hasten to close a nearby window if it was windy or open the window if the day was hot, but doing so such that he should not catch a draft.",20,RO005TR06

Just beside and slightly in front sat Virgília, on a low stool, her hands on the sick man’s knees. Meanwhile, Nhonhô would come into the drawing room, not skipping about as he normally did, but discreet, meek, and serious. Viegas liked him very much.",20,RO005TR06
2734,1104,"“Come here, Nhonhô,” he would say; and with great difficulty he would insert a hand into his ample pocket, take out a box of lozenges, place one in his mouth and give the boy another. Anti-asthma lozenges. The boy said that they were quite good.",20,RO005TR06
2735,1105,"All this repeated itself, with variations. Since Viegas liked to play checkers, Virgília would indulge him, abiding at length as he moved the pieces with a slack, faltering grip.

He felt that the manse in which he lived might be replaced, and he had already ordered a plan from a renowned mason. Ah! Then Virgília would really see what an old man with good taste could get up to.",20,RO005TR06

From time to time there came a coughing fit; doubled over and moaning, he would bring his handkerchief to his mouth and then investigate its contents; once the fit had passed, he would return to the plan for the house, which was to have so many bedrooms, a terrace, a coach house—a thing of beauty.",20,RO005TR06

Virgília would go from time to time, and I took advantage of the situation to spend the day at her side. It was two o’clock in the afternoon when I arrived. Viegas was coughing so violently that I felt my own chest burn; in between fits, he was haggling over the price of a house with a thin fellow.",20,RO005TR06

The buyer insisted, with the air of a man afraid of missing a railway train, but Viegas would not give in; he first refused the thirty thousand milréis, then two more, then three more, and finally had a violent fit that kept him from speaking for fifteen minutes.

These were his accounts of the expenses on the construction of the house: bills for the stonemason, the carpenter, the painter, bills for the wallpaper in the drawing room and the dining room, the bedrooms, the studies; bills for the ironwork; the cost of the land.

Virgília swallowed her frustration bitterly, and told me so with some caution, not for the thing in itself, but because it had to do with her son, of whom she knew I was not greatly fond, nor even slightly so.

A being wrought of my being! That became my sole concern. The eyes of the world, the jealousy of her husband, the death of Viegas, nothing interested me then, neither political conflicts nor revolutions, earthquakes, or anything else. I thought only of that anonymous embryo of doubtful paternity, and a secret voice said to me: It is your child. My child!

At times, next to Virgília, I forgot her and everything else; Virgília would give me a shake and reproach me for my silence, saying that I no longer cared for her.

2766,1136,"Some time ago, in the Passeio Público, I borrowed a watch from you. I have the satisfaction of restoring it to you with this letter. The difference is that it is not the same watch, but another, which is, if not superior, then equal to the first. Que voulez-vous, monseigneur? as Figaro said—c’est la misère.1 Many things came to pass after our encounter; I will recount them precisely, if you should not close the door on me. Know that I no longer wear those decaying boots, nor the famous overcoat whose tails were lost in the mists of time. I have given up my step outside the church of São Francisco; at long last, I eat breakfast.",20,RO005TR06
2767,1137,"Having said this, I beg your leisure to present to you an undertaking, the fruit of great study, a new system of philosophy that not only explains and describes the origin and consummation of things, but also takes a great stride beyond Zeno and Seneca, whose stoicism was truly a child’s toy next to my moral prescription. My system is singularly astonishing; it rectifies the human spirit, eliminates pain, ensures happiness, and brings tremendous glory to our land. I call it Humanitism, from Humanitas, the principle behind all things.",20,RO005TR06
2768,1138,"My first idea was manifestly conceited; it was to call it Borbism, from Borba—a vain denomination, and a homely and burdensome one at that. And certainly less eloquent. You shall see, my dear Brás Cubas, you shall see that it is truly monumental; and if there is anything that can make me forget the sorrows of life, it is the joy of having finally seized on truth and happiness. Behold them in my hand, these elusive two; after so many centuries of struggle, study, discoveries, systems, and downfalls, behold them in the hands of man.

It was accompanied by a purse containing a handsome watch with my initials engraved on it, along with the following words: A keepsake from old Quincas. I returned to the letter and reread it slowly and attentively. The restitution of the watch excluded any possibility of its being a joke; the lucidity, the serenity, the conviction—a touch immodest, it’s true—seemed to exclude any suspicion of derangement. It seemed that Quincas Borba had come into an inheritance from one of his relatives in Minas, and abundance had restored his old dignity. I’ll not go so far; certain things may never be recovered in full; but some recuperation was not impossible. I put aside the letter and the watch, and awaited the philosophy.",20,RO005TR06

2774,1144,"I’ll have done with the last of the extraordinary things now. I had just put aside the letter and the watch when a thin, middling man came by with a note from Cotrim, inviting me to supper. The bearer was married to a sister of Cotrim’s, had arrived just a few days earlier from the North, was named Damasceno, and had taken part in the revolution of 1831. He told me so himself in the space of five minutes. He had left Rio de Janeiro after a disagreement with the Regent, who was an ass, only slightly less of an ass than the ministers who served under him.",20,RO005TR06
2775,1145,"For that matter, revolution was nigh yet again. On this point, while his political ideas were somewhat scrambled, I managed to organize and formulate the government of his preference: it was despotism, tempered, not by songs—as they say in other parts—but by the plumes of the National Guard. I only failed to grasp whether he favored the despotic rule of one man, three, thirty, or three hundred. He spoke in favor of several matters, among them the development of the trade in Africans and the expulsion of the English.3 He was quite fond of theater; as soon as he arrived, he had gone to the São Pedro Theater, where he saw a magnificent drama, Maria Joana, and a very interesting comedy, Kettly, or the Return to Switzerland.",20,RO005TR06
2776,1146,"He had also been very taken by Deperini, in Sappho, or in Anne Boleyn, he couldn’t quite remember which. But Candiani! Yes, sir, she was sumptuous. Now he wanted to hear Ernani, which his daughter sang at home, on the piano: “Ernani, Ernani, involami . . .” At this, he rose and sang a quiet little strain. In the North, all these things arrived as echoes. His daughter was dying to hear all the operas. She had quite a darling voice, his daughter. And taste, good taste. Ah! He’d been eager to return to Rio de Janeiro. He had already roved around the whole city, satisfying his nostalgia . . .",20,RO005TR06
2777,1147,"He swore that in a few places he almost came to tears. But he would never sail again. He had gotten quite sick on board, like all the other passengers, except an Englishman . . . The devil take them, those English! Things wouldn’t be right until they’d all been sent seaward. What could England do to us? If he were to find a few willing people, it’d be a night’s work to expel those god-damners . . . Thank God, he was a patriot—at this he thumped his chest—which was no wonder, as it ran in the family, he was descended from an old provincial governor who was a great patriot.",20,RO005TR06

But it was growing late, and he was about to say that he’d be there at the supper, where he would await me for more conversation. I took him over to the drawing-room door; there he stopped, saying that he was quite fond of me. When he had married, I was in Europe. He knew my father, an upright man, and they’d danced together at a famous ball at Praia Grande . . . Things! Things! He’d speak later, it was growing late, and he had to take my reply to Cotrim. He left; I closed the door after him . . .",20,RO005TR06

2781,1151,"What an ordeal the supper was! Happily, Sabina seated me by Damasceno’s daughter, one Dona Eulália, or, more familiarly, Nhã-loló, a charming young lady, somewhat timid at first, but only at first. She lacked in elegance, but made up for it with her eyes, which were magnificent and whose sole defect was that they never left me, except when they sank to her plate; but Nhã-loló ate so little that she hardly looked at her plate. She sang that night; her voice was, as her father had said, “quite darling.” Even so, I made my escape. Sabina came to the doorway and asked how I had found Damasceno’s daughter.",20,RO005TR06
2782,1152,“So-so.”,20,RO005TR06
2783,1153,"“Very sweet, isn’t she?” Sabina cut in. “Still a bit lacking in refinement. But what a heart! She’s a pearl. An excellent bride for you.”",20,RO005TR06

2786,1156,"And as she said this she patted me on the cheek, gentle as a dove, and yet commanding and resolute. Good Lord! Was this the reason behind our reconciliation? I was somewhat shaken by the idea, but a mysterious voice was calling me to the Lobo Neves house; I bade farewell to Sabina and her threats.",20,RO005TR06

2789,1159,“How’s my darling mother tonight?”,20,RO005TR06
2790,1160,"At this word, Virgília’s face fell, as it always did. She was alone by a window, gazing at the moon, and greeted me happily; but when I spoke of our child, her face fell. She disliked these remarks, and she shrank from my premature paternal caresses. I, for whom she had already become a sacred person, a divine ampulla, let her be. I had supposed at first that the embryo, that emblem of the unknown making its way into our adventure, had restored her awareness of our sins.",20,RO005TR06
2791,1161,"I was mistaken. Virgília had never seemed more expansive, more unreserved, less concerned about others or about her husband. There was no remorse. I also came to imagine that the pregnancy might be pure invention, a way to tie me to her, a device of no abiding efficacy and which might have begun to weigh on her. The hypothesis was not absurd; my sweet Virgília sometimes lied so charmingly!",20,RO005TR06
2792,1162,"On that night, I discovered the true cause. It was her fear of childbirth and the indignity of pregnancy. She had suffered greatly when her first child was born; and at the very thought of that hour, made up of minutes of life and minutes of death, her imagination gave her the chills of the gallows. As for the indignity, it was rendered even more onerous by the forcible privation of social pleasures. This was certainly it; I made as much known to her and delivered a reprimand, partly in the name of my rights as a father. Virgília stared at me; then she looked away and smiled incredulously.",20,RO005TR06

2795,1165,"Where are they now, the flowers of yesteryear?1 One afternoon, after a few weeks of gestation, the edifice of my paternal fantasies was reduced to rubble. The embryo departed at that stage when one can barely tell Laplace from a turtle. I received the news from Lobo Neves, who left me in the drawing room and followed the doctor to the bedroom of the frustrated mother. I leaned on the windowsill, looking out over the grounds, at the greening of the flowerless orange trees. Where had they gone, the flowers of yesteryear?",20,RO005TR06

2797,1167,THE ANONYMOUS LETTER,20,RO005TR06
2798,1168,"I felt a hand on my shoulder; it was Lobo Neves. We faced each other for a few moments, mute and inconsolable. I asked after Virgília, and then we spoke for about half an hour. At the end of that time, a letter arrived for him; he read it, went very pale, and folded it with trembling fingers. I believe that I saw him move as if to fall on me; but I can’t recall. What I do recall clearly is that during the days that followed, he was cold and taciturn in my presence. Days later, in Gamboa, Virgília finally told me everything.",20,RO005TR06
2799,1169,"Her husband had shown her the letter as soon as she recovered. It was anonymous, and it denounced us. It did not tell everything; it said nothing, for example, of our encounters outside her home; it merely warned him of my familiarity and added that the suspicions were public. Virgília read the letter and said indignantly that it was the most abominable slander.",20,RO005TR06
2800,1170,“Slander?” asked Lobo Neves.,20,RO005TR06
2801,1171,“Abominable slander.”,20,RO005TR06
2802,1172,"The husband was able to breathe again; but when he returned to the missive, it seemed that each word wagged a finger, each letter cried out against his wife’s indignation. This man, this intrepid man, had now become the most fragile of creatures. Perhaps his imagination showed him the famous eye of opinion, off in the distance, staring at him with a sarcastic and mocking air; perhaps an invisible mouth whispered into his ear all of the coarse jokes he had ever heard or proffered. He pressed his wife to confess everything, saying that all would be forgiven.",20,RO005TR06
2803,1173,"Virgília understood that she was safe; she made her irritation at his insistence clear and swore that she had only ever heard courteous and witty remarks from me. The letter had to be from some luckless suitor. And she mentioned a few—one who had courted her openly for three weeks, another who had written her a letter, and more, and still more. She mentioned them by name, providing details, studying her husband’s eyes, and concluded by saying that, so as to give the slander no foothold, she would treat me in such a way that I would not return.",20,RO005TR06
2804,1174,"I absorbed all of this somewhat troubled, not because of the additional deception that would be required from here on out, going so far as to distance myself entirely from Lobo Neves’s house, but because of Virgília’s moral serenity, the lack of commotion, fright, longing, or even remorse. Virgília noted my concern, lifted my chin, for I had been looking at the floor, and said somewhat bitterly:",20,RO005TR06
2805,1175,“You’re not worth the sacrifices I make.”,20,RO005TR06
2806,1176,"I said nothing; there would be no use in reflecting to her that a bit of despair and terror would lend our situation the biting tang of its early days; and if I did say so, it was not impossible that she might build up that hint of despair and terror slowly and cunningly. I said nothing. She was tapping her toe nervously; I leaned over and kissed her on the forehead. Virgília recoiled as if it had been the kiss of a dead man.",20,RO005TR06

2809,1179,"I feel that the reader has shuddered—or ought to have shuddered. Naturally, those last words have suggested three or four reflections. Regard the picture well: in a little house in Gamboa, two people who have loved one another for a long time, one leaning over the other and kissing the other’s forehead, and the other recoiling as if at the touch of a cadaver’s mouth. There in the brief span between lips and forehead, before the kiss and after the kiss, there is an ample space that may be inhabited by many a thing: a grimace of resentment, a wrinkle of distrust, or the pale, drowsy nose of satiety . . .",20,RO005TR06

2811,1181,TAKEN OUT,20,RO005TR06
2812,1182,"We parted in good spirits. I went to supper, at peace with the situation. The anonymous letter had restored the salt of mystery and the pepper of danger to our adventure; and in the end it was well and good that Virgília hadn’t lost her self-possession during the crisis. That night I went to the São Pedro Theater; a great play was being performed, and Estela was wrenching tears from the audience. I went in; I ran my eyes across the boxes; in one of them I saw Damasceno and his family. The daughter was dressed with uncommon elegance and a surprising measure of refinement, as her father earned only enough to go into debt; for that matter, perhaps this was the reason.",20,RO005TR06
2813,1183,"At intermission, I went to visit them. Damasceno greeted me with many words, his wife with many smiles. As for Nhã-loló, she never took her eyes off me. She now seemed prettier than on the day of the supper. I saw in her a certain ethereal softness wedded to the refinement of earthly forms: that is a vague turn of phrase, worthy of a chapter in which all must be vague. Truly, I know not how to express to you that I felt quite fine next to that young lady, who was smartly dressed in an exquisite gown, a gown that gave me Tartuffian ticklings.",20,RO005TR06
2814,1184,"As I contemplated the gown, which was chastely and wholly covering its wearer’s knees, I made a subtle discovery: to wit, that nature foresaw human vesture as a necessary condition for the development of our species. Habitual nudity, in light of the multiplication of individuals’ works and cares, would tend to dull the senses and hold back the sexes, while clothing, by provoking nature, whets and entices desires, activates them, reproduces them, and thus moves civilization forward. Blessed be the habit that has given us Othello and transatlantic steamers!",20,RO005TR06
2815,1185,"I have a mind to take out this chapter. This downward slope is a dangerous one. But after all, I am writing my memoirs and not yours, mild reader. Next to that charming damsel, I felt myself overtaken by a twofold, indefinable sensation. It wholly expressed Pascal’s duality, l’ange et la bête, the difference being that the Jansenist would not stand for the simultaneity of both natures, while here they were quite nicely joined—l’ange, which spoke a few heavenly words—and la bête, which . . .1 No; decidedly, I’ll take this chapter out.",20,RO005TR06

2818,1188,"In the orchestra seats I found Lobo Neves talking with a few friends. We spoke briefly and coldly, equally uneasy. But at the next intermission, just as the curtain was about to go up, we met in one of the hallways with no one else around. He came over to me, quite affable and smiling, pulled me over to an oculus, and we spoke at length, principally he, who seemed to be the calmest of men. I even asked after his wife; he replied that she was well, but soon turned the conversation toward general affairs, speaking expansively and almost gaily. Whoever would like to guess at the cause of this change may do so; as for me, I’ll flee from Damasceno, who is watching me from the door of his box.",20,RO005TR06
2819,1189,"I heard nothing of the second act, neither the words of the actors nor the applause of the audience. Reclining in my chair, I plucked the shreds of the conversation with Lobo Neves from memory, reconstructed his behavior, and concluded that this new situation was far preferable. Gamboa was enough for us. Frequenting the other house would only sharpen jealousies. Really, we could go without speaking every day; this was even better, for it introduced a note of longing into our love. As for the rest, I was past forty and I had become nothing, not even a parish elector. I had to do something, if only for love of Virgília, who would swell with pride when she saw my name shine . . . I believe that just then there was a great round of applause, but I can’t swear to it; I was thinking of something else.",20,RO005TR06
2820,1190,"O multitude, whose love I coveted unto death, this was how I avenged myself on you at times; I let humanity thrum around my body without hearing it, as Aeschylus’s Prometheus did to his tormentors. Ah! You thought you had chained me to the rock of your frivolity, your indifference, your agitation? Fragile chains, my dear friend; I shattered them with a Gulliverian gesture. It is only too common to go contemplate in the wilderness.",20,RO005TR06
2821,1191,"What is truly sensuous and exquisite is for a man to insulate himself in the midst of a sea of gestures and words, nerves and passions, to declare himself lost in thought, inaccessible, absent. The most that one can say of him, when he returns to himself—that is, when he returns to the company of others—is that he has come down from the moon; but the moon, that luminous, discreet garret of the brain, what is it if not the disdainful affirmation of our spiritual freedom?

2824,1194,"If this world were not a realm of inattentive souls, there would be no need to remind the reader that I affirm certain laws only when I am entirely sure of them; as for the rest, I limit myself to admitting their probability. An example of the second class may be found in the present chapter, the reading of which I recommend to all those who appreciate the study of social phenomena. It would seem, and this is not improbable, that between the events of public life and those of private life there is a sort of reciprocal, regular, and perhaps periodical interaction at work—or, to make use of an image, something similar to the tides on Flamengo Beach and on other, equally surf-beaten shores. Indeed, as each wave falls upon the beach, it flows far across the sand; and yet that same water returns to the sea, whether with equal strength or less, and goes to join the wave yet to come, which will flow back in turn like the first. This is the image; let us see its application.",20,RO005TR06
2825,1195,"I said on another page that Lobo Neves, having been named provincial president, refused the nomination on the grounds of the date of the decree, which was the 13th: a grave act, the consequence of which was to separate Virgília’s husband from the administration. Thus, the private fact of aversion toward a number gave rise to the phenomenon of a political breach. We have only to see how, some time later, a political act was to decree the cessation of movement in private life. Since it would not suit the method of this book to immediately describe that other phenomenon, I will simply say for now that Lobo Neves, four months after our encounter at the theater, reconciled with the administration: a fact that the reader should not lose from sight should he wish to penetrate the subtlety of my thought.",20,RO005TR06

2830,1200,"She let the corners of her mouth sag, and shook her head; but this gesture of indifference was belied by something less definable, less clear, an expression of pleasure and expectation. I can’t say why, but I imagined that the imperial letter of nomination might draw her back to virtue, not for virtue’s sake but out of gratitude to her husband. She had a sincere love of nobility. One of the greatest afflictions to ever buffet our life together had been the appearance of a fop from the legation of—from the legation of Dalmatia, let’s say—one Count B.V., who flirted with her for three months. This man, a true nobleman by blood, turned Virgília’s head somewhat; on top of it all, she had a talent for diplomacy. I can’t say what might have become of me if a revolution hadn’t broken out in Dalmatia, toppling the government and purging the embassies. It was a bloody revolution, harrowing and formidable; at each ship that arrived from Europe, the newspapers transcribed the fresh horrors, measured the blood spilt, counted the severed heads; all groaned with indignation and pity . . .

2837,1207,"Dona Plácida was right. No gentleman arrives a full hour late to the place where his lady is waiting. I came in out of breath; Virgília had gone. Dona Plácida told me that she had waited a long time, grown irritated, cried, and swore to never see me again, among other things that our housekeeper related with a catch in her voice, begging me not to forsake her missus, saying that it would be so unfair after she’d sacrificed everything for me. I explained that it had been a mistake, and so on . . . But it wasn’t, I believe it was pure distraction. A pleasantry, a conversation, a joke, something of the sort had kept me; it had been pure distraction.",20,RO005TR06
2838,1208,"Poor Dona Plácida! She was truly distraught. She was pacing back and forth, wagging her head, sighing clamorously, glancing out the window from time to time. Poor Dona Plácida! With what skill she had tucked in the linens, caressed the cheeks, and lulled the tantrums of our love! What a fertile imagination in making the hours more pleasurable and fleeting! Flowers, sweets—the delightful sweets of old—all wreathed in smiles and endearments, smiles and endearments that only increased over time, as if she wished to fix our adventure as it was, or restore its first bloom.",20,RO005TR06
2839,1209,"Our confidante and housekeeper would stop at nothing; nothing, not even lies, for she recounted sighs and longings to each of us that she had manifestly not witnessed; nothing, not even slander, for she once accused me of having found a new love. “You know I could never care for another woman,” was my reply when Virgília spoke of it to me. And those words alone, with no protest or reproof, were enough to dissolve Dona Plácida’s slanders, to her distress.",20,RO005TR06

I recommend this gesture to people who have no ready response, or to those who fear to face the pupils of other eyes. Under such circumstances, some prefer to recite a stanza from the Lusiads, while others turn to the recourse of whistling Norma. I am partial to the gesture I mentioned; it is simpler and calls for less effort.",20,RO005TR06
2843,1213,"Three days later, all was explained. I suppose that Virgília was a little startled when I begged her forgiveness for the tears I’d made her shed on that sad occasion. I can’t recall whether, deep down, I suspected that the tears had been Dona Plácida’s. Indeed, it might have been the case that Dona Plácida had wept upon seeing her disappointed, and through some visual phenomenon, the tears in her own eyes seemed to be falling from Virgília’s. Be that as it may, all was explained, but not forgiven, much less forgotten.",20,RO005TR06
2844,1214,"Virgília had no few harsh words for me, threatened me with separation, and praised her husband. He was a worthy man, far superior to me, a paragon of courtesy and affection; that’s what she said as I sat with my elbows planted on my knees, looking at the floor, where a fly was dragging along an ant that had bitten its leg.

I sat down by her and said many a tender thing, some humble things and a few charming ones. I can’t declare whether our lips came as close as the breadth of a cambric thread, or even closer; that is a matter of controversy. What I do recall is that in the excitement, one of Virgília’s earrings fell off; I leaned over to pick it up, and the fly I had seen climbed onto the earring, still dragging the ant along on its leg.",20,RO005TR06

If you happen to conclude from this that I was a barbarian, you are roundly mistaken, for I asked Virgília for a hairpin so as to separate the two insects; but the fly sniffed out my intention, opened its wings, and flew off.

I immediately came out of the bedroom and took two steps on my way to tear Virgília away from her husband; that was what I said, and it was good that I did, because Dona Plácida held me back. At one time I came to the conclusion that I had said it only so that she would hold me back; but simple reflection will suffice to show that, after the ten minutes I had spent in the bedroom, the most genuine and heartfelt gesture could only have been that. This follows from the famous law of the equivalence of windows, which I had the satisfaction of discovering and formulating in Chapter LI. My conscience needed airing. The bedroom was a closed window; I opened another, with my move to go out, and took a breath.",20,RO005TR06

2877,1247,A DANGEROUS GAME,20,RO005TR06
2878,1248,"I took a breath and sat down. Dona Plácida was thundering around the parlor, filling it with exclamations and lamentations. I listened without saying a thing; I reflected whether it wouldn’t have been better to have shut Virgília in the bedroom and stayed in the parlor, but I soon saw that it would have been worse; it would have confirmed suspicions, the spark would hit the gunpowder, and there would be a bloody scene . . . Things were much better this way. But what was to come? What would happen at Virgília’s house? Would her husband kill her? Beat her? Lock her away? Throw her out? These interrogations made their way slowly through my brain, just like the dark periods and commas that make their way across the field of vision of tired or ill eyes. They came and went, with their dry, tragic look, and I was unable to seize one of them and say: It’s you, you and no other.",20,RO005TR06
2879,1249,"Suddenly I saw a black figure before me; it was Dona Plácida, who had gone in, put on her mantilla, and was offering to go to Lobo Neves’s house. I reflected that it was dangerous, that he would be suspicious of such a hasty visit.",20,RO005TR06
2880,1250,"“Don’t worry,” she interrupted, “I’ll know how to go about things. If he’s at home, I won’t go in.”",20,RO005TR06
2881,1251,"She went out; I was left ruminating on the incident and its possible consequences. In the end, it struck me that I was playing a dangerous game, and I wondered if it wasn’t time for me to get up and move along. I felt overcome with a longing for marriage, a desire to channel my life. Why not? My heart still had room to explore; I did not feel incapable of a chaste, severe, pure love. In the end, adventures are the torrential, vertiginous part of life, the exception; I had wearied of them; and, I can’t say for certain, but I may have felt a prick of remorse. No sooner had I thought this, I let myself follow my imagination; I then saw myself married, with a winsome wife by my side, gazing on a babe sleeping in its nanny’s lap, all of us far off along the green and shady grounds of a country home, and through the trees we could make out a sliver of sky that was blue, extraordinarily blue . . .",20,RO005TR06

2887,1257,"Herein lies the drama, here you have the tip of the ear of a Shakespearean tragedy.1 That scrap of paper, scrawled in parts, crumpled by hands, was a document befitting analysis, something I will not do in this chapter, nor in the next, or perhaps anywhere in the rest of the book. Could I deprive the reader of the pleasure of noting for himself the coldness, the perspicacity, and the spirit of these few hastily written lines, and behind them the tempest in the other person’s brain, the disguised rage, the despair that stifles itself and meditates, as it can only come out in mud, blood, or tears?",20,RO005TR06
2888,1258,"As for myself, if I should tell you that I read the note three or four times that day, believe it, because it’s true; what’s more, if I should tell you that I reread it the next day, before and after breakfast, you may believe it, as it is pure reality. But if I should tell you of the commotion I felt, you should feel free to doubt me, and mustn’t accept my statement without proof. I was unable then, and remain unable still, to discern what I felt. It was fear, yet it was not fear; it was pity, yet it was not pity; it was vanity, yet it was not vanity; to wit, it was love without love, that is, a love without delirium; and all this came to a combination that was altogether complex and vague, something you will not understand, just as I failed to. Let us suppose that I said nothing at all.",20,RO005TR06

2890,1260,THE PHILOSOPHER,20,RO005TR06
2891,1261,"It being known that I reread the letter before and after breakfast, one may deduce that I breakfasted, and all that remains to say is that this was one of the most sparing meals of my life: an egg, a slice of bread, a cup of tea. I did not forget this tiny detail; amidst so many important things which were obliterated, that breakfast was saved. The principal reason might have been precisely my misfortune; but it was not; the principal reason was the reflection I heard from Quincas Borba, who visited me that day.",20,RO005TR06
2892,1262,"He told me that frugality was not necessary to understand Humanitism, much less to practice it; that this philosophy was easily reconciled with the pleasures of life, including the table, the theater, and love; and that, indeed, frugality might indicate a certain tendency toward asceticism, which was the fullest expression of human foolishness.",20,RO005TR06
2893,1263,"“Take Saint John,” he went on. “He lived off grasshoppers in the desert, instead of peacefully growing fat in the city and starving out the Pharisees in the synagogue.”",20,RO005TR06
2894,1264,"God spare me the task of telling Quincas Borba’s story, which I heard in its entirety on that sad occasion: it was a long and complicated story, but an interesting one. And as long as I’m not telling the story, I will likewise excuse myself from describing his appearance, which was greatly changed from that which I had seen in the Passeio Público. I’ll be silent; I’ll say only that if a man is defined essentially not by his features but by his attire, then this was not Quincas Borba; he was a judge without a robe, a general without a uniform, a merchant without a deficit. I noted the perfection of his overcoat, the whiteness of his shirt, the cleanliness of his boots.",20,RO005TR06
2895,1265,"His very voice, once hoarse, seemed restored to its old resonance. As for his gesticulation, while it had not lost the liveliness of old, it was no longer quite so wild, and obeyed a certain order. But I don’t want to describe him. If I spoke, for example, of the gold stud at his breast, or of the quality of the leather of his boots, I would begin a description, which I will leave out for the sake of brevity. Content yourselves with the knowledge that the boots were patent leather. And the fact that he had inherited many thousands of milréis from an old uncle in Barbacena.",20,RO005TR06
2896,1266,"My spirit (allow me a childish comparison!), my spirit was, just then, like a sort of shuttlecock. Quincas Borba’s story would give it a blow, and it rose; just as it was about to fall, Virgília’s note would give it another blow, and it was thrown into the air once again; it began to sink, and the episode from the Passeio Público would meet it with a fresh blow, just as firm and powerful as the first. I don’t believe I was born for complex situations. This pulling and pushing of opposite things unbalanced me; I felt an urge to wrap up Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves, and Virgília’s note in a single philosophy and send them to Aristotle as a present. Nevertheless, our philosopher’s narration was instructive; I wondered at the talent for observation with which he described the gestation and growth of vice, internal struggles, slow capitulations, and the creeping familiarity of the mire.",20,RO005TR06
2897,1267,"“Look here,” he observed, “the first night I spent on the São Francisco steps, I slept as soundly as if they were the finest feather bed. Why?

The Greeks thought they’d pull the truth out of a well.1 What a small-minded notion! A well! But that’s precisely why they never found it. Greeks, sub-Greeks, anti-Greeks, a whole long line of men leaned over the well in hopes of seeing the truth emerge from it, and it was never there to begin with. They wore out ropes and pails; some of the more daring ones went down to the bottom and brought up a frog. I went straight to the sea. Come to Humanitism.”",20,RO005TR06

2907,1277,"As it is not my custom to disguise or hide anything, I will devote this page to the story of the wall. They were just about to set sail. As I walked into Dona Plácida’s house, I saw a folded paper on the table; it was a note from Virgília saying that she would wait for me that night, in the back garden, without fail. It concluded: “The wall is low on the alley side.”",20,RO005TR06
2908,1278,"I scowled in irritation. The letter seemed uncommonly daring, poorly thought out, even ridiculous. This wasn’t just an invitation to scandal, it was begging for mockery to boot. I imagined myself climbing over the wall, however low and near the alley it might be; and, just as I was about to cross it, I saw myself pounced upon by an officer of the law and taken to jail. The wall is low! And what of it? Of course Virgília had no idea what she’d done; she might already have regretted it. I looked at the paper, which was wrinkled but inflexible. I felt an itch to tear it up into thirty thousand pieces and throw them to the wind as the last spoils of my adventure; but I drew back in time. Self-love, the indignity of the flight, the idea of fear . . . There was nothing to do but go.",20,RO005TR06

2916,1286,"I had a strange feeling. I reread the note, looked at it, and looked again; it was, in fact, an old note from Virgília, received at the start of our affair, arranging a meeting in the back garden, for which I had indeed climbed over the wall, a low, discreet wall. I tucked the paper away, and . . . I had a strange feeling.",20,RO005TR06

2919,1289,"But it was written: that day was to be one of obscure incidents. A few hours later, I came across Lobo Neves on the Rua do Ouvidor; we spoke of the presidency and of politics. He seized on the first acquaintance who drifted by and left me, after many warm greetings. I recall that he was reserved, but struggling to disguise that reserve. It struck me then (and may the critics forgive me if this judgment should prove presumptuous!), it struck me that he was afraid—not of me, or himself, or the law, or his conscience; he was afraid of public opinion.",20,RO005TR06
2920,1290,"I surmised that this anonymous, invisible court, in which each member both prosecutes and judges, was the check on Lobo Neves’s free will. Perhaps he no longer loved his wife; his heart might have been cold to the indulgence of his latest actions. I believe (again, I must appeal to the goodwill of the critics!), I believe that he would be willing to break with his wife, as the reader must have broken off many personal relations; but public opinion—that opinion which would drag his life through every street, open up a painstaking inquiry into the case, gather each detail, precedent, inference, and piece of evidence, one by one, and relate them in idle sitting-room conversations, that fearsome public opinion, with its fascination for bedrooms—stood in the way of the dissolution of the family.",20,RO005TR06

2922,1292,"At the same time, it made revenge impossible, for it would mean revealing all to the world. He could not show his resentment of me without seeking a marital separation; so he was forced to simulate his prior ignorance, as well as the same sentiments he had harbored then.",20,RO005TR06
2923,1293,"It pained him, I do believe; especially during those days, from what I saw of him, it pained him greatly. But time (and this is another point on which I must beg the indulgence of thinking men!), time hardens sensibilities and obliterates the memory of things; one might suppose that the years would wear down the thorns, that distance from events would erase their contours, that a retrospective shadow of doubt would cover the nakedness of reality; in other words, that public opinion would come to occupy itself with other adventures. As the son grew, he would seek to satisfy his father’s ambitions, and would be the heir to all his affections. That and public activity, prestige, and then old age, infirmity, decline, and death, a requiem, an obituary, and the book of life would be shut without a single page of bloodshed.",20,RO005TR06

It is not impossible that I may expand on this idea before the book is out; but neither is it impossible that I may leave it as it is. One way or another, public opinion is a fine solder, in both the domestic realm and the political. Some bilious metaphysicians have gone to the extreme of calling it the simple product of foolish or mediocre minds; but it is evident that, even if such an extreme notion were not its own refutation, one has only to consider the salutary effects of public opinion to conclude that it is the highly sophisticated result of the flower of mankind—that is, of the majority.",20,RO005TR06

2946,1316,"I did not see her off; but at the appointed hour I felt something that was neither pain nor pleasure, a mixture of relief and longing, mingled together in equal proportion. Reader, do not be irritated by this confession. I am well aware that in order to titillate your fancy, I ought to sink into tremendous despair, shed a few tears, and forgo lunch. It would be novelesque, but it would not be biographical. The pure reality is that I lunched, as I had on other days, succoring my heart with the memories of my adventure and my stomach with the delicacies of Monsieur Prudhon . . .",20,RO005TR06
2947,1317,". . . Old men of my time, do you perchance remember that master chef at the Hotel Pharoux, a fellow who, according to the owner, had served at the famous Véry and Véfour in Paris, as well as at the palaces of Count Molé and the Duke de la Rochefoucauld? He was an illustrious figure. He came to Rio de Janeiro at the same time as the polka . . . The polka, M. Prudhon, the Tivoli, the Foreigners’ Ball, the Casino, there you have some of the best recollections of that time; but the master’s delicacies were the most splendid of them all.",20,RO005TR06
2948,1318,"Indeed they were, and on that morning it seemed that devil of a chef had guessed at our misfortune. Never had ingenuity and artifice smiled on him as they did then. What refined spices! What tender meats! What elegant forms! One ate with one’s mouth, eyes, and nose. I didn’t save the bill that day; I know it was costly. Ah, the pain! I needed to bury my love in magnificent fashion. There it went, away across the sea, in space and time, and I remained there at the end of the table, with my forty-odd years, so idle and so empty; I remained, never to see my love again, for even if she could return, as return she did, who would ever ask for the fragrance of morning when faced with the twilight of afternoon?",20,RO005TR06

2951,1321,"I was left so sad by the end of the last chapter that I might have resolved not to write this one, rest a while, purge my spirit of the melancholy weighing on it, and continue later. But no, I don’t want to waste time.",20,RO005TR06
2952,1322,"Virgília’s departure gave me a taste of life as a widower. During the first days I shut myself up at home, spearing flies—like Domitian did, if Suetonius isn’t lying—but spearing them in a very particular way: with my eyes. I speared them one by one, tucked away in a spacious drawing room, stretched out in the hammock with an open book in my hands. That was all: nostalgia, ambitions, a bit of tedium, and a great deal of wandering daydreams. My uncle the priest died during this time, as did two cousins. I was not distraught; I took them to the cemetery as one might take money to the bank. What am I saying? As one might take letters to the post office: I sealed the letters, put them in the box, and entrusted the letter carrier with the task of delivering them to the recipient. It was around then that my niece Venância, Cotrim’s daughter, was born. Some died, others were born; I was left to the flies.",20,RO005TR06
2953,1323,"At other times I grew agitated. I would go to my desk drawers, spill out old letters from friends, relatives, loves (even from Marcela), and open all of them, read them one by one, and reconstruct the past tense . . . Ignorant reader, if you fail to keep the letters of your youth, you will never come to know the philosophy of old papers; you will not savor the pleasure of seeing yourself, off in the half-light, sporting a tricorn hat, seven-league boots and an Assyrian beard, dancing to the sound of an Anacreontic panpipe. Keep the letters of your youth!",20,RO005TR06
2954,1324,"Or, if the tricorn hat isn’t to your liking, I will avail myself of the words of an old seaman who frequented Cotrim’s house; I will say that, should you keep the letters of your youth, you will find reason to “sing a yearning.” It seems that our seamen refer in such a way to songs of the land, when sung on the high seas. As poetic expressions go, it is the saddest you can ask for.2",20,RO005TR06

2956,1326,HUMANITISM,20,RO005TR06
2957,1327,"Two forces, however, to be joined by a third, compelled me to return to my habitually bustling life: Sabina and Quincas Borba. My sister had advanced Nhã-loló’s marital candidacy in truly forceful fashion. When I came to, the girl was practically in my arms. As for Quincas Borba, he finally explained Humanitism, the philosophical system designed to ruin all the rest.",20,RO005TR06
2958,1328,"“Humanitas,” he said, “the principle of things, is nothing but man himself, divided across all other men. Humanitas has three stages: the static, preceding all creation; the expansive, the beginning of things; the dispersive, the appearance of man; and it will have yet another, the contractive, the absorption of man and things. Expansion, in beginning the universe, suggested to Humanitas the desire to enjoy it; hence the dispersion, which is nothing more than the personified multiplication of the original substance.”",20,RO005TR06
2959,1329,"As this interpretation did not strike me as entirely clear, Quincas Borba expanded on it in greater depth, dwelling on its overarching lines. He explained to me that on one side Humanitism was connected to Brahmanism, in terms of the distribution of men across the various parts of the body of Humanitas; but that which in the Indian religion bore only a narrow theological and political meaning was, in Humanitism, the great law of personal value. Thus, to descend from the chest or the kidneys of Humanitas—that is, to be essentially strong—was not the same as descending from its hair or the tip of its nose. Hence the need to cultivate and temper one’s muscles. Hercules was nothing but an early symbol of Humanitism.",20,RO005TR06
2960,1330,"On this point, Quincas Borba pondered that paganism might have arrived at the truth had it not become belittled by the bawdier aspects of its myths. Nothing of the sort would happen to Humanitism. In this new church there are no facile adventures, nor pitfalls, nor sorrows, nor childish joys. Love, for example, is a priesthood; reproduction, a ritual. Since life is the greatest benefit the universe can bestow, and there is no beggar who does not prefer poverty to death (which is itself a delightful influx of Humanitas), it follows that the transmission of life, far from being an occasion for gallanting, is the supreme hour of a spiritual Mass. Hence there is truly only one misfortune in life: never being born.",20,RO005TR06
2961,1331,"“Imagine, for example, that I had never been born,” Quincas Borba went on. “I would certainly not have the pleasure of speaking to you now, eating this potato, going to the theater . . . in a word, living. Note that I do not make man a simple vehicle for Humanitas; no, he is at the same time the vehicle, coachman, and passenger; he is Humanitas itself in miniature; hence the need to adore oneself. Would you like proof of the superiority of my system? Consider envy. There is no moralist, Greek or Turk, Christian or Muslim, who does not rail against the sentiment of envy. They are in perfect accord, from the fields of Edom to the heights of Tijuca.",20,RO005TR06
2962,1332,"See here; leave off old prejudices, forget all the frayed rhetoric, and study envy, that subtle and noble sentiment. If each man is Humanitas in miniature, clearly no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, despite appearances to the contrary. Thus, for example, the hangman who executes a condemned man may arouse the vain lamentations of the poets; but concretely, this is Humanitas correcting in Humanitas an infraction of the law of Humanitas. I would say the same of an individual who disembowels another; this is a manifestation of the strength of Humanitas. Nothing stands in the way of his being disemboweled in turn (and there are examples of this). If you have understood well, then you will easily comprehend that envy is nothing but an admiration that struggles, and since struggle is the highest function of the human race, bellicose sentiments are those most suitable to its happiness. It follows then that envy is a virtue.”",20,RO005TR06
2963,1333,,20,RO005TR06
2964,1334,"Why deny it? I was stupefied. The clarity of his explanation, the logic of his principles, the rigor of his deductions, all of it seemed supremely grand, and I had to suspend the conversation for a few minutes while I digested the new philosophy. Quincas Borba could barely hide his satisfaction at this triumph. There was a chicken wing on his plate, and he gnawed on it with philosophical serenity. I posed a few objections, flimsy ones, which he took little time to dismantle.",20,RO005TR06
2965,1335,"“To understand my system properly,” he concluded, “one must never forget the universal principle, which is divided and epitomized in each man. Look: war, which seems a calamity, is a useful operation, which we might call Humanitas cracking its knuckles; hunger (at this he sucked philosophically on the chicken wing), hunger is a test to which Humanitas sets its very entrails. But I need no more demonstration of the sublimity of my system than this very chicken.",20,RO005TR06
2966,1336,"It fed on corn, which was planted by an African—imported from Angola, let’s say. That African was born, grew up, and was sold; a ship brought him here, a ship built from wood cut down in the forest by some ten or twelve men, borne on sails sewn by some eight or ten men, to say nothing of the rigging and other elements of the nautical apparatus. Thus, this chicken, which I have just had for lunch, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles, executed with the sole aim of checkmating my hunger.”",20,RO005TR06
2967,1337,"Between the cheese and the coffee, Quincas Borba demonstrated to me that his system meant the destruction of pain. Pain, according to Humanitism, is an utter illusion. When a child is threatened with a stick, even before it is beaten, it closes its eyes and trembles; this predisposition is the foundation of an illusion, which is inherited and transmitted. Adopting the system is certainly not enough to do away with pain at once, but it is essential; the rest is the natural evolution of things. Once man is quite persuaded that he is Humanitas itself, he has only to turn his thoughts back to the original substance to ward off any painful sensation. The evolution is so profound, however, that it may easily take a few thousand years.",20,RO005TR06
2968,1338,"Some days later, Quincas Borba read to me his great masterwork. It spanned four large manuscript volumes, a hundred pages each, written in a small hand and peppered with Latin citations. The last volume was a political treatise founded on Humanitism; this was possibly the most tedious part of the system, albeit conceived with formidable logical rigor.",20,RO005TR06
2969,1339,"If society were reorganized around his method, it would not eliminate war, insurrection, a simple beating, an anonymous knife blow, misery, hunger, or disease; but since these purported scourges were errors in comprehension, for they were nothing but external movements of the same inner substance, destined to have no influence on man beyond a break in the monotony of the universe, of course their existence would be no impediment to human happiness.",20,RO005TR06
2970,1340,"Moreover, even if such scourges (a radically false notion at that) might eventually correspond to the narrow-minded concept of times past, this likewise would fail to destroy the system, and for two motives: 1st, because the substance of Humanitas holds the absolute power of creation, each individual ought to find it the greatest delight in the world to sacrifice himself to the principle from which he descends; and 2nd, because not even this would diminish the spiritual power of man over the earth, which was invented solely for his recreation, along with the stars, breezes, dates, and rhubarb.

I prepared myself to accept everything, even a connection to Damasceno. Childless!",20,RO005TR06
2995,1365,"Since by then I placed great trust in Quincas Borba, I went to him and laid out my paternal stirrings.

2998,1368,"After three months’ time, everything was going marvelously. The fluid, Sabina, the girl’s eyes, and her father’s desires were among so many other forces leading me to marriage. The memory of Virgília appeared from time to time at the door, and a black devil would thrust a mirror in my face, showing her off in the distance, dissolved into tears; but another devil would come, a pink one, with a mirror reflecting the image of Nhã-loló: tender, luminous, and angelic.",20,RO005TR06
2999,1369,"I’ll say nothing of my years. I felt them not; what’s more, I’ll add that I had cast them aside one certain Sunday when I went to Mass at the chapel on Livramento Hill.1 Since Damasceno lived in Cajueiros, I often went with his family to Mass. The hill was still bare of residences, save the old mansion atop it, where the chapel was. Well, one Sunday, as I was heading down with Nhã-loló on my arm, some phenomenon caused me to begin shedding two years here, four years there, then five a short while ahead, such that by the time I reached the bottom I was only twenty years old, just as sprightly as I had been then.",20,RO005TR06
3000,1370,"Now, if you would like to know under what circumstances the phenomenon occurred, you have only to read the chapter to the end. We were coming from Mass: she, her father, and I. Midway down the slope we came across a group of men. Damasceno, who was walking by our side, saw what it was and rushed ahead, overjoyed; we went after him. What we saw was this: men of all ages, sizes, and colors, some in shirtsleeves, others in jackets, others thrust into tattered overcoats; a range of postures, some squatting, others with their hands on their knees, the latter sitting on stones, the former leaning against a wall, all with their eyes fixed on the center, their souls leaning out of their pupils.",20,RO005TR06
3001,1371,“What is it?” Nhã-loló asked me.,20,RO005TR06
3002,1372,"I motioned for her to be silent; I gently opened up a path, and all gave way, without a single one seeing me. Their eyes had been trussed to the center. It was a cockfight. I saw the two contenders, two cocks with sharp spurs, eyes of fire, and cutting beaks. Both shook their bloody crests; their breasts were scarlet and plucked clean, and fatigue was overcoming the both of them. But they fought on, their eyes locked, beak down, beak up, a blow from one, a blow from the other, trembling and furious. Nothing else existed for Damasceno; for him, the spectacle had blotted out the universe. In vain did I tell him that it was time for us to go down; he did not respond, he did not hear; he was given over to the duel. Cockfighting was one of his passions.",20,RO005TR06
3003,1373,"Just then, Nhã-loló tugged gently on my arm, saying that we should go. I accepted this counsel and headed down with her. I had said that the hill had no other houses back then; I had also told you that we were coming from Mass, and since I did not tell you that it was raining, the day was, of course, fair, with a delightful sun. And a strong one. So strong that I soon opened up the parasol, grasped it high up the handle, and turned it at such an angle as to add a page to the philosophy of Quincas Borba: Humanitas osculated Humanitas . . . And that was how the years went falling off as I came downhill.",20,RO005TR06
3004,1374,"We lingered a few minutes at the foot of the hill, awaiting Damasceno; he arrived soon thereafter, surrounded by the bettors and discussing the details of the fight. One of them, the stakeholder, was handing out ragged ten-tostão notes to the doubly gleeful winners. As for the cocks, they were under their respective owners’ arms. One of them had his crest so mangled and bloodied that I believed him to be the loser; but I was mistaken—the loser had no crest whatsoever. Both had their beaks open, panting, bone-tired. The bettors, for their part, were contented, despite the heat of the fight; they sketched biographies of the contenders, recalling the feats of both. I walked on, discomfited; Nhã-loló, mortified.",20,RO005TR06

3006,1376,A VERY FINE INTENTION,20,RO005TR06
3007,1377,"What mortified Nhã-loló was her father. The ease with which he had fallen in with the bettors had thrown old habits and social affinities into relief, and Nhã-loló had come to fear that I might find him an unworthy father-in-law. The way she set herself apart was remarkable; she studied herself and she studied me. Elegant, refined life attracted her, principally because it struck her as the most reliable means by which to make us suit one another. Nhã-loló would observe, imitate, and infer; at the same time, she dedicated herself to masking her family’s inferiority. On that day, however, her father manifested it so extravagantly that she was saddened to no end. I sought to distract her from the matter with jests and gentle witticisms; all in vain, for they no longer lifted her spirits. Her distress was so profound, her dejection so expressive, that I came to see in Nhã-loló the positive intention to separate her cause from that of her father in my eyes. This sentiment struck me as superiorly elevated; it was yet another affinity between us.",20,RO005TR06

3010,1380,THE REAL COTRIM,20,RO005TR06
3011,1381,"Despite my forty-odd years, I believed that I should not propose the marriage before first speaking with Cotrim, for I prized family harmony. He heard me out and responded gravely that he would not opine on the affairs of his relatives. He might be suspected of harboring some interest if he were to praise Nhã-loló’s rare talents; he would thus be silent. What’s more, though he was convinced that his niece bore a true passion for me, if she were to consult him he would counsel against the match. This was not out of any bad feeling; he appreciated my virtues and never tired of praising them, as was only fair; and as for Nhã-loló, he would never deny that she would make an excellent bride; but between there and counseling marriage lay an abyss.",20,RO005TR06
3012,1382,"“I wash my hands of it entirely,” he concluded.",20,RO005TR06
3013,1383,“But you said the other day that I should be married as soon as possible . . .”,20,RO005TR06
3014,1384,"“That’s another matter. I do believe that marriage is indispensable, especially for those with political ambitions. You must know that in politics, bachelordom is a hindrance. But as for the bride, I can have no say, nor do I wish to, nor ought I, even if it were my place, which it is not. From what she has told me, it seems that Sabina overstepped herself, making certain confidences to you; but in any case she is not a blood relative of Nhã-loló’s, as I am. Look . . . but no . . . I won’t say that . . .”",20,RO005TR06

3016,1386,“No; I won’t say anything.”,20,RO005TR06
3017,1387,"Cotrim’s scruples may seem excessive to those unaware that he possessed a ferociously honorable character. I myself treated him unfairly during the years after my father’s estate was settled. I recognize now that he was a paragon. People accused him of avarice, and I believe they were right; but avarice is nothing more than the exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues should be like budgets: better a surplus than a deficit. Since he had a brusque way about him, he had enemies, and they went so far as to accuse him of savagery.",20,RO005TR06
3018,1388,"The only thing they alleged on this score was that he often sent slaves to the Dungeon, from which they would descend streaming with blood; but, apart from the fact that he only sent runaways and incorrigibles, it so happens that, having dealt for so long in the smuggling of slaves, he had become somewhat used to the slightly harsher treatment required by that sort of business, and one cannot honestly attribute to a man’s original nature that which is the pure effect of social relations.",20,RO005TR06
3019,1389,"The proof that Cotrim harbored pious sentiments was to be found in his love of his children and in the pain he suffered when Sara died a few months later; an irrefutable proof, say I, and hardly the only one. He was the treasurer of a fraternal order, and a member of several religious societies, even a perpetual brother in one of them, which hardly fits with his reputation as a miser; although the truth is that this charity had its own benefits: the brotherhood (of which he had been a board member) had an oil portrait painted of him.",20,RO005TR06
3020,1390,,20,RO005TR06
3021,1391,"He was not perfect, certainly; he had the fault of sending notes to the newspapers about this or that charitable act of his—a reprehensible fault, or at least not one to be lauded, I agree; but he excused himself by saying that good deeds were contagious when made public, an argument to which one cannot deny some weight. I truly believe (and in this I see his greatest merit) that he practiced these occasional charitable acts only with the aim of arousing the philanthropy of others; and if this was his intention, one must admit that publicity was a sine qua non. In short, he might have owed a few courtesies to some, but he didn’t owe a cent to a single soul.",20,RO005TR06

You are hereby informed that she died; and I will add that it was on the occasion of the first outbreak of yellow fever.1 I shall say nothing more, except that I accompanied her to her final rest, and that I bade her farewell with sorrow, but without tears.

I believe that it struck me as even more absurd than all the rest. But Quincas Borba explained to me that epidemics were useful for the species, albeit disastrous for a certain number of individuals; he had me observe that, as horrendous as the spectacle was, there was a considerable advantage: the survival of the greatest number. He even asked me if, amidst the general mourning, I didn’t feel some secret delight in having escaped the clutches of the plague; but this question was so senseless that it was left unanswered.",20,RO005TR06

Twelve people, no more, and three-quarters of them Cotrim’s friends, had accompanied his dear daughter’s body to the grave. And he had sent out eighty invitations.

3048,1418,"Indeed, an ordinary man who heard those last words of Damasceno’s would not remember them when, some time later, he happened to look at a picture of six Turkish ladies. Well, I remembered them. These were six ladies of Constantinople—modern ladies—in their street garb, faces hidden, not with a thick fabric that would truly cover them, but with the slightest of veils, which made as if to reveal only the eyes, when it truly revealed the entire face.",20,RO005TR06
3049,1419,"And I was amused by the cleverness of this Muslim coquettishness, which so hides the face—fulfilling its purpose—but fails to hide it—and thus exposes its beauty. Apparently there is nothing to connect the Turkish ladies to Damasceno; but if you are a profound and penetrating soul (and I very much doubt that you will deny me that), you will understand that in both cases, we are beholding the tip of the ear of a gentle but inflexible companion of man in society . . .",20,RO005TR06
3050,1420,"Sweet Formality, you are the great staff of life, the balm of the heart, the peacemaker between men, the bond between earth and heaven; you dry a father’s tears, you win the indulgence of a Prophet. If pain is ever to abate, and a conscience ever to conform, to whom but you do they owe that tremendous gift? When esteem goes by with hat undoffed, it says nothing to the soul; but indifference, courting it with kind words, leaves a delightful impression. The reason is that, contrary to an old, absurd formula, the letter does not kill; the letter gives life; the spirit is the object of controversy and doubt, interpretation, and thus struggles of life and death. Long live you, sweet Formality, in the name of Damasceno’s peace and Mohammed’s glory.",20,RO005TR06

For those who have been reading along in this book, there is no need to play up my satisfaction; and for the rest it is equally useless. I was a deputy, and I saw the Turkish picture, leaning back in my chair between one colleague who was telling an anecdote and another who was sketching a portrait of the orator in pencil on the back of an envelope.

But just as I have no chemist’s instruments, I had no remorse; I had a mind to be minister of state. If I must finish out this chapter, I will say that I would rather be neither Achilles nor Lady Macbeth; if forced to choose, I would prefer Achilles, rather go about in triumph with the body than bear the spot; that way, at least, one hears Priam’s pleas and gains a handsome military and literary reputation.

She wore a magnificent dress of blue grogram, and bared the same shoulders of yesteryear to the light. This was not the bloom of her first youth—quite the contrary—but she was still beautiful, an autumnal beauty heightened by the evening. I recall that we spoke at length without alluding to anything of the past. Everything was understood. A glancing, vague turn of phrase, or a gaze, and nothing more. Soon thereafter, she left; I watched her go down the stairs, and, by I know not which phenomenon of cerebral ventriloquism (may the philologists pardon me for that barbarous construction), I murmured this profoundly retrospective remark:",20,RO005TR06

3071,1441,"The reason for this difference is that women (except in certain cases, such as the situation in Chapter CI) give themselves over to love—that is, Stendhal’s passionate love, or the purely physical love of certain Roman ladies, for example, or women among the Polynesians, Laplanders, Kaffirs, and perhaps other civilized races as well; but men—I speak of men in cultured, elegant society—men yoke their vanity to the aforementioned sentiment.",20,RO005TR06

3073,1443,"Whether my explanation is true or not, I am content to leave it written on this page, for the use of the ages, that women’s indiscretion is a sham invented by men; in love, at least, they are veritable sepulchers. They are, however, often brought to ruin by clumsiness, or restlessness, or failing to resist gestures or gazes; and that is why a great lady and a fine spirit, the Queen of Navarre, once employed the following metaphor to say that every amorous adventure would be found out, sooner or later: “There is no little dog so well trained that it cannot be heard to bark.”1",20,RO005TR06

3079,1449,"We were at the point at which the naval officer had just extracted a confession from me about my affair with Virgília, and here I will correct Helvétius’s principle1—or, rather, explain it. It was in my interest to remain silent; to confirm suspicions of an old affair would be to awaken some slumbering hatred, give rise to a scandal, or at the very least acquire a reputation as indiscreet. Such were my interests; and a superficial reading of Helvétius’s principle would indicate that, accordingly, I ought to have fallen silent. But I have already presented the mainspring of masculine indiscretion; ahead of the interest posed by safety, there was another, that of vanity, which is more intimate and more immediate: the first was reflective, and supposed a preceding syllogism, while the second was spontaneous, instinctive, and sprang from the entrails; finally, the first had a remote effect, and the second, a direct one. Conclusion: Helvétius’s principle held true in my case—the difference is that the interest in question was not apparent, but hidden.",20,RO005TR06

3082,1452,"I have not told you yet—but I’ll tell you now—that when Virgília went down the stairs and the naval officer touched me on the shoulder, I was fifty years old. My life itself, therefore, was heading down the stairs; or the best part of it, at least, a part full of pleasure, agitations, and frights—cloaked in deception and duplicity—but the best part of it, in the end, if we must speak in ordinary language. If, however, we employ another, more sublime language, then the best part was that which remained, as I will have the honor of telling you in the few pages left in this book.",20,RO005TR06
3083,1453,"Fifty years old! There was no need to confess it, really. You’ll already have noticed that my style is no longer so nimble as in its first days. On that occasion, after my dialogue with the naval officer, who put on his cloak and left, I’ll confess that I grew somewhat sad. I returned to the salon, where it occurred to me to dance a polka and be intoxicated by the lights, the flowers, the crystals, the pretty eyes, and the light hum of private conversations. And I do not regret it; I grew young again. But half an hour later, when I retired from the ball at four in the morning, what did I find in the back of my carriage? My fifty years. There they were, the stubborn things, neither numbed with cold nor stiff with rheumatism, but dozing away their weariness, rather anxious for a bed and repose. Then—behold just how far the imagination of a drowsy man can go—then I seemed to hear this, from a bat perched on the roof of the coach: Mr. Brás Cubas, your rejuvenation lay in the hall, in the crystals, the lights, the silks—that is, in others.",20,RO005TR06

3085,1455,OBLIVION,20,RO005TR06
3086,1456,"And now I feel that if any lady has made it this far, she will close the book and never read the rest. For her, the only interesting part of my life, which was love, has been snuffed out. Fifty years old! Not yet infirmity, but no longer vigor. Let another ten come, and I shall understand what an Englishman once said; I will understand “what it is to find none who can remember my parents, and with what a face OBLIVION will look upon me.”1",20,RO005TR06
3087,1457,"Let the name be printed in small capitals. OBLIVION! It is only right that all due honor be given to a figure so despised and so worthy, that tardy but unfailing guest. The lady who shone at the dawn of the current monarchy feels his presence, but it is all the more painful for she who flaunted her blooming charms under the administration of the Marquis of Paraná, for her triumph is closer at hand, and she may be given to feeling that her rivals have stolen her carriage.",20,RO005TR06
3088,1458,"If she is worthy of herself, she will not persist in trying to stir that lifeless or dying memory; she does not seek in today’s gaze the same warmth of yesterday’s, when those setting out on the march of life were others, their souls gay and their feet swift. Tempora mutantur. She understands the nature of the whirlwind, which carries off the leaves from the grove and the rags from the road, saving none and pitying none; and if she has a shred of philosophy in her, she will not envy, but rather grieve for those who have stolen her carriage, as they, too, will be helped to dismount by that unflagging footman OBLIVION.

3093,1463,THE SHAKO,20,RO005TR06
3094,1464,"And then again, no; it sums up exactly what I reflected on the following day to Quincas Borba, to which I added that I felt dejected, and a thousand other sad things. But the philosopher, with his superior judgment, bellowed at me that I was slipping down the fatal slope of melancholy.",20,RO005TR06
3095,1465,"“My dear Brás Cubas, don’t let yourself be overcome by these vapors. The deuce! You must be a man! Be strong! Fight! Win! Shine! Influence! Dominate! Fifty is the age for wisdom and government. Take heart, Brás Cubas; don’t go soft. What have you to do with the passage from ruin to ruin, flower to flower? You must try to savor life; and know that the worst philosophy is that of the sniveler who lies on the riverbank to bemoan the never-ending flow of the waters. It is their business to never come to rest; come to terms with that law, and try to make the most of it.”",20,RO005TR06
3096,1466,"The authority of a great philosopher is felt in the smallest things. Quincas Borba’s words had the magic effect of shaking me out of my mental and moral torpor. Let’s have at it; govern we will, it’s high time. Until then, I had not intervened in the great debates. I had been courting a minister’s position through bowing and scraping, teas, commissions, and votes; and the position had not come. I would have to seize the rostrum.",20,RO005TR06
3097,1467,"I started slowly. Three days later, during a discussion on the budget for the Ministry of Justice, I took the opportunity to ask the minister modestly if he didn’t think it wise to reduce the size of the National Guard’s shakos. The object of the question was not of a great scale, but even so, I demonstrated that it was not unworthy of the cogitations of a statesman; and I cited Philopoemen, who ordered that his troops’ bucklers be replaced with larger shields and their spears with heavier pikes, a fact that history did not find unbefitting the gravity of its pages.",20,RO005TR06
3098,1468,"Our shakos were in need of a profound trimming, not only because they were inelegant but also because they were unhygienic. Out on parades, under the sun, the excessive heat they produced might prove fatal. Given that one of Hippocrates’ precepts was to keep one’s head cool, it seemed callous to force a citizen to risk his health and life, and hence the future of his family, out of purely sartorial considerations.",20,RO005TR06
3099,1469,"The Chamber and the administration ought to recall that the National Guard was the bulwark of liberty and independence, and that citizens called to a service that was freely bestowed, habitual, and arduous were entitled to have their burden lessened by the establishment of a light and comfortable uniform.",20,RO005TR06
3100,1470,,20,RO005TR06
3101,1471,"I added that the weight of the shako was casting citizens’ heads down, and the nation needed men whose brows might rise, proud and serene, in the face of power; and I concluded with this idea: the weeping willow, which bends its branches toward the earth, grows in cemeteries; the palm, erect and steadfast, grows in the wilderness, in public squares, and in gardens.",20,RO005TR06
3102,1472,"The speech was variously received. As for its form, its bursts of eloquence, the literary and philosophical elements, the opinion was unanimous: they all told me that it was perfect, and that no one had ever pulled so many ideas out of a shako. But many judged the political part of it deplorable; some called it a parliamentary disaster; in the end, I got word that others already counted me in the ranks of the opposition, among them the oppositionists in the Chamber, who went so far as to insinuate that a motion of no confidence might be in order.",20,RO005TR06
3103,1473,"I forcefully repudiated this interpretation, which was not merely erroneous, but also slanderous, my support for the cabinet being known to all; I added that the need to reduce the shako was not so great that it could not wait some years; and that in any case, I had reached a compromise on the extent of the cut, contenting myself with three-quarters of an inch, or even less; finally, even if my idea were not to be adopted, I was satisfied with simply having introduced it in debate.",20,RO005TR06

3105,1475,"“I am not a man of politics,” he told me at supper; “I can’t say whether you acted wisely or not; but I do know that you delivered an excellent speech.”",20,RO005TR06
3106,1476,"And then he recalled the most striking parts, the beautiful images, the robust arguments, with the measured praise that so befits a great philosopher; then he took the issue to heart and impugned the shako with such force and lucidity that he wound up wholly convincing me of the danger it posed.",20,RO005TR06

I do not mean that I am older now than when I began the book. Death does not age one. What I do mean is that at every stage of the narration of my life, I experience the corresponding sensations.

3119,1489,WHICH EXPLAINS THE PREVIOUS,20,RO005TR06
3120,1490,"Some things are better said by falling silent; this is the case with the previous chapter. Those with dashed ambitions of their own may comprehend it. If the passion for power is the strongest of all, as some have said, then imagine my despair, pain, and dejection on the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies. All my hopes abandoned me; my political career was at an end. And mark that Quincas Borba, through philosophical inductions, concluded that my ambition was not a true passion for power but merely a whim, a desire to amuse myself.",20,RO005TR06
3121,1491,"In his opinion, this sentiment, while not more profound, is much more bothersome, on par with women’s love of lace and finery. Cromwells or Bonapartes, he added, those who positively burn with the passion for power, will get there by force, by hook or by crook. I did not share that sentiment; my sentiment, lacking their strength, lacked their certainty of result; hence my greater affliction, disenchantment, and sorrow. My sentiment, according to Humanitism . . .",20,RO005TR06
3122,1492,"“The devil with you and your Humanitism,” I broke in. “I’m fed up with philosophies that get me nowhere.”",20,RO005TR06
3123,1493,"The harshness of this interruption, given the stature of the philosopher, was as good as an affront; but he forgave the irritation with which I spoke to him. Coffee was brought in; it was one o’clock in the afternoon, and we were in my study, a handsome study overlooking the grounds, with good books and objets d’art, a Voltaire among them, a bronze Voltaire whose sarcastic smirk seemed all the sharper as he looked on me just then, the scoundrel; excellent chairs; outside there was the sun, a tremendous sun, which Quincas Borba—either poking fun or poetizing, I don’t know—referred to as one of the ministers of nature; a cool breeze was blowing, and the sky was blue.",20,RO005TR06
3124,1494,"In each window—there were three—there hung a cage with birds, chirruping a rustic opera. All bore the appearance of a conspiracy of things against man: and, though I was in my study, looking at my grounds, sitting in my chair, listening to my birds, next to my books, illuminated by my sun, none of it was enough to cure me of my longing for that other chair, which was not mine.",20,RO005TR06

3127,1497,"“Well, what do you intend to do now?” Quincas Borba asked me, going to rest his empty coffee cup on a windowsill.",20,RO005TR06
3128,1498,"“I don’t know; I’ll hide my head in Tijuca; I’ll flee from men. I’m ashamed, I’m disgusted. So many dreams, my dear Borba, so many dreams, and I’m nothing.”",20,RO005TR06
3129,1499,“Nothing!” Quincas Borba interrupted with a look of indignation.,20,RO005TR06
3130,1500,"To distract me, he invited me out, and we headed over toward Engenho Velho. We went on foot, philosophizing away. I shall never forget the good that walk did me. The words of that great man were a cordial of wisdom. He told me that I could not flee from combat; if the rostrum was closed to me, it was incumbent upon me to open a newspaper. He even used a less elevated expression, thus showing that philosophical language might fortify itself with the slang of the streets. Found a newspaper, he told me, and “bust up their little racket.”",20,RO005TR06
3131,1501,"“A magnificent idea! I’ll found a newspaper, I’ll tear them apart, I’ll . . .”",20,RO005TR06
3132,1502,"“Fight. Maybe you’ll tear them apart, maybe you won’t, what’s essential is that you fight. To live is to fight. A life without struggle is a dead sea at the heart of the universal organism.”",20,RO005TR06
3133,1503,"A bit farther on, we came across a dogfight, an incident with no significance to the eye of a common man. Quincas Borba had me stop and observe the dogs. There were two of them. He noted that nearby was a bone, the motive for the war, and further called my attention to the fact that the bone had no meat on it. A plain, bare bone. The dogs were biting one another, growling, with fury in their eyes . . . Quincas Borba put his walking-stick under his arm, seemingly in ecstasy.",20,RO005TR06
3134,1504,“How beautiful it is!” he said from time to time.,20,RO005TR06
3135,1505,"I wanted to tear myself away, but I couldn’t; he was rooted to the ground, and began walking again only when the fight ceased entirely and one of the dogs, bitten and defeated, went to take its hunger elsewhere. I noted that he was sincerely joyful, although he contained that joy, as befitted a great philosopher. He had me observe the beauty of the spectacle, recalled the object of the struggle, and concluded that the dogs were hungry; but the privation of sustenance meant nothing in the grand scope of philosophy. Nor did he neglect to mention that in some parts of the globe the spectacle is even grander: human creatures are the ones struggling with the dogs for bones and other, less appetizing morsels; a struggle that becomes infinitely more complicated, as man’s intelligence enters into it, with all the wisdom he has accumulated over the ages, et cetera.",20,RO005TR06

3138,1508,"“What a multitude of things there are in a minuet!”1 as someone once said. What a multitude of things there are in a dogfight! But I was no servile or fearful disciple, loath to make a reasonable objection here or there. As we walked, I said that a doubt had arisen in my mind; the advantage to be had in fighting over food with dogs was not quite clear. He responded with exceptional gentleness:",20,RO005TR06
3139,1509,"“Fighting over it with other men is more logical, as the contenders are of the same condition, and the bone will simply go to the strongest. But why would the spectacle be any less grand were we to fight with dogs over a bone? There are those who voluntarily eat grasshoppers, like the Precursor, or worse, like Ezekiel;2 it follows that bad things are edible; what remains to be seen is whether it is worthier for a man to fight for them out of a natural need or to prefer to do so in obedience to an exaltation that is religious, and hence modifiable, whereas hunger is eternal, like life and like death.”",20,RO005TR06
3140,1510,"We had reached the door of my house; I was given a letter and told that it had come from a lady. We went in, and Quincas Borba, with his philosopher’s discretion, went off to read the spines of the books in one of the bookcases while I read the letter, which was from Virgília:",20,RO005TR06

I turned the paper over, and over again. Poor Dona Plácida! But I had left her the five thousand milréis from Botafogo Beach, and I could not understand how . . .",20,RO005TR06

3147,1517,"“What?” I asked, startled.",20,RO005TR06
3148,1518,"“You’ll understand that I’ve only told you the truth. Pascal is one of my spiritual grandfathers; and though my philosophy is worth more than his, I cannot deny that he was a great man. Now, what does he say on this page?” And, hat on head, walking-stick under his arm, he pointed out the line with a finger. “What does he say? He says that man has ‘a great advantage over the rest of the universe: he knows that he dies, while the universe knows nothing of it.’ You see? The man who fights over a bone with a dog thus has a great advantage over it, that of knowing that he is hungry; and this is what makes the struggle grand, as I was saying.",20,RO005TR06
3149,1519,"‘He knows that he dies’ is a profound expression; and yet I believe that mine is profounder still: he knows that he is hungry. For the fact of death, we might say, limits human understanding; the awareness of extinction lasts but a brief moment and ends forevermore, while hunger has the advantage of returning and prolonging our conscious state. It seems to me (if there’s no immodesty in saying so) that Pascal’s formula is inferior to mine, although it does remain a great thought, and Pascal, a great man.”",20,RO005TR06

3154,1524,“Yes.”,20,RO005TR06
3155,1525,"Indeed, I was quite vexed, bothered by Virgília’s request. I had given Dona Plácida five thousand milréis; I highly doubted that anyone could be more generous than I was, even close to it. Five thousand! And what had she done with them? She’d thrown them away, of course, squandered them on great parties, and now it was off to the Misericórdia, and I was to take her! A body may die anywhere at all. Besides, I didn’t know if I remembered where this Escadinhas Alley was; but to judge by the name, it was probably some cramped, dark corner of the city.1 I’d have to go there, be the object of the neighbors’ attention, knock on doors, et cetera.

The next day I had her moved to the Misericórdia, where she died a week later. That’s not quite it: morning found her dead; she left life furtively, just as she had entered it. Once again I asked myself, as I had in Chapter LXXV, if it was for this that the sacristan at the See and the sweetmaker had brought Dona Plácida into the world, in a moment of particular good feeling. But I soon realized that were it not for Dona Plácida, my affair with Virgília might have been interrupted or broken off entirely in its full bloom; hence, that was what Dona Plácida’s life was good for.

3166,1536,"It was high time to found the newspaper. I drew up the prospectus, which was a political application of Humanitism; but since Quincas Borba had yet to publish his book (which he was perfecting year by year), we agreed to make no reference to it. Quincas Borba requested only a signed, confidential declaration that certain new principles applied to politics had been taken from his manuscript.",20,RO005TR06
3167,1537,"This was the cream of prospectuses; it promised to heal society, destroy abuses, and defend sound principles of liberty and conservation; it appealed to commerce and agriculture; it quoted Guizot and Ledru-Rollin; and it finished with this threat, which Quincas Borba found small-minded and narrow: “The new doctrine which we profess must inevitably overturn the present administration.” I must confess that, under the political circumstances, the prospectus seemed a masterpiece to me. As for the threat at the end, which Quincas Borba found small-minded, I demonstrated to him that it was saturated with the purest Humanitism, as he himself would confess some time later.",20,RO005TR06
3168,1538,"Humanitism excluded nothing; Napoleon’s wars and a scuffle between nanny goats were, according to our doctrine, equally sublime, with the difference that Napoleon’s soldiers knew it when they died, something that apparently does not happen with nanny goats. I was doing nothing more than applying our philosophical formula to the prevailing circumstances: Humanitas wished to substitute Humanitas for the welfare of Humanitas.",20,RO005TR06
3169,1539,"“My beloved disciple, my caliph,” cried Quincas Borba, with a note of tenderness that I had not heard in him before. “I may now say, as the great Mohammed did: were the sun and moon to be set against me, I would not abandon my ideas.1 You must believe, my dear Brás Cubas, that this is the everlasting truth, older than worlds, which will outlive the ages.”",20,RO005TR06

Quincas Borba, to whom I read the note, took up the pen and, in a spirit of truly humanistic brotherhood, added the following after my name: “one of the most glorious members of the last Chamber.”",20,RO005TR06
3173,1543,"The following day, Cotrim came by my house. He was somewhat disturbed but disguised it, striving to look calm, even cheery. He had seen the note in the paper and thought that he should, as a friend and relative, dissuade me from such a notion. It was an error, a fatal error. He explained that I would be placing myself in a difficult situation, and, one way or another, shutting the door to Parliament.",20,RO005TR06
3174,1544,"Not only was this a positively admirable administration—about which I might very well disagree—but, moreover, it would certainly have a long life; what could I gain by indisposing it against me?

I went so far as to suggest that he read the prospectus, but he refused forcefully, saying that he wanted to have not the slightest part in my foolishness.",20,RO005TR06

3178,1548,"I explained that it would not befit me to beg for a chair in Parliament, and that my idea was to overturn the administration, for I thought it was no match for the challenges of the day—not to mention that it was out of line with a certain philosophical formula. I assured her that I would always employ a courteous, though forceful tone. Violence was not a seasoning that pleased my palate. Sabina tapped her fan on the tips of her fingers, shook her head, and returned to the matter, alternating between supplication and threats; I told her no, no, and no. Disabused of her hopes, she accused me of preferring the counsel of jealous strangers to hers and her husband’s.",20,RO005TR06

3182,1552,THE INSOLUBLE PROBLEM,20,RO005TR06
3183,1553,"I published the newspaper. Twenty-four hours later, there appeared in other papers a declaration from Cotrim, the substance of which was that as he was not a member of any of the parties into which the nation was divided, he thought it expedient to make it clearly known that he had no influence or any part, direct or indirect, in the newspaper of his brother-in-law, Dr. Brás Cubas, whose ideas and political comportment he repudiated entirely. The current administration (as well as any other composed of equal talents, for that matter) seemed to him perfectly apt to promote the public good.",20,RO005TR06
3184,1554,"I could not believe my eyes. I rubbed them once, twice, and reread this extraordinary, inopportune, wholly enigmatic declaration. If he had nothing to do with the parties, then what was something as ordinary as the publication of a newspaper to him? Not every citizen who finds an administration good or bad takes it upon himself to make declarations of the sort in the press, nor is he obliged to. Cotrim’s intruding on the matter was truly a mystery, and his personal aggression toward me not less so. Our relations had been plain and good-natured; I could think of no discord, no shadow, nothing after the reconciliation.",20,RO005TR06
3185,1555,"On the contrary, my recollections were of nothing but kindnesses; for example, when I was a deputy, I was able to obtain contracts for him with the Navy Arsenal, contracts that he continued fulfilling with the greatest punctuality, and which, he had told me a few weeks earlier, might earn him some two hundred thousand milréis in another three years’ time. Was the memory of such a kindness powerless to keep him from publicly affronting his brother-in-law? The reason for the declaration must have been quite compelling, leading him as it did to both intemperance and ingratitude; I confess that it posed an insoluble problem . . .",20,RO005TR06

3189,1559,“Good riddance!” he concluded; “not every problem is worth five minutes of attention.”,20,RO005TR06
3190,1560,"As for the charge of ingratitude, Quincas Borba rejected it entirely, not on the grounds of its improbability, but as wholly absurd, for it did not follow the conclusions of a good humanistic philosophy.",20,RO005TR06
3191,1561,"“You cannot deny me one fact,” he said, “which is that the pleasure of the benefiter is always greater than that of the beneficiary. What is a benefit? It is an act that causes some privation on the part of the beneficiary to cease. Once the essential effect is produced—that is, once the privation has indeed ceased—the organism returns to its previous state of indifference. Suppose you have tightened your waistband too far; to make the discomfort cease, you loosen it, breathe, savor an instant of pleasure, your organism returns to indifference, and you no longer think of your fingers, which carried out the act.",20,RO005TR06
3192,1562,"Just as nothing lasts, so it is natural that memory should fade; it is no air plant, it needs soil in which to root. The expectation of other favors, of course, will always preserve the beneficiary’s recollection of the first; but this fact, which is, incidentally, one of the most sublime that philosophy may have the opportunity to observe, can be explained by the memory of privation—or, to use another formula, by the privation that continues in memory, echoing that past pain and advising that an opportune remedy be kept at hand. I’ll not deny that, even in the absence of such a thing, the memory of the kindness may at times persist, accompanied by a degree of affection; but these are true aberrations, with no value in the eyes of a philosopher.”",20,RO005TR06
3193,1563,"“But,” I replied, “if there is no reason for the memory of the kindness to last in the mind of he who receives it, there must be even less reason for it to linger with the bestower. I wish you would explain that point.”",20,RO005TR06
3194,1564,"“One doesn’t explain that which is evident by nature,” retorted Quincas Borba; “but I’ll say one thing more. The persistence of the benefit in the memory of he who practices it may be explained by the very nature of the benefit and its effects. First, there is a sentiment of a good deed, and by deduction the awareness that we are capable of good deeds; second, one enjoys the conviction that one is superior to another creature, superior in state and in means; and this is one of the most legitimately pleasing things for the human organism, according to the best opinions.",20,RO005TR06
3195,1565,"Erasmus, who wrote a few good things in his Praise of Folly, called readers’ attention to the beneficence with which two donkeys scratch one another.1 Far be it from me to reject this observation of Erasmus’s; but I will say what he did not, which is that if one of the donkeys scratches the other one better, he must have a special gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.",20,RO005TR06
3196,1566,"Why does a pretty woman look in the mirror so often, if not because she finds herself to be pretty, and because this gives her a measure of superiority over a multitude of other, less pretty or positively ugly women? Conscience is the same; it contemplates itself frequently when it finds itself beautiful. Remorse is nothing but the grimace of a conscience that sees itself to be hideous. Do not forget that, since everything is a simple irradiation of Humanitas, both the benefit and its effects are perfectly admirable phenomena.”",20,RO005TR06

The first issue of my newspaper filled my soul with a vast dawn, crowned me with verdure, and gave me back the gaiety of youth. Six months later the hour of old age struck, and two weeks after that came death, which was furtive, just as Dona Plácida’s had been. On the day when morning found the newspaper dead, I sighed like a man come from a long journey.",20,RO005TR06
3200,1570,"And so if I say that human life nourishes and gives rise to other lives, which may be more or less fleeting, just as the body feeds its parasites, I believe that I will not be saying something entirely absurd. But rather than trust in a figure of speech that may prove somewhat lacking in clarity and suitability, I’ll call upon an astronomical image: in his path around the great mystery, man executes a dual maneuver of both rotation and translation; he has his days, which are as unequal as those on Jupiter, and with them he makes up his year, which may be more or less long.",20,RO005TR06
3201,1571,"Just as I was concluding my rotation, Lobo Neves was concluding his translation. He died with one foot on the ministerial step. Word had it for a few weeks that he would be a minister; and just as the rumor filled me with no end of irritation and envy, it is not impossible that the news of his death may have brought me a measure of tranquility, relief, and a minute or two of pleasure. Pleasure is a strong word, but it is true; I swear to the ages that it is the purest truth.",20,RO005TR06
3202,1572,"I went to the funeral. In the mortuary chapel I found Virgília by the coffin, sobbing. When she lifted her head, I saw that she was really crying. As the funeral procession headed out, she embraced the coffin, distraught; she had to be removed from it and taken inside. I say to you that her tears were genuine. I went to the cemetery; and, if the truth be told, I could barely bring myself to speak; I had a stone in my throat, or on my conscience. At the cemetery, principally when I tossed my spadeful of lime over the coffin down in the grave, the dull thud of the lime gave me a passing but disagreeable shudder; and all that afternoon had the weight and color of lead; the cemetery, the black clothes . . .",20,RO005TR06

I do like epitaphs; they are, among civilized folk, an expression of that secret, pious egotism that induces man to wrench from death at least a scrap of the shade that has passed on. Hence, perhaps, the inconsolable sorrow of those who have their dead in a pauper’s grave; it seems to them that the anonymous rot seeps into their own souls.",20,RO005TR06

I could not shake the funeral ceremony from my eyes, nor Virgília’s sobbing from my ears. The sobbing, in particular, had the vague and mysterious sound of a problem. Virgília had betrayed her husband in all sincerity and was now weeping for him in all sincerity. There you have a difficult combination, which I struggled to make sense of along the whole route; at home, however, as I got out of my carriage, I suspected that the combination was not merely possible but even natural. Sweet Nature! The toll of pain is like Vespasian’s coin;1 it does not smell of its origin, and may be reaped from good as well as from evil. Morality may reprehend my accomplice; but that is of no consequence to you, implacable friend, so long as you receive your tears in a timely manner. Sweet, thrice sweet Nature!",20,RO005TR06

3211,1581,"I was beginning to grow plaintive, to which I preferred sleep. I slept, dreamt that I was a nabob, and awoke wanting to be one. It often pleased me to imagine these contrasts of religion, state, and creed. A few days earlier I had pondered the hypothesis of a social, religious, and political revolution that might transform the archbishop of Canterbury into a simple tax collector in Petrópolis, and I carried out lengthy calculations to determine whether the tax collector would eliminate the archbishop, or whether the archbishop would reject the tax collector, or what portion of an archbishop may lie within a tax collector, and what share of a tax collector may suit an archbishop, et cetera. Apparently insoluble questions, but in reality they are quite soluble, once one realizes that in a single archbishop there may actually be two archbishops: the one from the bull and the other one. It’s settled, I’ll be a nabob.",20,RO005TR06
3212,1582,"It was just a joke; I told it, however, to Quincas Borba, who looked at me with no little caution and pity, and subsequently had the graciousness to inform me that I was mad. I laughed at first; but the high conviction with which the philosopher spoke frightened me somewhat. My only objection against Quincas Borba’s word was that I didn’t feel mad, but since madmen do not normally have a different opinion of themselves, this objection was rendered worthless. Now, just see if there is any fundament to the popular belief that philosophers are indifferent to the smallest matters. The next day Quincas Borba sent an alienist to examine me. I knew him and was stricken with fear. He, however, behaved with the greatest delicacy and skill, bidding me farewell so gaily that I resolved to ask if he truly did not think me mad.",20,RO005TR06
3213,1583,"“No,” he said, smiling, “few men have as much sense as you, sir.”",20,RO005TR06

3218,1588,"You may imagine my affliction. The alienist, seeing the effect of his words, recognized that I was indeed a friend of Quincas Borba’s and attempted to diminish the gravity of his diagnosis. He noted that it might come to nothing, and even added that a little dash of lunacy, far from doing any harm, gave a certain spice to life. When I rejected this opinion, horrified, the alienist smiled and said something so extraordinary, so very extraordinary, that it merits nothing less than a chapter.",20,RO005TR06

He was nothing but a poor wretch who might not even have had Diogenes’ barrel to sleep in; but the imaginary possession of those ships was worth all the drachmas in Hellas to him. Now, within every one of us there is an Athenian maniac; and anyone who swears that he has never mentally owned at least two or three schooners is certainly lying.”",20,RO005TR06

3240,1610,"It was around then that I reconciled once again with Cotrim, never having understood the cause of our differences.

Soon thereafter he invited me to join a lay brotherhood, which I did not do without first consulting Quincas Borba:",20,RO005TR06
3241,1611,"“Go, if you wish,” the latter told me, “but only temporarily. I’ll see to adding a dogmatic and liturgical element to my philosophy. Humanitism will be a religion itself, the religion of the future, the only true one. Christianity is only good for women and beggars, and the other religions are no better: they all tend toward the same vulgarity or weakness. The Christian paradise is a worthy emulator of its Muslim counterpart; and as for Buddha’s Nirvana, it’s no more than a notion hatched by paralytics. You shall see what humanistic religion is. The final absorption, the contractive phase, is the reconstitution of substance, not its annihilation, et cetera. Go wherever you are called; but never forget that you are my caliph.”",20,RO005TR06

Moreover, phenomena of the conscience are not easily analyzed; if I were to speak of one, I would have to speak of all those that hang on it, and in the end I would write an entire chapter on psychology. I will simply declare that it was the most brilliant phase of my life. The tableaux were mournful; they had the monotony of misfortune, which is just as tedious as that of pleasure, and perhaps worse. But the joy that one gives to the souls of the ill and the poor is a reward of some value; and let no one say that it is negative, for only the beneficiaries receive it.

I never saw her again; I heard no more about her life, whether her mother had died, or what misfortune had brought her to such misery. I do know that she remained lame and sad.

He returned four months later and came by my house one morning nearly in the state in which I had seen him in the Passeio Público. Now his gaze was transformed. He was demented.

When they were later published in book form, I made a number of changes, and, having now read the text of this third edition, I have made a few more amendments and deletions.

3266,6,"When reviewing the book, Capistrano de Abreu asked, “Is Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas a novel?” In a letter to me at the time, Macedo Soares was kind enough to speak of it in the same breath as Almeida Garrett’s Travels in My Homeland. To that first question, the late Brás Cubas responded (as the reader will have seen or will see in the preface that follows) with a Yes and a No, saying that while some considered it a novel, others did not. The deceased’s response to the second remark was this: “True, it is a somewhat rambling book, and although I, Brás Cubas, may well have adopted the free form of a Sterne or a Xavier de Maistre, I have added a little petulant pessimism of my own.” All those writers traveled: Xavier de Maistre traveled around his room, Garrett around his own homeland, Sterne around other people’s homelands. Of Brás Cubas one could perhaps say that he traveled around life.",21,RO005TR07

3270,10,"Stendhal’s confession that he wrote one of his books for a mere hundred readers is a cause of astonishment and consternation. It would, however, cause neither astonishment nor, indeed, consternation if this book failed to find even Stendhal’s readership of one hundred, or indeed fifty, or twenty, or, at most, ten. Ten? Perhaps five. True, it is a somewhat rambling book, and although I, Brás Cubas, may well have adopted the free form of a Sterne or a Xavier de Maistre,* I have added a little petulant pessimism of my own. Why not? This is, after all, the work of a dead man. I wrote it with the pen of mirthful mockery and the ink of melancholy, and it is not hard to foresee what would result from such a marriage. Serious people will doubtless feel that the book bears all the hallmarks of a run-of-the-mill novel, while frivolous people will fail to find any of the qualities they have come to expect in a novel; it will thus win neither the respect of the serious nor the love of the frivolous, the two main pillars of popular opinion.",21,RO005TR07
3271,11,"I hope, nonetheless, to win the sympathy of said popular opinion, and the best way to do so would be to avoid writing a long, over-explicit prologue. The best prologue is the one that contains the fewest ideas, or sets them out in obscure, truncated form. I will, therefore, say nothing of the extraordinary method I employed when composing these Memoirs, written here in the next world. That would be intriguing, but would take far too long, and, besides, would add nothing to the reader’s understanding of the book. The book is sufficient unto itself: if you like it, dear reader, that is reward enough; if you do not, I reward you with a dismissive snap of my fingers, and bid you good riddance.",21,RO005TR07

3274,14,Death of the author,21,RO005TR07
3275,15,"FOR SOME TIME, I could not decide whether to begin these memoirs at the beginning or at the end, that is, whether I should start with my birth or my death. Since the usual approach is to begin with one’s birth, two considerations led me to adopt a different method: firstly, I am not so much a writer who has died, as a dead man who has decided to write, and for whom the grave proved to be another cradle; the second is that this approach will make what I write seem more elegant and more modern. Moses, who also described his own death, did so not at the outset, but at the end—a radical difference between this book and the Pentateuch.",21,RO005TR07
3276,16,"That said, I passed away at two o’clock in the afternoon on a Friday in August in 1869, in my beautiful mansion in the Catumbi district of the city. I was in my sixty-fourth year, still robust and prosperous, a bachelor possessed of some three hundred contos, and accompanied to the cemetery by just eleven friends. Eleven friends! True, no invitations had been sent out, no obituaries published. I should also add that it was raining—drizzling—a fine, sad, constant rain, so sad and so constant that it led one of those faithful few to weave this ingenious idea into the address he gave at the graveside:",21,RO005TR07
3277,17,"“You, sirs, who knew him, can say with me that nature itself seems to be mourning the irreparable loss of one of the finest men ever to grace humanity with his presence. This somber air, these drops from heaven, these dark clouds covering the blue with a funereal veil, all this is evidence of the terrible, raw grief gnawing at the very bowels of nature; all this speaks in sublime praise of our illustrious and dear departed friend.”",21,RO005TR07
3278,18,"Ah, good and faithful friend! No, I certainly don’t regret the twenty government bonds I left to him. And thus it was that I reached the close of my days; thus it was that I set off for Hamlet’s “undiscovered country,” with none of the young prince’s yearnings and doubts, but as slowly and unsteadily as someone returning home late from the theater. Late and feeling somewhat grumpy. Around nine or ten people came to see me off, among them three ladies: my sister Sabina, married to Cotrim, and their daughter—a real lily of the valley—and . . . but patience! I will tell you shortly who the third lady was.",21,RO005TR07
3279,19,"Suffice it to say that, although unrelated to me, this nameless person suffered more than any of my actual relatives. It’s true, she really did. I’m not saying she tore her hair out, I’m not saying she writhed about on the ground. Besides, I did not exactly die a dramatic death . . . A bachelor who breathes his last at the age of sixty-four is hardly the stuff of tragedy, and so it wouldn’t really have been right for that anonymous lady to behave as if it were. Standing at the head of my bed, her eyes wide, her lips parted, the sad lady could barely comprehend that I was gone.",21,RO005TR07
3280,20,“Dead! Dead!” she was saying to herself.,21,RO005TR07
3281,21,"And like the storks seen by an illustrious traveler as they took flight from the Ilissos River for the shores of Africa, indifferent both to the ruins below and to time—her imagination likewise took flight over those present-day ruins for the shores of the Africa of her youth . . . But let her go; we will follow later, when I return to my younger self.",21,RO005TR07
3282,22,"Now, I wish to die peacefully, methodically, listening to the ladies sobbing, the men quietly talking, the rain drumming on the caladium leaves in the garden, and the grating noise made by a grinder sharpening a knife outside a chain-maker’s forge. I can assure you that this orchestra of death was not as sad as it might seem. At a certain point later on, it became almost delicious. Life was struggling for survival in my breast, like a series of breaking waves; my consciousness was fading, I was slipping into physical and moral stasis, and my body was turning me into plant, stone, mud, nothing.",21,RO005TR07
3283,23,"I died of pneumonia, but if I tell you, the reader, that the cause of my death wasn’t so much pneumonia as a grandiose and futile idea, you might not believe me, and yet it’s true. I will briefly set out the facts. Judge for yourself.",21,RO005TR07

3285,25,The poultice,21,RO005TR07
3286,26,"SO, ONE MORNING, while I was strolling in the garden, an idea appeared on the trapeze I have inside my head. Once there, it began to fling its arms and legs about, performing the most daring acrobatics imaginable. I simply watched, transfixed. Suddenly it made a huge leap, stretching out arms and legs to make an X: Either decipher me or I will eat you up.",21,RO005TR07
3287,27,"That idea was neither more nor less than the invention of a truly sublime remedy, an anti-melancholia poultice, intended as a salve for our melancholy humanity. In my application to patent this invention, I drew the government’s attention to this truly Christian solution. I did not, on the other hand, deny to my friends the pecuniary advantages that could accrue from the distribution of a product with such profound effects.",21,RO005TR07
3288,28,"However, now that I am here on the other side of life, I can confess everything: what really attracted me was the pleasure it would give me to see in newspapers, on shop counters, in pamphlets and on street corners and, of course, on the actual boxes containing the remedy, these four words: “The Brás Cubas Poultice.” Why deny it?",21,RO005TR07
3289,29,"I was obsessed with public acclaim, posters, and pyrotechnics. More modest people might condemn this as a fault; I trust, though, that the more astute will acknowledge it as a gift. My idea, then, had two sides to it, like a medal, one turned to the public, the other to me. On the one side, philanthropy and profit, on the other, a thirst for fame. Or shall we call it a love of glory?",21,RO005TR07
3290,30,"An uncle of mine, a canon, used to say that love of temporal glory was the perdition of the soul, which should yearn only for eternal glory. To which another uncle, an officer in one of our oldest infantry regiments, would retort that the love of glory was man’s most truly human quality and, therefore, his most genuine feature.",21,RO005TR07
3291,31,"I leave it to the reader to decide who was right, the soldier or the canon; I, meanwhile, return to my poultice.",21,RO005TR07

3293,33,Genealogy,21,RO005TR07
3294,34,"BUT NOW THAT I’VE MENTIONED my two uncles, allow me to draw you a brief genealogical sketch.",21,RO005TR07
3295,35,"The founder of my family was a certain Damião Cubas, who flourished in the first half of the eighteenth century. He was—both by name and by trade—a maker of barrels, or cubas. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he would have died in poverty and obscurity had he restricted his activities to barrel-making. But no, he became a farmer, planting and harvesting and exchanging his produce for good, honest cash, until he died, leaving his considerable fortune to a highly educated son, Luís Cubas.",21,RO005TR07
3296,36,"It is with this young man that my ancestral line really begins—the ancestors, that is, to which my family would happily admit—because Damião Cubas was, after all, a mere barrel-maker, possibly not even a very good one, whereas Luís Cubas had studied at Coimbra University, risen to a prominent position in government, and become a close personal friend of the viceroy, the Conde da Cunha.",21,RO005TR07
3297,37,"Since the surname Cubas had rather too much of a whiff of barrel-making about it, my father—great-grandson of Damião—claimed that the name Cubas had been bestowed on a nobleman, a hero of Portugal’s exploits in Africa, as a reward for capturing three hundred cubas—or kubba, sanctuaries—from the Moors. My father was an imaginative fellow and escaped from the barrel-maker’s shop on the wings of a pun. He was a decent man, my father, and more dignified and loyal than most. True, he was not without a touch of vanity, but then who in this world is not?",21,RO005TR07
3298,38,"I should point out that he only resorted to invention having first tried fabrication; for he had initially attached himself to the family of my famous namesake, Brás Cubas—the founder and governor of São Vicente, the town where he died in 1592—and who was, moreover, the reason my father christened me Brás. The governor’s family, however, roundly denied any such connection, and it was then that my father came up with those three hundred imaginary Moorish cubas.",21,RO005TR07
3299,39,"Some members of my family are still alive: my niece, Venância, for example, that pure lily of the valley, the very flower of all the women of her day; her father is still alive too, a man who . . . but let us not anticipate events; let us have done, once and for all, with our poultice.",21,RO005TR07
3300,40,CHAPTER IV,21,RO005TR07
3301,41,The idée fixe,21,RO005TR07
3302,42,"AFTER PERFORMING all those somersaults, my idea had become an idée fixe. May God defend you, dear reader, from an idée fixe, better a mote in your eye, better a beam. Think only of Cavour. His idée fixe of a united Italy eventually killed him. Bismarck’s idée fixe did not kill him, of course, but then nature is such a capricious creature and history has ever been a strumpet. Suetonius, for example, gave us a Claudius, who was a simpleton—or, as Seneca called him, a “pumpkin”– and a Titus, who was the delight and darling of Rome.",21,RO005TR07
3303,43,"A professor recently found a way of demonstrating that, of the two Caesars, the true delight and darling was actually Seneca’s “pumpkin.” And you, Madame Lucrezia, the flower of the Borgia family, whom one poet described as a Catholic Messalina, you were saved by a skeptical German historian, Ferdinand Gregorovius, who did much to mitigate that view, and while you may not have emerged as a pure white lily, neither were you a bog. I sit midway between the poet and the historian.",21,RO005TR07
3304,44,"Long live history, then, the fickle history that can be put to any use; but to return to the idée fixe, I would say that out of such ideas come strong men and maniacs, while out of vague, shifting, mutable ideas come Claudiuses à la Suetonius.",21,RO005TR07
3305,45,"My idée fixe was very fixed indeed, as fixed as . . . well, I can’t think of anything in the world that is quite as fixed: perhaps the Moon, perhaps the pyramids of Egypt, perhaps Germany’s dear departed Confederate Diet. Let the reader choose the comparison that suits him best, and don’t get all sniffy with me just because we haven’t yet reached the narrative part of these memoirs. We will. Like most other readers—your confrères—I think I, too, prefer anecdote to reflection, and believe I’m right to do so.",21,RO005TR07
3306,46,"We will get there. I should, though, warn you that this book is written in a leisurely fashion, as befits a man no longer troubled by the swift passage of time; it is an extremely philosophical work, although its philosophy is somewhat uneven, one moment austere, the next playful, a work that neither builds nor destroys, neither inflames nor chills, and which is more pastime than doctrine.",21,RO005TR07
3307,47,"So let us begin; stop your sniffing and let us get back to that poultice, and forget all about history, which can be as capricious as any elegant society lady. None of us fought in the Battle of Salamis, none of us wrote the Augsburg Confession;§ and for my part, if my thoughts ever do turn to Cromwell, it’s only because I enjoy imagining that the same royal hand that dissolved Parliament could well have imposed the Brás Cubas Poultice on the entire English population. And don’t laugh at this twin triumph of pharmacy and puritanism.",21,RO005TR07
3308,48,"As we all know, beside every large, flamboyant, public flag there are often various other, modestly private flags, which are hoisted up to flutter in that other flag’s shadow, and which quite often outlive it. To offer a rather poor analogy, it is like the rabble who once sought shelter within the walls of the feudal castle: the castle fell and the rabble remained. Admittedly, the rabble then grew in power and themselves became the kings of the castle . . . No, it’s not a good analogy at all.",21,RO005TR07
3309,49,CHAPTER V,21,RO005TR07
3310,50,In which a lady’s ear appears,21,RO005TR07
3311,51,"ALAS, when I was busy preparing and perfecting my invention, I happened to sit in a cold draft and immediately fell ill, but failed to take proper care of myself. I had that poultice stuck in my head; I was carrying around that idée fixe about the mad and the strong. I could see myself as if from afar, rising up above the hordes and into the sky like an immortal eagle, and, in the face of such a lofty spectacle, a man cannot feel the pain afflicting him.",21,RO005TR07
3312,52,"The next day I was feeling even worse, and I did, finally, attend to myself, but halfheartedly, unmethodically, carelessly, and inconsistently; and that is the origin of the illness that brought me to eternity. As you already know, I died on a Friday, an unfortunate day on which to die, and, as I think I have established, it was my invention that killed me. Less lucid proofs than mine have met with triumphant cheers.",21,RO005TR07
3313,53,"However, it was still not impossible that I would climb to the very summit of the century and appear in the newspapers, among other Methuselahs. I was strong and healthy. Imagine if, instead of laying the foundations of a pharmaceutical invention, I had been trying to piece together the elements of a political institution or of a religious reform. Then along came that cold draft, which outdid in efficiency all our human plans, and that was that. Thus is the fate of all mankind.",21,RO005TR07
3314,54,"With that thought, I bade farewell to the woman who, while she was not, I would say, the most discreet, was certainly the most beautiful of all her contemporaries, the unnamed lady from the first chapter, the one whose imagination took flight like those storks by the Ilissos River . . . By then she was fifty-four years old, a ruin, but a very imposing one. Imagine, dear reader, that she and I had loved each other many years before and that, one day, as I lay on my sickbed, I saw her appear at my bedroom door . . .",21,RO005TR07
3315,55,CHAPTER VI,21,RO005TR07
3316,56,"Chimène, que l’eût dit? Rodrigue, qui l’eût cru?",21,RO005TR07
3317,57,"I SAW HER APPEAR at the bedroom door, pale, tearful, all in black, and watched her linger there for a whole minute, unable to summon up the courage to come in, or perhaps deterred by the presence of the other man who was in the room at the time. I observed her closely from the bed where I lay, and it did not even occur to me to speak or make some gesture. We had not seen each other for two years, and I was seeing her not as she was now, but as she had been, as we both had been, because some mysterious Hezekiah had made the sun turn back to the days of our youth.# The sun turned back, and all my woes fell away, and this handful of dust, which death was about to scatter into the eternal void, outdid time itself, death’s minister. Not even a drop of Juventas’s** rejuvenating water could match the sweet allure of the past.",21,RO005TR07
3318,58,"Believe me, remembering is the lesser evil, for no one can trust in present-day happiness, which always contains a little of Cain’s spittle. Once time has passed and the spasm is over, perhaps then you can truly enjoy it, because, if you have to choose between those two illusions, choose the one you can savor without pain.",21,RO005TR07
3319,59,"This evocation of lost joys proved short-lived, because reality soon prevailed, and the present drove out the past. Later, in some small corner of this book, I will perhaps regale the reader with my theory of human editions. All you need to know now, though, is that Virgília—for that was her name—entered the room with a firm step, with the gravity bestowed on her by her clothes and the years, and walked over to the bed. The stranger got up and left. He was someone who visited me every day to speak of the exchange rate, colonization, and the need to develop the railways; what could possibly be of more interest to a dying man?",21,RO005TR07
3320,60,"He left; Virgília remained standing; and, for some time, we gazed at each other without speaking. Who would have thought it? Twenty years on, all that was left of two great lovers, of two unbridled passions, were two withered hearts, ravaged by and satiated with life, whether in equal measure I cannot say, but definitely satiated. Virgília now possessed the beauty of old age, an austere, maternal look; she wasn’t as thin as when I saw her for the last time at a St. John’s Eve festival in Tijuca; and because she was the sort to fend off old age for as long as possible, only now were a few silver threads beginning to appear in her dark hair.",21,RO005TR07
3321,61,“Have you taken to visiting the dead?” I asked.,21,RO005TR07
3322,62,"“What do you mean, ‘the dead’?” answered Virgília, tuttutting. Then she squeezed my hands. “I’ve simply come to see if I can make this lazybones get up out of bed and into the street again.”",21,RO005TR07
3323,63,"Her voice no longer had the same caressing, lachrymose tone of yesteryear, but it was nonetheless tender and sweet. She sat down. Since I was alone in the house, apart from a male nurse, we could speak freely. Virgília gave me a long account of life outside, and she did so in a witty, slightly waspish manner that lent a certain piquancy to her words. Ready as I was to depart this world, I took a satanic pleasure in mocking it, in persuading myself that what I was leaving behind really wasn’t anything worth having.",21,RO005TR07
3324,64,"“Oh, come, now!” Virgília interrupted me somewhat angrily. “If you’re not careful, I won’t come and see you again. What do you mean, ‘die’? We all have to die, being alive is a guarantee of that.”",21,RO005TR07
3325,65,"And then looking at the clock, she said:",21,RO005TR07
3326,66,"“Goodness, it’s three o’clock. I must be going.”",21,RO005TR07
3327,67,“Already?”,21,RO005TR07
3328,68,"“Yes, already, but I’ll come back tomorrow or the day after.”",21,RO005TR07
3329,69,"“I’m not sure that would be proper,” I retorted. “The patient is a bachelor, and there are no ladies in the house.”",21,RO005TR07
3330,70,“What about your sister?”,21,RO005TR07
3331,71,"“She’s coming to spend a few days here, but won’t arrive until Saturday.”",21,RO005TR07
3332,72,"Virgília thought for a moment, then shrugged and said gravely:",21,RO005TR07
3333,73,"“Oh, I’m an old woman now! No one takes any notice of me anymore. But just in case, I’ll bring Nhonhô.”",21,RO005TR07
3334,74,"Nhonhô was a law graduate, her only son, who, at the age of five, had been the unwitting accomplice to our love. They both came to see me two days later, and I confess that, when I saw them there, in my bedroom, I felt so overcome by shyness that, at first, I felt unable to respond to the young man’s kind words of greeting. Virgília noticed this and said to her son:",21,RO005TR07
3335,75,"‘Nhonhô, take no notice of this old fraud. He won’t say anything because he wants you to believe he’s at death’s door.”",21,RO005TR07
3336,76,"Nhonhô smiled, and I think I smiled too, and we all laughed. Virgília was bright and serene, like one who has led a spotless life. No suspect looks, no telltale gestures, instead a perfect equilibrium between word and mind, a degree of self-control that seemed, and perhaps was, remarkable. When we happened to touch on some illicit love affair which was half secret and half public knowledge, I watched her speak with scorn and even indignation about the woman involved, who was, besides, a friend of hers. Her son was pleased to hear her hold forth with such force and dignity, and I wondered to myself what the sparrow hawks would have to say about us, had Buffon†† been born a sparrow hawk . . .",21,RO005TR07

3339,79,The delirium,21,RO005TR07
3340,80,"AS FAR AS I KNOW, no one has as yet described his own delirium; I will do so here, and science will thank me for it. If you, the reader, are not much given to contemplating such mental phenomena, feel free to skip this chapter and jump straight to the plot. However lacking in curiosity you may be, though, I would just say that what went on in my head for some twenty or thirty minutes was actually very interesting.",21,RO005TR07
3341,81,"First, I took on the character of a deft, potbellied Chinese barber engaged in shaving a Mandarin, who repaid me for my hard work with a combination of pinches and confectionery: well, that’s Chinese Mandarins for you.",21,RO005TR07
3342,82,"Then suddenly I was transformed into Saint Thomas Aquinas’s Summa Theologica, a one-volume edition bound in Morocco leather, complete with engravings and silver clasps; this rendered my body completely immobile; and I can still remember that, since my hands were the clasps, I folded them on my chest, and someone (doubtless Virgília) gently unfolded them, because she felt such a pose too closely resembled that of a corpse.",21,RO005TR07
3343,83,"Once I was again restored to human form, who should arrive but a hippopotamus, who picked me up and carried me off. And I allowed myself to be borne along and said not a word, whether out of fear or because I had complete confidence in the beast I really don’t know, but soon it was galloping along at such a speed that I ventured to speak, saying, rather artfully, that we appeared to be going nowhere.",21,RO005TR07
3344,84,"“That’s where you’re wrong,” said the hippopotamus, “we’re going back to the origin of the centuries.”",21,RO005TR07
3345,85,"I suggested that this must be a very long way indeed, but the hippopotamus either didn’t understand or didn’t hear, or else pretended to neither hear nor understand; and when, on learning that he had the power of speech, I asked if he was descended from Achilles’s horse or from Balaam’s ass, he responded with a gesture peculiar to both those quadrupeds: he waggled his ears. For my part, I closed my eyes and abandoned myself to happenstance.",21,RO005TR07
3346,86,"I don’t mind admitting now that I felt a few stirrings of curiosity to know where the origin of centuries was to be found, whether it was as mysterious as the origin of the Nile, and, more importantly, whether it was of more or less importance than the end of those same centuries—clearly the thoughts of an ailing brain. Traveling along as I was with my eyes closed, I could not see what route we took; all I can remember is that it grew colder as the journey continued, and at one point it seemed to me that we had entered the region of eternal ice.",21,RO005TR07
3347,87,"And when I opened my eyes, I saw that my steed was galloping over a plain, white with snow, with the occasional snow mountain, the odd piece of snow vegetation, and several large snow animals. Everything was snow, even the sun, which was chilling us to the bone. I tried to speak, but could only stammer out this one anxious question:",21,RO005TR07
3348,88,“Where are we?”,21,RO005TR07
3349,89,“We’ve just passed Eden.”,21,RO005TR07
3350,90,"“Good, let’s call in at Abraham’s tent.”",21,RO005TR07
3351,91,“How can I when we’re traveling backwards!” replied my mount in a mocking voice.,21,RO005TR07
3352,92,"I felt both vexed and confused. I was beginning to find the journey tedious and absurd, the cold intolerable, the speed of travel violent, and the end result elusive to say the least. And then—again, these are the musings of a sick man—even if we did reach our intended destination, it was not impossible that the centuries, annoyed at having their origin revealed, would crush me between their fingernails, which must be as ancient as they are.",21,RO005TR07
3353,93,"All the while I was thinking this, we were eating up the miles and the plain was flying past beneath our feet, until the beast suddenly stopped, and I had the chance to look around me calmly. Only look, mind, for I saw nothing, apart from the vast whiteness of the snow, which had now invaded even the hitherto blue sky. Here and there I may have glimpsed the occasional enormous, grotesque plant, its broad leaves swaying in the wind. The silence there was like the silence of the grave: it was as if all inanimate life had been struck dumb in the presence of a man.",21,RO005TR07
3354,94,"Did it fall from the sky? Did it spring from the earth? I don’t know, I only know that a huge shape, a female figure, appeared before me then, fixing me with eyes as dazzling as the sun. Everything about that figure was vast in the way that wild things are, in a way that defies human comprehension, for it appeared to have no boundaries and what at first sight seemed solid often proved to be entirely diaphanous. I was too stunned to utter a sound, even a scream, but after a brief moment I asked—the curiosity of the delirious—who she was and her name.",21,RO005TR07
3355,95,“Call me Nature or Pandora. I am your mother and your enemy.”,21,RO005TR07
3356,96,"When I heard that last word, I drew back a little in alarm. The figure let out a loud guffaw, which had the effect of a typhoon, for, all around us, the trees and plants were hurled about, and a long moan broke the silence of those external things.",21,RO005TR07
3357,97,"“Don’t be afraid,” she said, “my enmity does not kill; indeed, it finds its affirmation in life. The very fact that you are alive means that I need inflict no further punishment on you.”",21,RO005TR07
3358,98,"“Alive?” I asked, digging my nails into my hands as if seeking proof of my continued existence.",21,RO005TR07
3359,99,"“Yes, worm, you are alive. But don’t worry about losing that tattered rag of a body of which you are so proud; you will taste the bread of sorrow and the wine of misery for a few more hours yet. You are alive, yes, now that you have lost your mind, you are alive, and were your consciousness momentarily to regain its sanity, you would declare that you want to continue to live.”",21,RO005TR07
3360,100,"With these words, the vision reached out one arm, grabbed me by the hair, and lifted me into the air as if I were a feather. Only then did I see her face from close to, and it was huge. Utterly calm, entirely unruffled by any violent emotion, by hatred or aggression, its sole, all-consuming expression was one of egotistical impassivity, of eternal indifference, of immovable will. Any anger—assuming she could feel anger—was locked away in her heart. And yet that glacial face had a youthful air about it, a mixture of energy and vigor before which I felt myself to be the feeblest and most decrepit of creatures.",21,RO005TR07
3361,101,"“Do you understand?” she said, after a period of mutual contemplation.",21,RO005TR07
3362,102,"“No,” I said, “and I don’t want to, either; you’re absurd, you’re a myth. I am obviously dreaming, or, if I really have gone mad, then you are the figment of a madman’s mind, which is to say, a vain thing that my absent reason can neither control nor touch. You say you are Nature? The Nature I know is always a mother and never an enemy; she doesn’t make life a punishment, nor, like you, does she have the blank face of a tombstone. And why do you call yourself Pandora?”",21,RO005TR07

3365,105,"“I’m sure you do. For I am not only life, I am death too, and you are about to return to me what I once lent you. O great libertine, what awaits you is the voluptuousness of the void.”",21,RO005TR07
3366,106,"When, like a rumble of thunder, that word echoed throughout the immense valley below, I imagined it would be the very last sound I heard; I seemed to feel my entire self suddenly decompose. Then I looked at her with pleading eyes and begged her for a few more years.",21,RO005TR07
3367,107,"“What? You want another wretched minute?” she cried. “Whatever do you want with a few more moments of life? Just so that you can devour and be devoured afterwards? Have you not had enough of the spectacle and the struggle? Surely you have had your fill of the less difficult and less painful things I’ve shown you: the brightness of dawn, the melancholy of evening, the stillness of night, the Earth’s many different aspects, and even of sleep, my greatest gift to humankind. What more do you want, you sublime idiot?”",21,RO005TR07
3368,108,"“I just want to live; I ask nothing more. Who put that love of life in my heart if not you? And if I love life, why do harm to yourself by killing me?”",21,RO005TR07
3369,109,"“Because I no longer need you. Time doesn’t care about the passing minute, only about the minute to come. The minute to come seems so strong and jocund, and although it appears to carry eternity within it, instead it brings death, and perishes like all the other minutes before; only time persists. Egotism, you say. Yes, egotism, I know no other law. Egotism, self-preservation. The jaguar kills the calf, reasoning that jaguars have to live, and if the calf is tender, so much the better: that is the law of the universe. Come with me and see for yourself.”",21,RO005TR07
3370,110,"And with that, she carried me off to the top of a mountain, and from there I peered long and hard into the distance and the mist, and was witness to a truly remarkable sight. Imagine, dear reader, a distillation, a procession of all the centuries, all the races, all the passions, the tumult of empires, the war of appetites and of hatreds, the reciprocal destruction of beings and things. That was the spectacle I saw, a strangely painful spectacle.",21,RO005TR07
3371,111,"The history of mankind and of the Earth thus took on an intensity that neither knowledge nor the imagination could provide, because knowledge is slower and the imagination vaguer, whereas what I saw was the living summation of all the ages. To describe it would be like trying to pin down a lightning bolt. The centuries whirled past, and yet, because the eyes of the delirious see differently, I saw everything that passed before me—punishments and pleasures—from that thing we call glory to that other thing we call misery, and I saw love multiplying misery, and I saw misery aggravating weakness.",21,RO005TR07
3372,112,"There was devouring greed, incendiary rage, drooling envy, the hoe and the pen—both damp with sweat—as well as ambition, hunger, vanity, melancholy, wealth, and love, all furiously rattling mankind as if we were a tinkling cowbell, until we were worn to a frazzle. They were the various forms of evil, which one moment ate away at the viscera, the next at the mind, and which, dressed in a harlequin outfit, strolled casually around among us humans. Occasionally the pain eased, but only to give way to indifference, which was a dreamless sleep, or to pleasure, which was a kind of bastard pain.",21,RO005TR07
3373,113,"Then man, punished and rebellious, would flee from all that doom and gloom and go chasing after a nebulous, elusive figure made of shreds and patches, a scrap of the impalpable, another of the improbable, yet another of the invisible, all precariously stitched together with the needle of the imagination; and that figure—which was neither more nor less than the chimera of happiness—either perpetually eluded him or allowed itself to be grabbed by the shirttail; man would then clutch the chimera to his bosom, only for it to give a mocking guffaw and vanish like the illusion it was.",21,RO005TR07
3374,114,"In the face of such calamity, I could not suppress an anxious yelp, which Nature or Pandora heard without a hint of protest or amusement; instead, as if obeying some unknown law of insanity, I was the one who started laughing, wildly, idiotically.",21,RO005TR07
3375,115,"“You’re right,” I said, “it is funny and definitely worth seeing, a touch monotonous perhaps, but still definitely worth seeing. When Job cursed the day he was conceived, that was because he had never viewed the spectacle from up here. Come on, Pandora, open your womb and devour me; it’s fun to watch, but devour me anyway.”",21,RO005TR07
3376,116,"Her response was to force me to look down again and see the centuries, which continued to pass swiftly and turbulently, the generations succeeding each other, some sad, like the Hebrews when they were in captivity, others joyful, like the degenerates of Commodus’s reign,‡‡ and all of them punctually keeping their rendezvous with the grave. I wanted to run away, but a mysterious force kept me standing there; then I said to myself: “The centuries continue to pass, soon my century will arrive and that will pass too, until the final one turns up to explain eternity to me.”",21,RO005TR07
3377,117,"And I kept my eyes fixed on the procession, watching the passing ages as they came and went, and I felt calm and resolute, possibly even happy. Yes, maybe even happy. Each century brought with it its share of light and shade, apathy and resistance, truth and error, its cortège of systems, new ideas, new illusions; in each of them the green leaves of spring burst forth, grew shriveled and yellow, then green again.",21,RO005TR07
3378,118,"As life maintained the regularity of a calendar, history and civilization were evolving, and man, naked and unarmed, armed and clothed himself, built hovels and palaces, rustic villages and hundred-gated Thebes, created the science that scrutinizes, the art that enraptures, became orator, mechanic, philosopher, traveled the whole face of the globe, descended into the bowels of the Earth, rose up to the sphere of the clouds, thus collaborating in the whole mysterious process, which he used to while away the necessity of living and the melancholy of powerlessness.",21,RO005TR07
3379,119,"Finally, my bored, distracted gaze saw the present century arrive, and behind it the centuries to come. The former arrived, and however nimble, deft, vibrant, confident, however garrulous, bold, and knowing, it proved ultimately to be as wretched as the previous centuries, and so it passed and so the others passed too, just as rapidly and monotonously. Then I redoubled my attention, for I was about to see the last century—the last one! By then, though, they were passing so quickly that they defied comprehension; in comparison, a flash of lightning would have felt like a century. .",21,RO005TR07
3380,120,"Perhaps that’s why the objects kept changing: some grew, some shrank, others vanished into thin air or were engulfed in a mist—all except the hippopotamus that had brought me there, and which began to shrink and shrink and shrink, until it was the size of a cat. In fact, it was a cat. I took a closer look; it was my cat Sultão, who was playing with a ball of paper at my bedroom door . .",21,RO005TR07

3385,125,"Folly, however, has long been in the habit of taking a fancy to other people’s houses, and once she’s taken up residence, she’s almost impossible to shift. It’s a deep-seated habit of hers, and she’s become immune to any sense of shame. Now, if we consider the vast number of houses that she occupies, some permanently, others only in the summer months, we would conclude that this amiable pilgrim is the bane of all homeowners. In this particular case, there was a bit of a scuffle outside the door to my brain, because the incomer didn’t want to give up the house, and the owner stubbornly insisted on taking back what was hers. Folly finally agreed to make do with a small corner in the attic.",21,RO005TR07
3386,126,"“Certainly not, madam,” retorted Reason, “I’m fed up with giving you corners in attics, because I know from long, painful experience that what you want is to sneak down from the attic to the dining room, and from there to the parlor, until you’ve taken over the whole house.”",21,RO005TR07

3395,135,"NOW OBSERVE HOW SKILLFULLY, how artfully, I make this important transition in the book. Observe: my delirium began in Virgília’s presence; Virgília was the one major transgression of my youth; there is no youth without childhood; and since childhood implies birth, that brings us effortlessly to October 20, 1805, the day I was born. Did you see what I did? Utterly seamless, nothing that might disrupt the reader’s rapt attention, not a thing.",21,RO005TR07
3396,136,"This book thus enjoys all the advantages of method, with none of the rigidity that method can bring with it. And to be honest, it was time for a little method. Although while method is, of course, indispensable, it’s always best to adopt one that has discarded its tie and its suspenders, one that is rather lightly, casually dressed, like someone who cares not one iota about what the neighbor opposite or the local police officer might think. In that respect, it’s like eloquence, which exists in two forms, one that is genuine and vibrant and naturally captivating, and another that is stiff and starchy and insipid. Let us go now to October 20.",21,RO005TR07

3398,138,On that day,21,RO005TR07
3399,139,"ON THAT DAY, the tree of the Cubas family brought forth a beautiful flower. I was born; I was received into the arms of Pascoela, an illustrious midwife from Minho, who boasted of having opened the door of the world to an entire generation of noblemen. It’s not impossible that my father heard her make such a claim; I think, though, that it was paternal feeling that prompted him to reward her with two half doubloons. Duly washed and diapered, I immediately became the hero of our household. Each family member predicted for me the future career most to his taste. My Uncle João, the former infantry officer, thought I had a look of Bonaparte about me, a prediction my father could not hear without feeling physically sick; my Uncle Ildefonso, a mere priest at the time, sensed I would become a canon.",21,RO005TR07
3400,140,"“Mark my words, he’ll be a canon one day, and I say no more lest I should be accused of the sin of pride, but I wouldn’t be in the least surprised if God intended him for a bishopric, yes, a bishopric. It’s not impossible. What do you say, brother?”",21,RO005TR07
3401,141,"My father’s reply was always the same: that I would be whatever God wanted me to be; and then he would lift me up, as if to show me off to the city and to the world; and he would ask everyone if I didn’t look remarkably like him, if I wasn’t just as intelligent, just as handsome . . .",21,RO005TR07
3402,142,"I give only a brief sketch of these things, as they were told to me years later, for I know almost none of the major details of that remarkable day. I do know that the neighbors came to pay their respects to the newborn, and that, during the first few weeks, we had many visitors. No sedan chair was left unemployed; many tailcoats and breeches were given an airing. The only reason I do not list all the presents, kisses, compliments, and blessings I received is that, if I did, I would never finish this chapter, and I do need to finish it.",21,RO005TR07
3403,143,"Item: I have nothing to say about my baptism, because no one ever told me about it, except to say that it was one of the most elegant parties held the following year, 1806; I was baptized in the Church of São Domingos one Tuesday in March, a clear, bright, luminous day, with, as my godparents, Colonel Rodrigues de Matos and his lady wife. They were both descended from old families in the north and were truly an honor to the blood that ran in their veins, and which had once been spilled in the war against Holland. I believe their names were among the first words I learned; and I must have spoken them with great aplomb or revealed some precocious talent for doing so, because I was obliged to repeat them to any stranger we happened to meet.",21,RO005TR07

3412,152,The child is father of the man,21,RO005TR07
3413,153,"I GREW, and in this my family played no part at all; I grew quite naturally, just as magnolia trees and cats do. Although cats might be less cunning, and magnolia trees are certainly less restive than I was as a child. A poet once said that the child is father of the man. If this is true, then let us take a look at some of this particular child’s distinguishing characteristics.",21,RO005TR07
3414,154,"From the age of five, I fully deserved the nickname “Little Devil,” because that is precisely what I was; I was one of the most devilish boys of my day, sly, sneaky, wicked, and willful. For example, I once cracked open the head of a slave-woman simply because she refused to give me a spoonful of the coconut dessert she was making, and, not content with that foul deed, I then added a handful of ashes to the pot, and, not satisfied with that evil trick, I went and told my mother that the slave had spoiled the dessert “out of spite”—and at the time I was only six years old.",21,RO005TR07
3415,155,"Prudêncio, one of the slave-boys, was my regular mount: he would get down on all fours, and I would place a rope between his teeth as a bridle, climb onto his back, and then, with a stick in my hand, I would whip him and make him carry me hither and thither, this way and that, and he would obey, apart from the occasional groan or, at most, a cry of, “Oh, please, Massa!” to which I would retort: “Shut your mouth, you beast!”",21,RO005TR07
3416,156,"Hiding visitors’ hats, pinning paper tails on earnest adults, tugging at girls’ braids, pinching the arms of matronly ladies, and other such misdemeanors, were clear evidence of a wayward nature, but since my father held me in high esteem, I must also believe that they were merely the expressions of a forceful personality; and while he did sometimes tell me off in public, he was only doing so for form’s sake; in private, he showered me with kisses.",21,RO005TR07
3417,157,"Don’t go thinking I spent the rest of my life cracking open people’s heads or hiding their hats, though I was indeed opinionated, egotistical, and rather contemptuous of others; and while I may not have continued to hide their hats, I did occasionally tug their pigtails.",21,RO005TR07
3418,158,"I also took pleasure in observing examples of human injustice, tending to mitigate, explain, categorize, and understand them not according to any rigid pattern, but depending on context and circumstance. My mother indoctrinated me in her own way, making me learn by heart certain precepts and prayers; but I felt I was governed not by prayers but by nerves and blood, and, for me, good principles lacked any of the spirituality that gives them their potency and became mere empty formulas. In the morning, before my porridge, and at night, before bed, I would pray to God to forgive me my trespasses as I forgave those who trespassed against me, but between morning and night I was sure to commit some grave misdeed, and my father, once the fuss had died down, would pat my cheek and say, laughing: “You little rascal, you!”",21,RO005TR07
3419,159,"Yes, my father adored me. My mother was a weak woman of little brain and much heart, very gullible and genuinely pious—homely for all her prettiness, and modest for all her wealth; and she lived in fear of her husband’s temper tantrums. Her husband was her god on Earth. Out of the collaboration between those two creatures sprang my education, which, although it had its good points, was, generally speaking, imperfect, incomplete, and, in parts, negative. My uncle the canon did sometimes tell his brother off, saying that he gave me more freedom than schooling, and more affection than discipline; my father would respond by declaring that he was applying to my education a system entirely superior to the usual one; he thus succeeded in deluding himself, but not his brother.",21,RO005TR07
3420,160,,21,RO005TR07
3421,161,"Along with these transmitted ideas and this so-called system of education there was yet another strange example: our domestic milieu. We have seen my parents, let us now take a look at my uncles. One of them, João, was a man who talked a great deal, lived a licentious life, and had a very picaresque turn of phrase. When I was only eleven years old, he was already regaling me with anecdotes, both true and false, but all tainted with obscenity or filth. He had no regard for my youth, just as he had no respect for his brother’s cassock, with the difference that while his brother immediately fled as soon as Uncle João turned the conversation to some scabrous matter, I did not. I stayed, not understanding a word at first, but eventually understanding everything and finding him most amusing. After a time, I would even seek him out, and he was very fond of me, and would give me sweets and take me for walks.",21,RO005TR07
3422,162,"At home, when he came to spend a few days with us, I would not infrequently find him at the bottom of the garden, chatting with the slave-women as they were doing the laundry; there it was one long stream of anecdotes, quips, questions, and explosions of laughter that no one else could hear, because the place where they did the laundry was a long way from the house. The women wore their dresses caught up around the waist, revealing quite a lot of leg, and while some stood in the washing tank and others outside it, bent over the clothes, beating and soaping and wringing them out, they would listen to and counter Uncle João’s jokes, and sometimes pass comment, saying:",21,RO005TR07
3423,163,"“Saints alive, but Sinhô João’s the very devil!”",21,RO005TR07
3424,164,"This was in stark contrast to my uncle the canon. He was all austerity and purity, but these qualities were not an adornment to a superior mind, they were merely compensation for a mediocre one. He did not see the real substance of the Church, he saw only the outer skin, the hierarchy, the grandeur, the surplices, the bowing. He was more interested in the sacristy than the altar. He got far more excited about some lacuna in the ritual than about any infraction of the commandments.",21,RO005TR07
3425,165,"When I think about him now, all these years later, I’m not sure he would have been capable of recalling a passage from Tertullian or, without hesitation, explaining the Symbolum Nicaenum, but at a sung mass, no one knew better than he the number and type of bows to be made to the officiant. Becoming a canon had been his sole ambition in life, and he would say with utter sincerity that it was the highest rank he could aspire to. Pious, strict in his habits, meticulous in his observance of the rules, weak, timid, and subaltern, he did have some virtues, in which he was exemplary, but he completely lacked the strength to instill them in others, let alone impose them.",21,RO005TR07
3426,166,"I say nothing of my maternal aunt, Dona Emerenciana, and yet she was the person who had the most authority over me, something that definitely marked her out from the others; but she lived with us only very briefly, for about two years. Other relatives and close family friends are not worth mentioning; we did not share a life in common, or only intermittently, with long periods spent apart. What matters is the general tone of my home life, and, as I have said, this consisted in a basic vulgarity of character, a love of glittering appearances, noise, and disorder, a general weakness of will, the triumph of the capricious, and so forth. It was from that soil and from that dung that this flower was born.",21,RO005TR07

3430,170,"When I was born, Napoleon was in the full pomp of his glory and power; as emperor, he was the object of universal wonderment. My father—who, in persuading others of our noble origins, had ended up persuading himself of them—harbored a purely mental loathing for him. This was the cause of hard-fought battles in our house, because my Uncle João, whether out of esprit de classe or esprit de corps, I’m not sure, forgave in the despot what he admired in the general, while my uncle, the priest, was unbendingly opposed to the Corsican, and my other relatives were divided on the subject: hence the many arguments and spats.",21,RO005TR07
3431,171,"Needless to say, the whole household was very shaken when news of Napoleon’s first great defeat reached Rio de Janeiro, but there were no mocking jibes or taunts. Seeing how the public rejoiced, the vanquished felt that silence would be the more decorous option; some went further and joined in the applause. The cheering, happy populace did not stint on its displays of affection for the royal family; there were illuminations, salvos, services of thanksgiving, processions, and ovations.",21,RO005TR07
3432,172,"At the time, I was proudly brandishing the toy sword my godfather had given me on St. Anthony’s Day and, frankly, I was far more interested in my toy sword than I was in the fall of Bonaparte. I’ve never forgotten that fact. And I’ve never stopped thinking to myself that one’s own little toy sword is always bigger than Napoleon’s real sword. And believe me, when I was alive, I listened to lots of speeches, read many bombastic pages full of grand ideas and even grander words, but, for some reason, behind the cheers they drew from my lips, this knowing thought would sometimes slither past:",21,RO005TR07

3434,174,"Not content with having only an anonymous share of the general rejoicing, my family thought it opportune and indeed essential to celebrate Bonaparte’s overthrow with a supper, and such a grand supper that the noise of the guests’ applause would reach the ears of His Highness or, at the very least, his ministers. No sooner said than done. Out came all the old silver inherited from my grandfather Luís Cubas; out came the Flemish tablecloths and the big Indian vases; a pig was slaughtered; jams and preserves were ordered from the nuns at the Convento da Ajuda; rooms, stairs, candlesticks, sconces, the vast crystal chandeliers, and all other such luxury items were washed, aired, and polished.",21,RO005TR07
3435,175,"When the moment came, a very select group of people were gathered together: the magistrate, three or four army officers, a few businessmen and men of letters, various civil servants, some with their wives and daughters, others without, but all sharing the same desire to bury the memory of Bonaparte in the turkey stuffing. It wasn’t a supper, it was a Te Deum; so said one of the men of letters present, Dr. Vilaça, a renowned extempore poet, who added a tidbit of poetry to the various dishes served up.",21,RO005TR07
3436,176,"I can remember it as if it were yesterday, I remember seeing him standing up—his silk jacket, emerald ring, long hair tied back in a pigtail—and asking my uncle the priest to give him a suitable text, and then, having repeated it, he would fix his eyes on some lady’s forehead, clear his throat, raise his right hand, and, thus posed and composed, point his index finger up at the ceiling and improvise a poem. He did this not once but three times and swore to the gods never to stop. He would ask for a text and immediately come up with a response, then ask for another and another, until one of the ladies present could not help but express her admiration in gushing terms.",21,RO005TR07
3437,177,"“Ah, senhora,” replied Vilaça modestly, “you only say that because you never heard Bocage as I once did, at the end of the last century, in Lisbon. Ah, what facility! And what poetry too! We would hold battles lasting one or two hours in Nicola’s Tavern, improvising lines to loud applause and cries of, ‘Bravo.’ What an immense talent the man had! Indeed, that’s precisely what the Duquesa de Cadaval said to me just a few days ago . . .”",21,RO005TR07
3438,178,"And that mention of the duquesa, on whose name he placed great emphasis, provoked a tremor of admiration and astonishment. For this amiable, unassuming man not only dueled with poets, he held learned conversations with duchesses! A Bocage and a Cadaval! Being so close to such a man made the ladies feel terribly refined; the men eyed him with respect, some with envy, and not a few with incredulity. He, meanwhile, continued to pile adjective on adjective, adverb on adverb, coming up with endless rhymes for tyrant and potentate. This was over dessert, and no one even thought of eating now.",21,RO005TR07

3440,180,"Now and then, an ample, jovial, unbuttoned laugh would interrupt the political gravity of the banquet. Small, private preoccupations bubbled up among the main and most important topic of interest. The girls discussed the songs they would sing accompanied on the clavichord, and spoke of minuets and quadrilles; there was even the occasional matron who promised to dance a measure or two, just to show how she used to caper about the dance floor when she was a blithe and happy child.",21,RO005TR07

I felt really glad whenever he stopped speaking, hoping each time that it would be the last, but it wasn’t, and the pudding remained there untouched. No one dared interrupt the flow. Seated at the head of the table, my father was drinking in his guests’ enjoyment, seeing himself reflected in the large beaming faces, in the food, in the flowers, delighting in the familiarity that had sprung up between the most unlikely of minds, the effect of a good supper.",21,RO005TR07

And still the verses came, like regular squalls of rain buffeting the window, forcing me to withdraw both my desire and my plea. I tried to be patient, but with little success. I asked for the pudding very quietly, then I roared, yelled, stamped my feet. My father, who would have given me the sun if I’d asked for it, ordered a slave to serve me some pudding, but it was too late. Aunt Emerenciana had hauled me out of my chair and handed me over to a slave-woman, regardless of how much I screamed and struggled.",21,RO005TR07
3445,185,"That was the extemporizer’s only crime: delaying my pudding and causing me to be excluded from the supper. This was enough for me to ponder some act of revenge, and whatever form it took, it needed to be grand and exemplary, guaranteed, in some way, to make him look ridiculous. For Dr. Vilaça was a very serious fellow, slow and measured, a forty-seven-year-old husband and father. It wouldn’t be enough to tie a paper tail to him or give his pigtail a tug; it had to be something much worse. I watched him for the rest of the evening and followed him out into the garden along with all the other guests.

I can see you now walking into the classroom in your white leather slippers and long cape, handkerchief in hand, bald head on display, face clean-shaven; I can see you sitting down, huffing and puffing, taking a first pinch of snuff, then calling us to order. And you did that for twenty-three years, silent, obscure, punctilious, living in a tiny house in Rua do Piolho, never troubling the world with your mediocrity, until one day you took the plunge into darkness, and no one mourned you, apart from an old black slave—no one, not even me, and to you I owe the rudiments of writing.",21,RO005TR07

Two or three times a week he would leave a dead cockroach in the teacher’s trouser pocket or in the drawer of his desk, or next to the inkwell. If the teacher found it during the lesson, he would recoil in disgust, then gaze around him with blazing eyes, and call us every name under the sun: we were worms, rogues, reprobates, villains.

Yes, he was a real jewel, and not just of the school, but of the city too. His mother, a widow of considerable means, adored the boy, spoiled him rotten, and always dressed him impeccably, with a liveried page following behind, a page who allowed us to play truant from school, to go hunting for birds’ nests or chasing lizards on the slopes of Morro do Livramento and Morro da Conceição, or simply to wander the streets like two idle dandies.

Since I affected a rather arrogant air, it was hard to say whether I was a child pretending to be a man, or a man behaving like a child. What it came down to was this: I was a handsome lad, handsome and bold, who rode into life wearing boots and spurs, whip in hand and blood in his veins, mounted on a swift, strong, skittish steed, just like a steed out of an old ballad, the kind the Romantics went looking for in a medieval castle, only to find it here in the streets of our own century. The trouble is, they rode the horse too hard, and, in the end, abandoned it by the roadside, where it was found by the realists, so eaten away by hunger and worms that, out of pity, they carried the beast off into their own novels.",21,RO005TR07
3469,209,"Yes, I was that good-looking, elegant, wealthy young man; and it’s easy to imagine that more than one lady may have gazed at me pensively or looked upon me with covetous eyes. However, the one who immediately enslaved and captivated me was a . . . a . . . well, I’m not sure if I should say quite what; this is, after all, a chaste book, at least in intention; in intention it is utterly chaste. But let’s say it: all or nothing. The woman who captivated me was a Spanish lady, Marcela, “lovely Marcela,” as the boys at the time called her. And they were quite right. She was the daughter of a market gardener from Asturias; she told me so herself, one day when she opened her heart to me, because it was generally held that she was the child of a lawyer from Madrid, who, when she was only twelve years old, fell victim to the French invasion, during which he was wounded, imprisoned, and shot.",21,RO005TR07
3470,210,"Cosas de España. Whoever her father was, though, whether lawyer or market gardener, the truth is that Marcela was entirely lacking in rustic innocence and had only a tenuous grasp of the moral nature of the legal code. She was a sweet, good-humored girl with few scruples, albeit slightly constrained by the stuffy mores of the time, which prevented her from parading her wilder extravagances through the streets; she was flamboyant, impatient, fond of money and young men. That year, she was dying of love for a certain Xavier, who was wealthy and consumptive—a veritable pearl among men.",21,RO005TR07
3471,211,"I saw her for the first time in the Rocio Grande, which was all lit up on the night following the declaration of independence, a spring celebration, an awakening of the public soul. The people and I were like two young lads, as if we had both just left childhood behind us and were full of the fervor and passion of youth. I spotted her getting out of a sedan chair; she looked so elegant, so enchanting, with her slender, curvaceous figure, and a boldness I had never seen in any decent woman. “Follow me,” she said to her page boy. And I followed too, as if I were just another page boy, as if she had given the order to me, and, on that day full of first dawns, I allowed myself to fall wildly in love. Along the way, I heard someone call her “lovely Marcela,” and remembered hearing my Uncle João pronounce that same name, and this thought, I must confess, left me completely dumbstruck.",21,RO005TR07
3472,212,"Three days later, my uncle asked me, in private, if I wanted to go to a “ladies’ supper party” in Cajueiros. We went; it was held at Marcela’s house. Despite his tubercular state, Xavier presided over this nocturnal feast, where I ate little or nothing, for I only had eyes for the mistress of the house. She was so lovely! There were half a dozen other women present, all of them up for grabs and all of them pretty and elegant, but Marcela . . . A mixture of ardor, wine, and my own rash, proud nature, all combined to make me do something quite extraordinary; as we were leaving, when we were already at the street door, I asked my uncle to wait for me for a moment while I went back upstairs.",21,RO005TR07

The truth is that there are two ways to win the heart of a woman: violently, like the bull that abducted Europa, or surreptitiously, like the swan that seduced Leda and the golden rain that impregnated Danaë, to name but three of old Zeus’s inventions, and which, having fallen out of fashion, have been replaced here by the horse and the donkey. I will not describe the plots I hatched, the bribes I paid, nor my alternating moods of confidence and dread, nor the long hours spent waiting in vain, nor any of the other preliminary stages. I will say only that the donkey proved the equal of the gallant steed—a truly philosophical beast, like Sancho Panza’s donkey, who, at the end of those thirty days, led me to her house, where I dismounted, patted him on the rump, and sent him off to graze.",21,RO005TR07

During the first brief phase, Xavier and I ruled in tandem, although he could never quite believe that he was sharing the government of Rome with me; however, when his disbelief had to give way before the evidence, Xavier lay down his badge of office and all the power lay in my hands alone; that was my Julius Caesar phase. Mine was the universe, but alas, it did not come cheaply. I had to acquire money, multiply it, invent it.",21,RO005TR07
3481,221,"Initially, I exploited my father’s generosity; he gave me everything I asked for, without reproach, without delay, with no cooling of his affection for me; he told everyone that I was a young man and that he had once been a young man too. I so abused his generosity, though, that he tightened the purse strings a little, then a little more, then a lot. So I went to my mother and persuaded her to divert some money in my direction, and she did so secretly. But this still wasn’t enough, and so I turned to my last resort: I began taking out loans against my inheritance from my father, signing letters of credit that I would one day have to repay with interest.",21,RO005TR07

3483,223,"And if it was a piece of jewelry, she would say this while holding it up to the light, trying it on and laughing, then kissing me with renewed passion and sincerity; for all her protests, her eyes glowed with happiness, and I felt happy to see her so happy. She was very fond of old gold coins, and I brought her as many as I could lay hands on; she kept them in a small metal box, the key to which was hidden in a place known only to her, for fear her slaves might find it.",21,RO005TR07

It was furnished with good, solid pieces made of carved jacaranda wood, and with all the other usual ornaments, mirrors and vases and silverware—a beautiful set of silverware from India given to her by a judge. Wretched silverware, how you grated on my nerves. I often said as much to its owner, and made no attempt to hide my irritation at the sight of these and other spoils from her previous lovers.",21,RO005TR07
3485,225,"She would listen and laugh, an open, innocent laugh—well, open, innocent, and something else besides, which I didn’t quite understand at the time; when I look back now, I think it was a kind of hybrid laugh, like that of a child born, for example, to one of Shakespeare’s witches and one of Klopstock’s seraphs, if you see what I mean. Being perfectly aware of my retrospective jealousy, she seemed to enjoy adding fuel to the fire. And so one day when I was unable to buy her a particular necklace she had seen in a jeweler’s shop, she replied saying that she had only been joking, and that our love had no need of such vulgar stimulants.",21,RO005TR07

Then, leaning back on the sofa, she continued in the same frank, simple vein. She would never allow anyone to buy her affections. She had often sold the appearance of affection, but never the real thing, which she reserved for the few—Duarte, for example, Ensign Duarte, with whom she had been truly in love two years before. He, like me, had been hard-pushed to afford anything of value; and she had only very reluctantly accepted inexpensive trinkets from him, like the gold cross he gave to her once as a special treat.",21,RO005TR07

3501,241,"Meanwhile, she more than repaid any sacrifices I made; she was alert to my innermost thoughts; I only had to give voice to a desire for her to grant it wholeheartedly, effortlessly, as if out of a profound sense of duty and conscience.

She wasn’t dying, of course, she was living. Living is not the same as dying, as all the jewelers of the world will tell you, and they know about grammar. Beloved jewelers, what would become of love were it not for your baubles and your credit? For you are responsible for a third or a fifth of the universal trade in hearts.",21,RO005TR07

I listened to him in silence and said nothing to oppose his order to depart, as I had on other occasions; I considered taking Marcela with me. I went to see her, laid out the situation before her, and told her what I proposed. Marcela listened to me, staring into space and saying nothing; then, when pressed, she told me she would stay in Rio, that she couldn’t go to Europe.",21,RO005TR07

The servant brought it in on a silver tray, a tray paid for with part of my eleven contos. Marcela politely offered me a sip of her milk, and my response was to knock over both glass and tray, spilling the contents into her lap; the slave-girl shrieked and I yelled at her to leave. Once Marcela and I were alone, I poured out to her my heart’s despair; I told her she was a monster, that she had never loved me, that she had allowed me to sink to the lowest depths, without even the excuse that she genuinely loved me; I called her many more ugly names, accompanied by just as many wild gesticulations.",21,RO005TR07

And I might actually have done so had the exact opposite not happened, and instead I was the one who knelt before her, contrite and supplicant; I kissed her feet, recalled the months of our solitary bliss, repeated the loving names we once called each other. Breathless, half mad, I sat on the floor with my head resting on her knees, my hands clutching hers, as I begged her tearfully not to leave me . . .

That savior of an idea swung back and forth on it, just as the idea of the poultice had (see Chapter II). It was this: I must charm her, seduce her, dazzle her, entice her; it occurred to me that I must use something more concrete than mere supplicant words. I did not pause to weigh up the consequences; I took out one last loan; I went to Rua dos Ourives, bought the finest piece of jewelry in the city—three large diamonds set in an ivory hair comb—and ran to Marcela’s house.",21,RO005TR07
3530,270,"Marcela was lounging in a hammock, eyes half closed, in an attitude of weary languor, her abundant hair hanging loose, one leg dangling over the edge to reveal a small silk-stockinged foot.",21,RO005TR07
3531,271,"“Come with me,” I said, “I’ve found a way. We have lots of money now, and you will have everything you could possibly want. Look, this is for you.”",21,RO005TR07
3532,272,"And I showed her the diamond-encrusted hair comb. Marcela started slightly, half sat up, and, leaning on one elbow, studied the comb for a few brief moments, before looking away, trying to control her feelings. Then I gathered up her hair in my hands, quickly wound it into an untidy, improvised coiffure, and pinned it in place with the bejeweled comb; I took a step back, then moved closer again, primping and preening, trying to impose some symmetry on that disorder, and I did so with all the thoroughness of a loving mother.",21,RO005TR07
3533,273,"“There you are,” I said.",21,RO005TR07
3534,274,"“You’re mad,” was her first response.",21,RO005TR07
3535,275,"Her second was to draw me toward her and repay my sacrifice with the most ardent of kisses. Then she removed the hair comb and spent a long time admiring the materials and the craftsmanship, occasionally glancing over at me and shaking her head reprovingly:",21,RO005TR07
3536,276,“What am I going to do with you?” she said.,21,RO005TR07
3537,277,“Will you come to Europe with me?”,21,RO005TR07
3538,278,"Marcela thought for a moment. I didn’t like the look on her face as she glanced from me to the wall and from the wall to the comb, but my unease vanished when she declared resolutely:",21,RO005TR07
3539,279,“I’ll come. When do you leave?”,21,RO005TR07
3540,280,“In two or three days’ time.”,21,RO005TR07
3541,281,“I’ll be there.”,21,RO005TR07
3542,282,"I thanked her on bended knee. I had rediscovered the Marcela I had known at the very beginning of our relationship, and I told her so; she smiled and went to put away the comb while I went down the stairs.",21,RO005TR07
3543,283,CHAPTER XVIII,21,RO005TR07
3544,284,Vision in the corridor,21,RO005TR07
3545,285,"AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, at the end of the dark corridor, I paused for a while to breathe and to think, to gather together my scattered thoughts and recover from all those profound and contrary emotions. I felt happy. It’s true that the diamonds rather marred my happiness, but it’s equally true that a pretty lady has no difficulty in loving both the Greek and his gifts. And besides, I trusted my good, kind Marcela; she might have her faults, but she loved me . . .",21,RO005TR07
3546,286,"“An angel!” I murmured to myself, staring up at the corridor ceiling.",21,RO005TR07
3547,287,"And there, like a scornful joke, I saw again the look in Marcela’s eyes, the look that, shortly before, had filled me with just the shadow of doubt, and which glinted now above a nose, which was, simultaneously, Bakbarah’s nose and mine. Bakbarah, the disappointed lover from The Thousand and One Nights! I could see him haring down the long gallery after the vizier’s wife, who kept beckoning him on with the promise that he would have her; on he ran until he came to a long avenue, and emerged out onto the street to be met by all the town’s curriers, who mocked and beat him.",21,RO005TR07
3548,288,"Then it seemed to me that Marcela’s corridor was that same avenue, and the street was that same Baghdad street. Indeed, when I looked out of the door, I saw on the sidewalk three of those curriers, one wearing a cassock, one in livery, the other in civilian clothes, and all three entered the hallway, grabbed my arms, and bundled me into a carriage, my father on my right, my uncle the canon on my left, and the man in livery in the driver’s seat. They then took me to the police chief’s house, whence I was transported to a ship bound for Lisbon. As you can imagine, I put up a fierce resistance, but all resistance was in vain.",21,RO005TR07
3549,289,"Three days later, we crossed the bar and reached the open sea; I was downcast and dumb. I didn’t even cry; I had but one idée fixe . . . Cursèd be those idées fixes! That particular idée was that I should plunge into the ocean, calling out Marcela’s name.",21,RO005TR07
3550,290,CHAPTER XIX,21,RO005TR07
3551,291,On board,21,RO005TR07
3552,292,"THERE WERE ELEVEN of us passengers in all, a madman accompanied by his wife, two young men going to Lisbon as tourists, four businessmen, and two servants. My father had entrusted me to the care of all these individuals, in particular the captain, who had enough cares of his own, since, apart from anything else, his wife, who was traveling with him, was in the final stages of consumption.",21,RO005TR07
3553,293,"I don’t know if the captain had some inkling of my grim plan or if my father had forewarned him, I only know that he never took his eyes off me and kept me with him at all times. When he himself could not be at my side, he would have me keep his wife company. His wife spent most of the time lying on a low chaise longue, coughing a lot and assuring me that she would show me the sights of Lisbon. She wasn’t just thin, she was transparent; it seemed impossible that she would survive from one moment to the next. Perhaps in order to deceive himself, the captain pretended not to believe in her imminent death. I neither knew nor gave the matter any thought. What did I care about the fate of a consumptive woman on a ship in the middle of the ocean? For me the world was Marcela.",21,RO005TR07
3554,294,"One night, at the end of the first week, I found a propitious moment to die. I crept cautiously up on deck, but there I found the captain standing at the ship’s rail, his eyes fixed on the horizon.",21,RO005TR07
3555,295,“Is there a storm brewing?” I asked.,21,RO005TR07
3556,296,"“No,” he said with a tremor. “No, I was simply admiring the splendor of the night. Regard this truly celestial sight!”",21,RO005TR07
3557,297,"His words belied the man, for he was rather coarse in appearance and not someone from whom you would expect such flowery language. I stared at him, and he seemed to enjoy my look of surprise. After a few seconds, he took my hand and pointed up at the moon, asking why I did not write an ode to the night; this, I replied, was because I was not a poet. The captain muttered something or other, then, taking a step back, put his hand in his pocket, drew out a very crumpled piece of paper, and, by the light of a lantern, read a Horatian ode about the freedom of life at sea. It was his own work.",21,RO005TR07
3558,298,“What do you think?”,21,RO005TR07
3559,299,"I can’t remember now what I said; I do remember that he shook my hand very firmly and thanked me profusely; then he recited two sonnets, and was about to recite another when he received a summons to his wife’s bedside.",21,RO005TR07
3560,300,"“Just coming,” he said, and slowly, lovingly recited the third sonnet.",21,RO005TR07
3561,301,"I was left alone, but the captain’s muse had swept all dark thoughts from my mind; I chose instead to sleep, which is a kind of interim death. The following day, we woke to a storm that terrified everyone, apart from the madman; he started prancing about, saying that his daughter had sent for a carriage to take him away, for the cause of his madness had been the death of a daughter. No, I will never forget the dreadful sight of that poor man, in the midst of the other frightened passengers and the howling gale, singing and dancing, his eyes starting from his pale face, his hair long and disheveled.",21,RO005TR07
3562,302,"He would stop sometimes, hold up his bony hands, and make crosses and circles with his fingers, all the while laughing loudly, desperately. His wife no longer had time to watch over him; consumed by the fear that she might die, she was busy praying to all the saints in heaven. Finally, the storm eased, and I must confess that the storm proved an excellent diversion for my heart. Having considered going to meet death of my own volition, I had not dared to look her in the face when she came to meet me.",21,RO005TR07
3563,303,"The captain asked if I’d been afraid, if I’d felt that my life was in danger, or if I had found the spectacle of the storm sublime, and he asked this with all the genuine interest of a friend. The conversation then inevitably turned to life at sea; he asked if I enjoyed piscatorial idylls; I responded innocently that I had no idea what such things were.",21,RO005TR07
3564,304,"“You’ll see,” he said.",21,RO005TR07
3565,305,"He recited a short poem, then another—an eclogue—and finally five sonnets, with which he brought that day of literary confidences to a close. The following day, before reciting anything, he explained that only the gravest of reasons had made him embrace the maritime life, because his grandmother had wanted him to be a priest, and he did indeed have some knowledge of Latin; while he never did become a priest, he had never ceased to be a poet, which was his true vocation.",21,RO005TR07
3566,306,"To prove this, he stood there and immediately reeled off a hundred or so lines. I noticed a strange phenomenon: he gesticulated so wildly that, once, I even burst out laughing; but when he was reciting, the captain’s gaze was so inward-looking that he neither saw nor heard anything.",21,RO005TR07
3567,307,"The days passed, as did the sea and the poems, and with them the life of the captain’s wife. She was at death’s door. One day, just after breakfast, the captain told me that she might not last the week.",21,RO005TR07
3568,308,“Surely not!” I cried.,21,RO005TR07
3569,309,"“Yes, she had a very bad night.”",21,RO005TR07
3570,310,"I went to see her, and did indeed find her very close to death, but still she talked of resting up in Lisbon for a few days before traveling with me to Coimbra, because she was determined to accompany me to the university there. I felt deeply troubled when I left her, and joined her husband watching the lapping waves as they broke and died against the ship’s side. I tried my best to console him. He thanked me and told me the story of their love, praised his wife’s faithfulness and devotion, recalled poems he had written for her, and recited them to me. Then someone came with a message from his wife, and we both ran to see her. Her illness had reached a crisis point. That day and the next were cruel in the extreme; on the third day she died; I fled the whole spectacle, finding it repugnant. Half an hour later, I came across the captain sitting on a pile of ropes, head in hands, and offered him some words of comfort.",21,RO005TR07
3571,311,"“She died like a saint,” he said, and so that these words could not be taken as a sign of weakness, he immediately stood up, shook his head, and stared long and hard at the horizon. “Come,” he added, “let us deliver her to the grave that will never again open.”",21,RO005TR07
3572,312,"A few hours later, after the usual ceremonies, her body was launched into the sea. Everyone’s face was drawn and gray with sadness; the widower resembled a rock split asunder by a bolt of lightning. A great silence fell. The wave opened its breast, received his wife’s mortal remains, and closed, leaving only a slight ripple on the surface; then the ship sailed on. I stayed at the stern for a few minutes, my eyes fixed on the uncertain point in the sea where one of our number would forever remain . . . Then I went to find the captain, to try and distract him.",21,RO005TR07
3573,313,"“Thank you,” he said, sensing why I had come. “I don’t think I will ever forget your kindness. God will reward you. Ah, poor Leocádia, think of us when you are in heaven.”",21,RO005TR07
3574,314,"He wiped away an importunate tear with his sleeve; I sought distraction in poetry, which was his passion. I spoke of the poems he had read to me and offered to publish them. His eyes brightened a little.",21,RO005TR07
3575,315,"“I might accept your offer,” he said, “but I’m not sure. They’re pretty feeble stuff.”",21,RO005TR07
3576,316,I assured him that they were no such thing and asked him to collect them together and give them to me before I disembarked.,21,RO005TR07
3577,317,"“Poor Leocádia!” he murmured, without responding to my request. “A corpse . . . the sea . . . the sky . . . the ship . . .”",21,RO005TR07
3578,318,"The following day, he came and read me an elegy he had just written, and which commemorated the circumstances of his wife’s death and burial; he read it to me, his hand and voice tremulous with emotion; afterward, he asked if I thought his verses were worthy of the treasure he had lost.",21,RO005TR07
3579,319,"“They are,” I said.",21,RO005TR07
3580,320,"“They may not be very inspired,” he said after a moment, “but no one could say they lack feeling, unless, of course, feeling mars perfection . . .”",21,RO005TR07
3581,321,“I don’t think so. To me they’re perfect.”,21,RO005TR07
3582,322,"“Yes, I do believe . . . but they are the work of a mere sailor.”",21,RO005TR07
3583,323,“A sailor-poet.”,21,RO005TR07
3584,324,"He shrugged, looked down at the piece of paper, and again read out his poem, this time with no tremor in his voice, and giving due weight to his literary intentions, conscious of the images and the cadence of the lines. When he had finished, he declared that it was his most polished piece, and I agreed; he clasped my hand and predicted a great future ahead of me.",21,RO005TR07
3585,325,CHAPTER XX,21,RO005TR07
3586,326,I graduate,21,RO005TR07
3587,327,"A GREAT FUTURE! While these words were still ringing in my ears, I turned my eyes to the distant, vague, mysterious horizon. One idea drove out the other, ambition unseated Marcela. A great future? Perhaps as a naturalist, a writer, an archaeologist, a banker, a politician, or even a bishop, yes, why not, any profession would do as long as it brought prominence, reputation, and an exalted position. Farewell, love! Farewell, Marcela! Farewell, wild nights, priceless jewels, an undisciplined life! It’s a life of hard work and glory for me now; I hereby consign to oblivion the short pants of boyhood.",21,RO005TR07
3588,328,"And so it was that I disembarked in Lisbon and traveled on to Coimbra. The university awaited me with its many demanding subjects; I studied them in a very mediocre fashion, and yet I still graduated with a bachelor’s degree; they bestowed this upon me with due solemnity after the required number of years had passed; it was a beautiful ceremony that filled me with pride and nostalgia—mainly nostalgia. In Coimbra I had become famous as a reveler; a profligate, superficial, riotous, insolent student, much given to love affairs, a romantic in practice and a liberal in theory, living according to a pure faith in a pair of dark eyes and a written constitution.",21,RO005TR07
3589,329,"On the day when the university credited me, on parchment, with a knowledge that had certainly not put down any deep roots in my brain, I admit that I felt in a way cheated, although proud too. Let me explain: the diploma was a letter of manumission; it gave me freedom, but it also gave me responsibility. I put it to one side, left the banks of the Mondego, and came away feeling distinctly sad, but already filled with an impulse, a curiosity, a desire to elbow others aside, to influence people, to enjoy myself, to live—in short, to prolong university life for the foreseeable future . . .",21,RO005TR07
3590,330,CHAPTER XXI,21,RO005TR07
3591,331,The muleteer,21,RO005TR07
3592,332,"THE MULE I was riding on stopped dead in his tracks and refused to move, then he bucked twice, then another three times, then once again, and that last time he threw me out of the saddle, but my left foot remained caught in the stirrup; I tried to cling onto the mule’s belly, but, startled, the beast set off at a gallop down the road. No, that’s not quite true: the mule tried to run away and even made a couple of leaps forward, but the muleteer, who happened to be standing beside me, managed to grab the reins, and, with considerable effort and no little danger to himself, brought the animal to a halt. Once the mule was under control again, I extricated my foot from the stirrup and stood up.",21,RO005TR07
3593,333,"“A lucky escape,” said the muleteer.",21,RO005TR07
3594,334,"And it was true; if the mule had galloped off, I would have got a real battering, and that accident might well have ended in my death, my head cracked open, congestion of the brain or some other internal injury, and that would have been the end of my career. The muleteer had perhaps saved my life, that much was clear; I could feel it in the blood pounding in my heart. O worthy muleteer! While I was recovering, he was carefully, skillfully untangling the mule’s harness. I decided to give him three of the gold coins I had with me, not because that was how much my life was worth—for my life was of inestimable value—but because it seemed a reward worthy of the devotion he had shown in saving me. Right, I thought, I’ll give him the three gold coins.",21,RO005TR07
3595,335,"“There you are,” he said, handing me the reins.",21,RO005TR07
3596,336,"“Just a moment,” I answered, “I haven’t quite got over the shock . . .”",21,RO005TR07
3597,337,“Really?”,21,RO005TR07
3598,338,"“Well, I did nearly die, didn’t I?”",21,RO005TR07
3599,339,"“If the mule had galloped off, yes, possibly, but as you see, with God’s help, nothing happened.”",21,RO005TR07
3600,340,"I went over to the saddlebags and took out an old vest, in whose pocket I had placed the five gold coins, and while I was doing this, I wondered whether perhaps that wasn’t too large a tip and whether two coins would be perfectly adequate. Or even one. One coin would be enough to send a tremor of joy through him. I studied his clothes; he was a poor wretch who had probably never even seen a gold coin. So, yes, one gold coin would suffice. I took it out, saw it sparkle in the sunlight; the muleteer didn’t see it, though, because I had turned my back on him; but maybe he had his suspicions, because he started talking to the mule in a low, meaningful voice, giving him advice, telling him to be more sensible in the future, saying that the gentleman might punish him; in short, a brief fatherly monologue. Bless me if I didn’t hear the sound of a kiss: it was the muleteer kissing the mule on its head.",21,RO005TR07
3601,341,“Steady on!” I exclaimed.,21,RO005TR07
3602,342,"“Sorry, sir, but the creature keeps looking at us in such an odd way . . .”",21,RO005TR07
3603,343,"I laughed, I hesitated, I placed in his hand a silver coin, got back on the mule, and trotted off, feeling slightly vexed, or, rather, slightly uncertain as to the effect that silver coin would have. A few yards on, I looked back, and there was the muleteer still bowing and clearly as pleased as punch. I realized that he must be very happy indeed; I had paid him well, I had perhaps paid him too well. I thrust my fingers into the pocket of the vest I was wearing and felt a few copper coins—the small change I should have given to the muleteer, instead of the silver coin.",21,RO005TR07
3604,344,"After all, when I thought about it, he hadn’t acted in the hope of gaining any reward or out of virtue, he had simply responded to an impulse natural to his temperament and to his trade; add to this the fact that he had been neither in front of me nor behind, but precisely at the spot where the accident occurred, and this seemed to make him a mere instrument of Providence; so, one way or another, there had been no merit in his actions at all. I was greatly distressed at this thought; I told myself I had been profligate, and charged that one silver coin to the account of my many former extravagances; I was filled (yes, why not say it?), I was filled with remorse.",21,RO005TR07

3606,346,Return to Rio,21,RO005TR07
3607,347,"WRETCHED MULE, you interrupted my train of thought. Now I will say nothing of what I was thinking from there to Lisbon, nor what I did in Lisbon, in the peninsula as a whole or in other places in Europe, old Europe, which, at the time, seemed to grow young again. No, I will not mention that I was present at the dawn of Romanticism, that I, too, made real-life poetry in the lap of Italy; I will say none of that. That would be more like a diary of my journey, rather than these memoirs, in which only the very substance of life has a place.",21,RO005TR07
3608,348,"After a few years of wandering, I finally hearkened to my father’s pleas: “Come home,” he said in his last letter, “if you don’t come soon, you will find your mother dead!” That last word was a real blow for me. I loved my mother; I could still see the scene, on board ship, when she gave me her final blessing. “My poor, sad son, I will never see you again,” she sobbed, clasping me to her bosom. And those words echoed inside me now, like a prophecy come true.",21,RO005TR07
3609,349,"Note that, at the time, I was in Venice, a Venice still redolent of Lord Byron’s verses; there I was, plunged deep in dreams, reliving the past, believing I was living in the Serenissima Repubblica. It’s true. Once, I even asked an innkeeper if the doge would be making an appearance today. “What doge, signor mio?” I came to my senses, but did not admit to my delusion; I told him that my question was a kind of Brazilian conundrum; he nodded sagely, and added that he really liked Brazilian conundrums. He was, after all, an innkeeper. Anyway, I left all that behind, the innkeeper, the doge, the Bridge of Sighs, the gondola, Lord Byron’s verses, the ladies of the Rialto, I left it all and flew like a bullet to Rio de Janeiro.",21,RO005TR07
3610,350,"I returned home . . . but no, let’s not make this chapter any longer than it is. Sometimes I get carried away when I’m writing, and the pen eats up the paper, much to the detriment of me, the author. Long chapters suit long-winded readers, and ours is not an in-folio readership, but an in-duodecimo one: not much text, wide margins, elegant font, gilt-edged paper, and illustrations . . .

This wasn’t the effect of seeing my political homeland, but, rather, that of revisiting the place of my childhood, the street, the tower, the fountain on the corner, the woman who always wore a mantilla, the black slave who did odd jobs, the objects and sights of infancy engraved on my memory. It was neither more nor less than a rebirth. My mind, like a bird, ignored the passing years, and flew off to the source, to drink its cool, pure water, as yet unsullied by the torrent of filth that is life.",21,RO005TR07

The poor woman was suffering horribly, because cancer is indifferent to the virtues of the person thus afflicted; when it gnaws, it gnaws; its job is to gnaw. My sister Sabina, who by then was married to Cotrim, was close to exhaustion, poor girl. She only managed to sleep for three hours a night, at most. Even Uncle João was sad and heavyhearted. Dona Eusébia and a few other ladies were there too, no less sad and no less tender.",21,RO005TR07

It was not so much a face as a skull; all beauty had passed, like a bright summer’s day; all that remained were the bones, which never grow thin. I barely recognized her; we hadn’t seen each other for eight or nine years. Kneeling at her bedside, her hands in mine, I remained dumb and still, not daring to speak, because every word would be a sob, and we feared telling her that the end was nigh. Futile fear! She knew she was about to die; she told me so; the next day, we saw it was true.",21,RO005TR07
3619,359,"The death agony was long, long and cruel, of a meticulous, cold, repetitive cruelty that filled me with grief and astonishment. It was the first time I had seen anyone die. I only knew death by hearsay; at most, I had seen it already turned to stone on the face of some corpse I accompanied to the cemetery, or else I thought of it clothed in the empty rhetoric of the teachers of ancient things: the perfidious death of Julius Caesar, the austere death of Socrates, the proud death of Cato. But this was the first time I had witnessed this duel between being and not-being, death in action, painful, strained, convulsive, stripped of its political, philosophical garb, the death of a loved one.",21,RO005TR07

He was the most perfect of barbers; however long it took him to cut your hair, he never got annoyed; he interspersed his strokes of comb or brush with many rather rude or piquant jokes and jests . . . He had no other philosophy than that. Nor do I. I’m not saying that the university taught me nothing, but I took from it only the formulae, the vocabulary, the skeleton. I treated it as I did Latin; I pocketed three lines by Virgil, two by Horace, and a dozen or so political and moral sayings to be deployed in conversation. I treated them as I did history and jurisprudence. I took from everything only the phraseology, the shell, the ornament . . .",21,RO005TR07
3626,366,"The reader may be shocked by the frankness with which I describe and all but celebrate my own mediocrity, but then frankness is the prime virtue of the dead. In life, the public gaze, conflicting interests, clashing desires oblige us to conceal our old rags, to disguise the snags and patches, to keep from the world the revelations we confide to our own conscience; and the best part of that obligation is when, by fooling others, a man fools himself, because then he avoids feeling shame—which is a horrible emotion, and hypocrisy—which is a loathsome vice.",21,RO005TR07
3627,367,"But it’s so different once you’re dead! Such a relief! Such freedom! You can throw off your cloak, ditch the sequins, slough off the veneer, peel off the paint, discard the decorations, and blithely own up to what you were and have now ceased to be! Because, in short, there are no neighbors, no friends or enemies, no acquaintances, and no strangers; there is no audience at all. The public gaze, that piercing, judgmental gaze, loses its power as soon as we step into death’s territory; I’m not saying that the gaze doesn’t reach as far as here, or continue to examine and judge us, but we don’t care if it does. You gentlemen still living, believe me when I say there is nothing as vast as the scorn of the departed.",21,RO005TR07

3630,370,"OOPS! THERE GOES MY PEN drifting off into overly vehement mode. Let us be simple, as simple as the life I led up in the hills of Tijuca during the first weeks following the death of my mother.",21,RO005TR07
3631,371,"On the seventh day, after the funeral mass, I armed myself with a rifle, a few books, clothes, cigars, and a slave-boy—Prudêncio from Chapter XI—and moved into an old house owned there by my family. My father tried his very hardest to change my mind, but I neither could nor wished to obey him. My sister Sabina wanted me to go and live with her for a while, at least for a couple of weeks; indeed, my brother-in-law, Cotrim, almost dragged me there by force. Cotrim was a decent fellow; he had gone from living a life of dissolution to one of common sense and prudence. Now he traded in imported merchandise, and labored away from morning to night with great passion and perseverance. When he sat by the window in the evenings, stroking his long curly side-whiskers, he was thinking only of work, but he loved his wife and the son they had then and who died a few years later. Some said he was a miser.",21,RO005TR07
3632,372,"I renounced everything; my mind was in a state of shock. I think it was then that I noticed the first stirrings of melancholy, that yellow flower, solitary and sickly, with its subtle, intoxicating scent. “ ’Tis good to be sad and say nothing.” When I first read those words by Shakespeare, I confess that I heard in myself an echo, a delicious echo.",21,RO005TR07
3633,373,"I recall that I was sitting beneath a tamarind tree, with a copy of As You Like It open on my lap, and with my mind as glum as my face—or jururu, as we say of chickens when they’re feeling low. I was clutching my own silent grief to my breast, as if that were a feeling unique to me, what you might call the voluptuousness of tedium. The voluptuousness of tedium: remember that expression, dear reader; store it away, scrutinize it, and if you fail to understand it, you may conclude that you have never yet experienced one of the most subtle sensations of this world and of that time.",21,RO005TR07
3634,374,"Sometimes I would go hunting, at others I would sleep or read—I read a lot—and at other times I did nothing at all; I let myself drift from idea to idea, from imagination to imagination, like a vagrant or perhaps a hungry butterfly. The hours passed, drop by drop, the sun set, the shadows of the night covered the mountains and the city. No one visited me, for I had expressly asked to be left alone. However, one day, two days, three days, a whole week like this, without speaking to anyone, were enough to prize me out of Tijuca and back into the hurly-burly of life.",21,RO005TR07
3635,375,"Yes, after seven days, I was sick of solitude; my grief had abated; my mind was no longer contented with my rifle and my books, nor with looking at the trees and the sky. Youth would out, and I needed to live. I packed away in my trunk the problem of life and death, the melancholy of the poet, my shirts, my deep thoughts, my ties, and was just about to close it when my slave-boy Prudêncio told me that, the previous day, an acquaintance of mine had moved into a purple house only a couple of hundred feet from ours.",21,RO005TR07

3639,379,"“Yes, her and her daughter. They arrived yesterday morning.”",21,RO005TR07
3640,380,"I immediately recalled the incident that took place in 1814, and felt troubled, although I noted to myself that subsequent events had proved me right. In fact, it had become impossible not to know about Vilaça’s intimate relations with the sergeant-major’s sister; even before I set off to Europe, there had been mysterious mutterings about the birth of a baby girl. My Uncle João wrote later to tell me that when Vilaça died, he left a large amount of money to Dona Eusébia, something that gave rise to a great deal of talk in the neighborhood.",21,RO005TR07
3641,381,"Indeed, Uncle João, always greedy for gossip and scandal, wrote of nothing else in his letter, which was several pages long. Yes, events had proved me right. And even if they hadn’t, 1814 was a long way off, as were Vilaça, that kiss in the thicket, and my own mischievous intervention. Besides, she and I hardly knew each other. With this thought, I closed the trunk.",21,RO005TR07
3642,382,“Is Massa not going to visit Dona Eusébia?” asked Prudêncio. “She was the one who dressed my mistress’s body when she died.”,21,RO005TR07
3643,383,"I remembered seeing her among the other ladies on the occasion of my mother’s death and funeral; I had no idea, however, that she had performed this final service for my mother.

3651,391,"I hadn’t yet eaten breakfast, and so we ate together. Neither of us mentioned the sad reason for my reclusive state. Only once did we speak of it, and only in passing, when my father spoke of the Regency: it was then that he mentioned the letter of condolence sent to him by one of the regents. He had the letter with him, and it was already looking somewhat crumpled, doubtless because he had read it out to many other people. It was, as I believe I said, from one of the regents. He read the letter to me twice.",21,RO005TR07

3655,395,"My father said this in a very measured way, carefully weighing each word, as if to engrave them more deeply on my mind. His proposal, however, went so counter to all my feelings at the time that I had difficulty understanding him. Unabashed, my father repeated his plan, emphasizing the advantages of both the seat in the Chamber and the bride-to-be.",21,RO005TR07

3660,400,"My father laughed, but having laughed, resumed his more serious tone. I needed a career in politics, he said, for a multitude of reasons, which he set out with extraordinary eloquence, illustrating each reason with examples of people we knew. As for the bride-to-be, one look would be enough, for if I saw her, I would not allow a single day to pass, but would immediately ask her father for her hand in marriage.",21,RO005TR07
3661,401,"He tried charm, persuasion, then pressure; I said nothing, but sat there smiling or thinking, sharpening the end of a toothpick or rolling bread crumbs into little balls; in short, I responded to this proposal neither meekly nor rebelliously. I felt too stunned. A part of me was saying, yes, a beautiful wife and a political post were certainly worthy of consideration; but another part of me was saying no; and my mother’s death seemed to me an example of the fragility of all things, of affections, of family . . .",21,RO005TR07

I stayed where I was, at one end of the table, scribbling wildly with a pencil on a piece of paper: a word, a phrase, a line from a poem, a nose, a triangle, and repeated this over and over, completely at random, like this:",21,RO005TR07

Yes, the very same, the lady who, in 1869, would witness my final days and who, before that, a long time before, played a major role in my most intimate feelings. At the time, she was only about fifteen or sixteen; she was perhaps the boldest, most impertinent creature ever born, and certainly the most willful.",21,RO005TR07
3681,421,"I wouldn’t say she was the most beautiful girl of her day, because this isn’t a novel in which the author embellishes reality and closes his eyes to any freckles or pimples, although her face was quite untouched by a single freckle or pimple. She was pretty and fresh, newly formed by nature’s hands, and full of the precarious, eternal magic that one individual passes to another for reasons known only to creation. This was Virgília; very fair-skinned, vain, ignorant, childish, full of mysterious impulses, extremely lazy, and just a little devout—or was her devoutness perhaps fear? Yes, I think it was.",21,RO005TR07

In fact, she seemed even more grown up. Although she was doubtless still a child when left to her own youthful devices, it seemed to me, seeing her standing there so still and so inscrutable, that she had all the sedate decorum of a married woman, and this perhaps somewhat diminished her virginal grace. Any awkwardness between us soon vanished; her mother praised her to the skies, and I listened with pleasure, while Eugênia smiled, her eyes sparkling, as if a small butterfly with golden wings and diamond eyes were flying around inside her head . . .",21,RO005TR07

That afternoon, I saw the daughter ride past, followed by a page boy; she greeted me with a wave of her whip.

3730,470,"THE FOLLOWING DAY, as I was preparing to go down to the city, a butterfly flew into my room; it was as black as yesterday’s specimen and much bigger. I remembered what had happened then and laughed; I immediately thought of Dona Eusébia’s daughter and how frightened she had been, and how, despite her fear, she had retained her composure. After fluttering around me, the butterfly came to rest on my head. I brushed it off, and it alighted on the windowpane; and when I again brushed it away, it left the window and ended up on an old portrait of my father.",21,RO005TR07
3731,471,"The butterfly was as black as night. There was something slightly impertinent about the slow way it began to move its wings, and I found this extremely irritating. I turned and left the room, but when I came back minutes later and found it still there in the same place, I angrily swatted it with a washcloth, and the butterfly fell to the ground.",21,RO005TR07
3732,472,"It wasn’t dead, though; its body and its sharp little antennae were still twitching. I took pity on it, picked it up in the palm of my hand, and placed it on the windowsill. Too late; within a matter of seconds the poor creature was dead. I still felt slightly irritated and slightly uncomfortable too.",21,RO005TR07
3733,473,“Why couldn’t it have been a blue butterfly?” I said to myself.,21,RO005TR07
3734,474,"And that question—one of the deepest ever asked since butterflies were invented—consoled me for my evil deed and reconciled me with myself. I stood looking at the corpse with, I admit, a certain sympathy. I imagined it leaving the woods, happy and replete. It was a lovely morning. Off it went, modest and black, enjoying itself in its own butterfly way, beneath the vast dome of a blue sky, which is always blue for those that have wings.",21,RO005TR07
3735,475,"It flew in through my window and found me there. I imagine it had never seen a man; it didn’t know, therefore, what a man was; it flew round and round my body, and saw that I moved, had eyes, arms, legs, a divine air about me, and was a veritable colossus. Then it said to itself: “This is probably the inventor of butterflies.”",21,RO005TR07
3736,476,"That idea left it feeling cowed and terrified; but fear, which can be seductive too, suggested that the best way of pleasing its creator would be to kiss him on the forehead, and so it kissed me. When I shooed it off, it landed on the windowpane, and from there saw the portrait of my father, and it’s possible that it may have discovered a half-truth, namely, that this was the father of the inventor of butterflies, and so it flew over to him to plead for mercy.",21,RO005TR07
3737,477,"Then a blow from a washcloth put an end to its adventure. The vast blue sky, the joyful flowers, the splendor of the green leaves, were all defenseless against a mere washcloth, a few square inches of linen. You see how good it is to be superior to butterflies! Because it must be said that its life would have been no safer had it been a blue or orange butterfly; I might well have pierced it with a pin for the simple pleasure of looking at it. Yes, I might well have done that. This last idea brought me fresh consolation, and putting middle finger and thumb together, I flicked the corpse out into the garden. It was high time, for the ever-provident ants were already on their way . . . No, I return to that first idea: I think that butterfly would have been far better off being born blue.",21,RO005TR07

3739,479,Lame since birth,21,RO005TR07
3740,480,"I HAD LEFT DONA EUSÉBIA’S HOUSE in order to make preparations for my return to the city. I won’t delay a moment longer. I’ll go back now, yes, I will, even if some circumspect reader should detain me, asking if the previous chapter was just some piece of nonsense or simply a silly joke. Ah, but I reckoned without Dona Eusébia. I was all ready to leave when she arrived. She had come to invite me to postpone my return and instead join them for supper that evening. I declined, but she was so very insistent that I could hardly refuse; besides, it was the very least I could do. I duly went to supper.",21,RO005TR07
3741,481,"That evening, Eugênia was dressed very plainly—on my account. At least I think it was on my account, unless she often dressed that way. The gold earrings she had worn the day before no longer hung from her ears, those two delicate ears adorning the head of a nymph. A simple white cotton dress, fastened at the neck and wrists not with brooch or bracelet, but with mother-of-pearl buttons.",21,RO005TR07
3742,482,"If her body was simply clothed, her mind was no different. Clear ideas, a no-nonsense manner, a certain natural grace, a ladylike air, and something else too, yes, her mouth, just like her mother’s, which immediately made me think of that incident in 1814, and I felt a sudden desire to blurt out the same words I had as a boy . . .",21,RO005TR07
3743,483,"“Right, now I’ll show you the garden,” said her mother, once we had downed the last drop of coffee.",21,RO005TR07
3744,484,"We went out onto the veranda and into the garden, and it was then that I noticed something. Eugênia had a slight limp, so slight that I asked if she had hurt her foot. The mother said nothing, but the daughter replied without hesitation:",21,RO005TR07
3745,485,"“No, sir, I’ve been lame since birth.”",21,RO005TR07
3746,486,"I cursed myself roundly, calling myself a clumsy oaf, since the mere possibility that she might be lame should have prevented me from asking anything. Then I remembered that the first time I saw her—the day before—she had walked very slowly over to her mother’s chair, and when I arrived that evening, she had already been seated at the supper table. Perhaps she had done so in order to conceal that defect, but in that case, why would she admit it so openly now? I looked at her and saw that she seemed sad.",21,RO005TR07
3747,487,"I tried to erase all trace of my blunder, and this proved easy enough because her mother was, as she herself had said, a bit of a tease, and she and I soon got to talking. We visited the whole garden, the trees and flowers, the duck pond and the laundry tank, and she pointed out and commented on all kinds of other things, while I cast furtive glances at Eugênia’s eyes.",21,RO005TR07
3748,488,"For Eugênia’s gaze was not in the least lame, but very direct and healthy, her eyes dark and serene. On a couple of occasions, those eyes did, I think, look away, slightly embarrassed, but only once or twice; generally, they returned my gaze frankly, fearlessly, and with no pretense at modesty.",21,RO005TR07
3749,489,CHAPTER XXXIII,21,RO005TR07
3750,490,Blessed are those who do not go down to the city,21,RO005TR07
3751,491,"BUT SHE WAS LAME! Such bright eyes, such sweet lips, such ladylike manners; and yet lame! This contrast made me suspect that nature can sometimes be a great joker. Why pretty and yet lame? Why lame and yet pretty? Those were the questions I kept asking myself as I returned home that night, although I failed to come up with a solution to the enigma. When you can’t solve an enigma, the best thing to do is shoo it out of the window; and that is what I did; I grabbed a washcloth and banished this new black butterfly fluttering around in my brain. I felt relieved then and went to bed, but sleep, which is a kind of window into the mind, let the creature fly back in, and so I spent the entire night puzzling over that mystery and reaching no conclusion.",21,RO005TR07
3752,492,"It was raining in the morning, and so I again postponed my return to the city; but even though the next day dawned bright and clear, I still didn’t leave, nor on the third or fourth day, and so it went on until the weekend. Lovely, fresh, inviting mornings; down below, my family was calling to me, along with my bride-to-be, and Parliament, and yet I answered none of them, but sat, bewitched, at the feet of my Lame Venus. Well, “bewitched” is rather too grand a word; there was no bewitching, but, rather, a liking, a certain feeling of physical and moral contentment. I was genuinely fond of her; I felt very at ease beside this simple creature, this illegitimate, lame daughter, the product of love and scorn, and I believe she felt even more at ease with me. And all this was happening in the hills of Tijuca. A simple eclogue. Dona Eusébia kept an eye on us, but not a very close eye, tempering necessity with convenience. In that first explosion of nature, her daughter surrendered her new-flowering soul to me.",21,RO005TR07
3753,493,“Are you going down to the city tomorrow?” she asked me on Saturday.,21,RO005TR07
3754,494,"“I intend to, yes.”",21,RO005TR07
3755,495,“Don’t go.”,21,RO005TR07
3756,496,"And so I didn’t, and thus added a line to the Gospel: “Blessed are those who do not go down to the city, for theirs shall be a young girl’s first kiss.” Indeed, that first kiss from Eugênia happened on the Sunday—the first kiss that any man had ever received from her, and it was not stolen or snatched, but innocently given, as an honest debtor repays a debt. Poor Eugênia! If only you had known what was going through my mind at the time! You, trembling with emotion, your arms about my shoulders, seeing in me your future husband, and me with my eyes fixed on 1814, on that thicket, on Vilaça, and thinking that you could not deny your blood, your origin . . .",21,RO005TR07
3757,497,"Dona Eusébia came into the room unexpectedly, but not so suddenly that she found us in each other’s arms. I went over to the window, and Eugênia sat down to re-plait one of her braids. Such elegant dissembling! Such infinite, delicate art! Such Tartuffian artifice! And all so natural, instinctive, and unstudied, as natural as appetite, as natural as sleep. Just as well! Dona Eusébia did not suspect a thing.",21,RO005TR07
3758,498,CHAPTER XXXIV,21,RO005TR07
3759,499,To a sensitive soul,21,RO005TR07
3760,500,"AMONG THE FIVE OR TEN PEOPLE reading this, there is sure to be one sensitive soul who doubtless feels rather upset by the previous chapter, fearing for Eugênia’s fate and perhaps . . . yes, perhaps, deep inside, he or she is calling me a cynic. Me, a cynic, O sensitive soul? By the goddess Diana’s thigh, that insult deserves to be washed away with blood, if blood ever washed anything away in this world.",21,RO005TR07
3761,501,"No, sensitive soul, I was not a cynic, I was simply a man; my brain was a stage on which all kinds of plays were performed: dramas sacred, austere, and sentimental, elegant comedies, wild farces, morality plays, burlesques, a real pandemonium, O sensitive soul, a true hodgepodge of things and people, in which you could see everything from the rose of Smyrna to the rue growing in your own backyard, from Cleopatra’s magnificent bed to the corner of a beach where a beggar lies shivering in his sleep.",21,RO005TR07
3762,502,"The thoughts going through my brain were of the most various types and conditions. It was not an atmosphere suited only to the eagle and the hummingbird, but to the slug and the toad too. So, sensitive soul, retract that word “cynic,” get a grip on your nerves, polish your spectacles—because these things are often the fault of our spectacles—and let us be done once and for all with this flower of the thicket.",21,RO005TR07
3763,503,CHAPTER XXXV,21,RO005TR07
3764,504,The road to Damascus,21,RO005TR07
3765,505,"NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT, eight days later, as I was on the road to Damascus, I heard a mysterious voice, whispering these words from the Scriptures (Acts 9:7): “Arise and go into the city.” The voice came from me, and had two origins: pity, for I was utterly disarmed by Eugênia’s candor, and terror that I might actually grow to love her and marry her. I mean, really, a lame wife! As to the reason for my departure, she clearly found it out and said as much. We were on the veranda, on a Monday afternoon, when I told her I would be going down to the city the next morning.",21,RO005TR07
3766,506,"“Goodbye,” she said, frankly holding out her hand to me, “you’re quite right to leave.” And when I said nothing, she went on: “You’re quite right to run away from the ridiculous possibility of marrying me.”",21,RO005TR07
3767,507,"I was about to deny this, but she very slowly withdrew, choking back her tears. I ran after her, and swore by all the saints in heaven that I had to go, but that I nevertheless loved her deeply; futile hyperboles, to which she listened in silence.",21,RO005TR07
3768,508,“Do you believe me?” I asked at last.,21,RO005TR07
3769,509,"“No, and, as I said, you’re quite right to leave.”",21,RO005TR07
3770,510,"I tried to keep her there; however, the look she gave me was no longer pleading, but imperious. I left Tijuca the next morning, feeling slightly resentful and slightly pleased. I had been telling myself it was my duty to obey my father, that it was time to embrace a career in politics . . . There was the constitution to consider . . . My bride-to-be . . . My horse . . .",21,RO005TR07
3771,511,CHAPTER XXXVI,21,RO005TR07
3772,512,On the subject of boots,21,RO005TR07
3773,513,"MY FATHER, who wasn’t expecting me, embraced me warmly and gratefully. “Are you here to stay now?” he said. “May I at last . . . ?”",21,RO005TR07
3774,514,,21,RO005TR07
3775,515,"I left him with that unfinished question on his lips, and went to my room to remove my boots, which were pinching my feet. Once they were off, I gave a long sigh of relief, and lay down on the bed, while my feet, and me with them, entered into a state of relative bliss. It occurred to me that tight boots are one of Earth’s great good fortunes because, by pinching our feet, they then afford us the pleasure of taking them off.",21,RO005TR07
3776,516,"First, torture your feet, wretch, then untorture them, and you have yourself a very cheap form of happiness, one very much to the taste of both cobblers and Epicurus. While this idea was working away on my famous trapeze, I glanced up at Tijuca, and saw the little cripple disappearing over the horizon of the past, and felt that my heart would also soon take off its boots. And that is precisely what the lascivious organ did.",21,RO005TR07
3777,517,"A few days later, I was savoring the brief, ineffable, irrepressible moment of delight that always follows any sharp pain, any momentary anxiety or embarrassment . . . I concluded that life is the most ingenious of phenomena, because it prompts a pang of hunger only in order to trigger an occasion to eat, and only invented corns as a way of perfecting earthly happiness. Verily I say unto you that the whole of human wisdom is not worth a pair of tight boots.",21,RO005TR07
3778,518,"You, dear Eugênia, never took your boots off; you walked down the path of life, lame in one leg and lame in love, as sad as a pauper’s funeral, solitary, silent, slow, until you, too, crossed over to this other shore . . . What I don’t know is this: Was your existence really necessary to the century? Who knows? Perhaps the human tragedy would have proved a complete flop had it not included your walk-on part.",21,RO005TR07

3780,520,At last!,21,RO005TR07
3781,521,"AT LAST we get to Virgília! Before going to Counselor Dutra’s house, I asked my father if there had been some agreement prior to the marriage.",21,RO005TR07
3782,522,"“No, no agreement. I happened to be talking to him about you some time ago, and mentioned my desire to see you become a deputy one day; and I spoke so earnestly that he promised to pull a few strings, and I think he will. As for your bride-to-be, which is the name I give to the young lady, who is a jewel, a flower, a star, a rarity . . . she is his daughter; it just occurred to me that if you married her, you would become a deputy more quickly.”",21,RO005TR07
3783,523,“And that’s it?”,21,RO005TR07
3784,524,"“Yes, that’s it.”",21,RO005TR07
3785,525,"We then went straight to Dutra’s house. He was a pearl among men, merry, jovial, patriotic, slightly troubled by the country’s various ills, but in no desperate hurry to put them right. He judged me to be a legitimate candidate, but felt it best to wait a few months. Then he introduced me to his wife—an estimable lady—and to his daughter, who entirely lived up to my father’s panegyric. I mean it. Reread Chapter XXVII. I, who had certain ideas about the young woman, eyed her in a particular way; she, who may or may not have shared such ideas, eyed me in exactly the same way; and that first exchange of glances was purely and simply conjugal. Before a month was out, we were on intimate terms.",21,RO005TR07

3788,528,"“COME AND HAVE SUPPER with us tomorrow,” Dutra said to me one night.",21,RO005TR07
3789,529,"I accepted his invitation. The following day, I ordered the carriage to wait for me in Largo de São Francisco de Paula, and went for a stroll around town. Do you remember my theory about human editions? Well, by then I was in my fourth edition, revised and amended, but still infested with mistakes and barbarisms, a defect that found some compensation in the elegant setting and the lavish binding. Having taken a few turns about the streets, I was walking down Rua dos Ourives when I consulted my watch, only to have its glass face drop onto the pavement. I went into the first jeweler’s shop I found, which turned out to be little more than a cramped room, dusty and dark.",21,RO005TR07
3790,530,"At the back, behind the counter, sat a woman whose sallow, pockmarked face I could not at first make out, but as soon as I did, she proved to be a curious sight. She had obviously not been ugly; on the contrary, she had clearly once been pretty, and not just pretty, either; but illness and premature old age had laid waste to all her youthful charms. The smallpox had left many large and terrible marks, mounds and indentations, hills and valleys, and her skin resembled nothing so much as sandpaper, extremely coarse sandpaper.",21,RO005TR07
3791,531,"Her eyes were her best feature, but there was something strange and repellent about their expression, which changed as soon as I began to speak. As for her hair, it was gray and almost as dusty as the shop doorway. A diamond glittered on the finger of her left hand. Can you believe it, O posterity? That woman was Marcela.",21,RO005TR07
3792,532,"I didn’t recognize her at once, which was hardly surprising; she, however, recognized me as soon as I spoke. Her eyes sparkled and exchanged their usual expression for another, half tender, half sad. I saw a desire in her to hide or flee; a twinge of vanity that lasted no more than a second. Then Marcela resigned herself to the situation and smiled.",21,RO005TR07
3793,533,"“Do you want to buy something?” she said, holding out her hand to me.",21,RO005TR07
3794,534,"I did not reply. Marcela understood the reason for my silence (not difficult) and only hesitated, I think, because she was unable to choose between which was the stronger emotion: her astonishment at the present moment or her memory of the past. She offered me a chair and, with the counter between us, spoke for a long time about herself, the life she had led, the tears she had shed over me, her regrets, the disasters that had befallen her, and finally the smallpox that had ravaged her face, that and time, which had only made matters worse, accelerating her decay.",21,RO005TR07
3795,535,"Her heart truly lay in ruins. She had sold everything, or almost everything; a man, whom she had once loved, and who had died in her arms, had left her that jeweler’s shop, but, just to complete her misfortunes, it now had few customers, perhaps because people found it odd that a woman was in charge. She then asked me to tell her about my life. This took little time, and was neither long, nor interesting.",21,RO005TR07
3796,536,“Are you married?” asked Marcela when I had finished.,21,RO005TR07
3797,537,"“Not yet,” I said rather curtly.",21,RO005TR07
3798,538,"Marcela looked out at the street, with the blank gaze of someone thinking or remembering; I allowed my mind to wander off into the past and, in the midst of memories and regrets, I wondered how I could have been so foolish. She certainly wasn’t the Marcela of 1822, but had that lost beauty merited even a fraction of the sacrifices I had made? That was what I wanted to know as I interrogated Marcela’s face. Her face told me no, and, at the same time, her eyes were telling me that, then as now, what burned in them was the flame of greed. My eyes, my first-edition eyes, had been incapable of seeing that.",21,RO005TR07
3799,539,"“But what made you come in here? Did you see me from the street?” she asked, as if emerging from a torpor.",21,RO005TR07
3800,540,"“No, I thought this was just another jeweler’s shop. I wanted to buy a new glass face for my watch, but I’ll go somewhere else. Forgive me. I’m in a hurry.”",21,RO005TR07
3801,541,"Marcela sighed sadly. The truth is I felt both touched and irritated, and longed to escape. Marcela, however, summoned a slave-boy, gave him the watch, and, despite my protests, sent him off to a neighboring shop to buy the glass. I had no choice but to sit down again. She told me then that she hoped to enjoy the protection of acquaintances from the old days; she assumed that sooner or later it was only natural I would marry, and promised she would provide me with fine jewels at bargain prices.",21,RO005TR07
3802,542,"She didn’t say “bargain prices,” but used a delicate, transparent metaphor. I began to suspect that she hadn’t in fact suffered any misfortune at all (apart from her illness), that she had plenty of money, and continued to work simply to assuage her passion for wealth, which was the worm that had always gnawed at her life; or so, at least, I was told later.",21,RO005TR07

3804,544,The neighbor,21,RO005TR07

3806,546,“Had a good morning?” he asked Marcela.,21,RO005TR07
3807,547,"“So-so. Come here, Maricota.”",21,RO005TR07

Say hello to the lady. If you don’t, I’ll take the cane to you. That’s it. You should hear her at home, she talks about you all the time, and yet here she’s like a little half-wit. Why, just yesterday . . . Shall I tell her, Maricota?”",21,RO005TR07
3810,550,"“No, Papa, don’t.”",21,RO005TR07

3816,556,"“He’s a watchmaker and has a shop nearby. He’s a kind man, as is his wife, and the daughter’s a real poppet, isn’t she? They seem to really like me. They’re good people.”",21,RO005TR07
3817,557,"And when she said these words, there was a tremor of joy in Marcela’s voice, and her face was filled with a look of something almost like happiness . . .",21,RO005TR07

3819,559,In the carriage,21,RO005TR07
3820,560,"AT THIS POINT, the slave-boy returned, bringing my watch fitted with a new glass face. It was time to leave; I couldn’t wait; I gave a silver coin to the slave-boy, and told Marcela I would come back another day, then left as fast as I could. To be perfectly honest, my heart was beating hard, but it felt like a kind of death knell. My mind was full of contradictory impressions. The day had begun on a very positive note.",21,RO005TR07
3821,561,"Over breakfast, my father, in anticipation, had delivered his improvised version of my first speech in the Chamber of Deputies; we laughed a lot, and the sun laughed too, shining as brightly as it did on the most beautiful of days; just as Virgília would laugh when I told her about that breakfast japing. And then I dropped my watch, went into the first jeweler’s shop I came upon, only to find the past rising up before me, lacerating me, kissing me, interrogating me, its face scarred with regrets and pockmarks . . .",21,RO005TR07
3822,562,"And there I left it; I bundled myself into the carriage waiting for me on Largo de São Francisco de Paula, and ordered the driver to drive as fast as he could. He urged on the horses, the carriage jolted me about, the springs creaked, the wheels cut through the mud left by the recent rain, and yet I felt as if I weren’t moving at all.",21,RO005TR07
3823,563,"Have you ever experienced a certain tepid wind, neither strong nor harsh, but stifling, which doesn’t blow the hat off your head or set women’s skirts whirling, and yet it is or seems to be far worse than if it did both those things, because it disheartens and dispirits and seems to dissolve the mind? Well, that was the kind of wind I could feel blowing inside me; and, convinced that this was because I was stuck in that gorge between past and present, I longed to emerge onto the plain of the future. The trouble was, the carriage wasn’t moving.",21,RO005TR07

3827,567,The hallucination,21,RO005TR07
3828,568,"IT WAS TRUE. I hurried in to find Virgília looking anxious and irritated, a frown on her face. Her mother, who was deaf, was in the room with her. Once we had exchanged greetings, Virgília said rather tartly:",21,RO005TR07
3829,569,“We were expecting you to be here earlier.”,21,RO005TR07
3830,570,"I made my excuses as best I could; I blamed a horse that had stubbornly refused to move, a friend who had delayed me. Suddenly, though, my voice died on my lips, I was struck dumb with amazement. Virgília . . . could that girl be Virgília? I stared at her hard, and was so horrified that I took a step back and averted my gaze. Then I looked at her again. Her face was eaten away by pockmarks; her skin, which, the previous day, had been so fine and rosy and pure, appeared now to be sallow and disfigured by the same pestilent disease that had devastated Marcela’s face. Her mischievous eyes had grown dull, her lips sad and weary. I looked more closely; I took her hand and gently drew her nearer. I was right; they were pockmarks. I think I may even have recoiled.",21,RO005TR07
3831,571,"Virgília moved away and went and sat on the sofa. I stood for a while, staring down at my own feet. Should I leave or stay? I rejected the first option as being quite simply absurd, and walked over to Virgília, who was sitting in silence. Thank heavens! She was once again Virgília in the first fresh bloom of youth. I scrutinized her face for some sign of the disease, but found none; her skin was as fine and white as usual.",21,RO005TR07

3834,574,"I sat down, and Virgília said nothing, but kept clicking her nails. A few more seconds passed. I spoke of other things; however, she did not reply or even glance at me. Apart from the sound of clicking, she remained a monument to silence. Only once did she deign to rest her eyes on me, albeit very haughtily, at the same time raising the left corner of her mouth slightly and frowning so that her eyebrows almost met in the middle; all of which gave her face an expression halfway between comic and tragic.",21,RO005TR07
3835,575,"There was something affected about her reaction, something unnatural. Inside, she was suffering, possibly quite a lot—although whether she felt genuinely wounded or was merely somewhat miffed, I cannot say; but because the pain one conceals always hurts more, it’s highly likely that Virgília was suffering twice what she was actually suffering. But there, I think, we are straying into the realm of metaphysics.",21,RO005TR07

3839,579,"On receiving a nudge from the past, Marcela rolled along until she met Brás Cubas, and he, succumbing to that initial impetus, also started rolling until he bumped into Virgília, who had nothing whatsoever to do with the first ball; and this, by the simple transmission of energy, is how the social extremes meet and establish something we might call—the solidarity of human apathy.

There was no spat, no pressure from the family. One day, Dutra came to tell me that I should wait for another opportunity, because Lobo Neves’s candidacy was supported by some very big names. I agreed, and that was the beginning of my downfall. A week later, a smiling Virgília asked Lobo Neves when he would become a minister.",21,RO005TR07

He had built so many castles in the air, so many dreams, that he could not bear to see them crumble just like that, not without his whole organism suffering some terrible shock. At first he refused to believe it. A Cubas! A branch from the illustrious Cubas family tree! And he said this with such conviction that I, who, by then, knew about our barrel-making ancestors, momentarily forgot all about the fickle Virgília in order to contemplate this phenomenon, which wasn’t so much rare as curious: a lie elevated by the mind to a truth.",21,RO005TR07

3853,593,"Breakfast proved to be a somber affair; I myself was utterly exhausted. I had lain awake for part of the night. Out of love? No, that was impossible; one doesn’t love the same woman twice, and I, who would love her years later, was not bound to her by anything else, apart from a passing fancy, a little filial obedience, and a great deal of silliness. And that is quite enough to explain my sleepless night; it was nothing but a fit of pique, a very minor fit, but sharp as the point of a pin, which vanished after a few cigars, a few punched pillows and books flung down unread, until, at last, dawn broke, the most tranquil of dawns.",21,RO005TR07
3854,594,"I was young, and that was remedy enough. My father found the blow far harder to take. On second thought, while that calamity may not actually have caused his death, it certainly made his final illness more complicated. He died four months later—a sad, broken man, sunk in a constant state of tension and anxiety very similar to remorse, a kind of mortal disenchantment with the world, which in his case took the usual place of coughs, colds, and rheumatism.",21,RO005TR07
3855,595,"However, he did enjoy one brief half hour of happiness, when a government minister visited him. I remember it well; I saw his face light up again with his lovely beaming smile, and there was a glimmer in his eyes which was, if I can put it like this, the final flicker of a dying soul.

Heavy mourning. Profound silence.",21,RO005TR07
3867,607,"“After all,” said Cotrim, “this house can only be worth about thirty contos, maybe thirty-five—”",21,RO005TR07
3868,608,"“It’s worth fifty,” I said. “As Sabina knows, it cost fifty-eight—”",21,RO005TR07
3869,609,"“It might well have cost sixty,” said Cotrim, “but that doesn’t mean it was actually worth that much, still less that it would be worth that much today. As you know, some years ago house prices fell drastically. Look, if this house is worth fifty contos, how much is the one you want for yourself, the one in Campo, going to be worth?”",21,RO005TR07

3873,613,"“Please, Brás, let’s not talk about these things now,” said Sabina, getting up from the sofa. “We can sort everything out very amicably and easily. For example, Cotrim doesn’t want the slaves, only Papa’s driver and Paulo—”",21,RO005TR07

3880,620,"We had discussed the silver, old family silver from colonial times, which was the biggest portion of the inheritance because of its fine workmanship, its age, and its origins; my father always used to say that the Conde da Cunha, when he was viceroy of Brazil, had given it as a gift to my great-grandfather Luís Cubas.",21,RO005TR07
3881,621,"“As for the silver,” Cotrim went on, “I wouldn’t care, but Sabina wants it, and I think she’s right. Sabina’s married and needs some decent, presentable tableware. You’re a bachelor, you don’t entertain, you—”",21,RO005TR07

Look, it would be simpler if you were to haul us up before the judge and prove, with witnesses, that Sabina is not your sister, that I’m not your brother-in-law, and that God isn’t God. Do that and you won’t lose a thing, not a single teaspoon. Let’s talk about something else, my friend.”",21,RO005TR07
3890,630,"He was clearly so very angry, as was I, that I felt I should offer some compromise: to share the silver. He laughed and asked who would have the teapot and who the sugar bowl, then declared that we would have time to settle things in court. Meanwhile, Sabina had gone over to the window that gave onto the garden, and, after a moment, she turned and proposed letting me have Paulo and another slave, on condition that she kept the silver; I was about to refuse, but Cotrim got in before me.",21,RO005TR07

I simply lived, allowing myself to be carried along on the back-and-forth of events and days, sometimes restless, sometimes apathetic, caught between ambition and despair. I wrote about politics and dabbled in literature. I sent articles and poems to journals and even acquired a certain reputation as a polemicist and poet. Whenever I thought about Lobo Neves, who was already a deputy, and about Virgília, marchioness-to-be, I asked myself why I shouldn’t make a better deputy and a better marquis than Lobo Neves; after all, I was so superior to him in every way, and I said this staring at the tip of my own nose.",21,RO005TR07

His poems found more favor and were better than mine, but he needed the approval of other people, to have his worth confirmed by the applause of others. He was a shy lad and so never asked anyone directly what they thought of his verses, and yet he delighted in hearing any appreciative word; then he would gather new energy and throw himself into his work with youthful brio.",21,RO005TR07

As soon as he had published anything, he would come straight to my house and circle around me, waiting for me to pass judgment, to offer some word or gesture that would confirm the worth of his latest publication, and instead I would talk to him about a thousand other things—about the recent ball in Catete, the debate in Parliament, about carriages and horses, about everything except his poetry or prose.",21,RO005TR07
3907,647,"He would respond in lively fashion at first, then grow increasingly lackluster, trying to turn the conversation back to his work; he would open a book, ask if I had written anything new, and I would say yes or no, then turn the conversation in another direction, and he would trot along after me, until, at last, he came to a complete halt and departed feeling sad and unsatisfied. My intention was to make him doubt himself, to discourage him, to eliminate him. And I did all this while staring at the tip of my own nose . . .",21,RO005TR07

3910,650,"O NOSE, CONSCIENCELESS CONSCIENCE, you have been of great use to me in life. Have you, dear reader, ever considered the purpose of the nose? Dr. Pangloss’s explanation was that the nose was created as a perch for our spectacles, and I confess that, until recently, this seemed to me the definitive explanation; however, there came a day when, while ruminating on this and other obscure philosophical matters, I came up with my own explanation, the one true and definitive explanation.",21,RO005TR07
3911,651,"I had only to remember what fakirs did. As the reader doubtless knows, the fakir spends long hours staring at the tip of his nose, with the aim of gaining a glimpse of heaven’s light. When he fixes his gaze on the tip of his nose, he loses all sense of external things, he luxuriates in the invisible, understands the impalpable, detaches himself from the Earth, dissolves into the ether. This sublimation of the self via the tip of the nose is the mind’s highest achievement, and the ability to achieve this state belongs not only to fakirs: it is universal.",21,RO005TR07
3912,652,"Everyone has both the need and the ability to contemplate his own nose in order to glimpse heaven’s light, and that contemplation, which, in effect, subordinates the universe to a single nose, is the basis of all social equilibrium. If noses contemplated only other noses, the human species would not last two centuries: it would have died out with the first tribes.",21,RO005TR07
3913,653,"Do I hear the reader object: “But how can that be, if no one has ever seen a man contemplating his own nose?”",21,RO005TR07
3914,654,"Obtuse reader, this only goes to show that you have never entered the mind of a hatter. A hatter walks past a hat shop belonging to a rival, who set up business two years ago; that shop had two doors then, and now it has four, and looks set to have six or eight. His rival’s hats are on display in the windows; the rival’s customers go in through the doors; the hatter compares that shop with his own, which is older and has only two doors, and compares those hats with his own less ornate ones, which nevertheless sell for the same price.",21,RO005TR07
3915,655,"Naturally, he feels mortified, but, with eyes cast down or looking straight ahead he walks on, pondering his rival’s prosperity and his own failure to thrive, when he is a far better hatter than the other man. It is at this point that he fixes his eyes on the tip of his nose.",21,RO005TR07

I only really recognized her when she came a little closer, for she looked so different, nature and art having combined to add the final finishing touch to her beauty. We greeted each other in passing, then she walked on and, along with her husband, got into the carriage that was waiting for them a little farther up the street. I was astonished.",21,RO005TR07

At another ball, held a month later—in the house of a lady who had adorned the salons of the first reign and was no less of an adornment in the salons of the second—we grew closer and for longer too, because we talked and waltzed. The waltz is a delicious thing. We waltzed; and as I pressed her magnificent, supple body to mine, I won’t deny that I experienced a very singular sensation, that of a man who has been robbed.",21,RO005TR07

Francesca and Paolo may have been undone by a book; in our case it was a waltz. I seem to recall squeezing her hand very tightly that night, and she did not withdraw it, as if she barely noticed; I had my arms around her, and everyone was looking at us and at the other dancers turning and turning, their arms about each other . . .

3940,680,"I gave no further thought to the coin that night, but when I remembered it the following day, I felt my conscience pricking me, and heard a voice asking me why the devil that coin should be mine when I had neither inherited nor earned it, but merely found it in the street. It clearly wasn’t mine, but belonged to whoever had lost it, rich or poor, possibly poor, some workman who wouldn’t be able to buy food for his wife and children, but even if the person was rich, the obligation on me was the same.",21,RO005TR07
3941,681,"I should give the coin back, and the best way, the only way, was to do so via an advertisement or through the police. I sent a letter to the chief of police, enclosing the coin, and asking him to do all he could to return it to its true owner.",21,RO005TR07
3942,682,"I sent off the letter and breakfasted in a relaxed, even, I might say, jubilant mood. My conscience had waltzed so much the previous evening that she had been left breathless and panting; but the restoration of that half doubloon opened a window onto the other side of morality; in rushed a gust of pure air, and the poor lady, my conscience, breathed more easily. Readers, always keep your consciences well ventilated! I’ll say no more. And yet, when stripped of all the surrounding circumstances, my act really was a very fine one, because it showed a real scrupulousness, the instinct of a delicate soul. This is what my inner lady, my conscience, was telling me in a voice simultaneously stern and tender; this is what she was telling me, as she leaned out of the open window.",21,RO005TR07
3943,683,"“You did the right thing, Cubas; you behaved impeccably. This air is not only pure, it’s positively balmy, it’s like a breath of air from the eternal gardens. Would you like to see what you did, Cubas?”",21,RO005TR07
3944,684,"And the good lady took out a mirror and held it up to my eyes. I saw, with absolute clarity, the half doubloon I had found the previous night, round and shining, and multiplying in numbers, first ten, then thirty, then five hundred, thus illustrating the benefits that my simple act of restoration would bring to me in life and death. And I surrendered my entire being to the contemplation of that act, seeing myself reflected in it, finding myself to be good, possibly even great. A mere coin, eh? You see what comes of having waltzed a little too much.",21,RO005TR07
3945,685,"And thus I, Brás Cubas, discovered a sublime law, the law of the equivalence of windows, and I saw that the best way to make up for closing one window is to open another, so that morality can keep your conscience continually aired.

3948,688,"AS IT HAPPENS, a few days later, on my way to Botafogo, I stumbled upon a parcel on the beach. Well, I didn’t so much stumble upon as kick it. Seeing a medium-sized parcel, neatly and correctly packaged and tied with strong twine, something that had an air about it of being “something,” I gave it a kick just to see what would happen, and when I kicked it, the parcel did not move. I glanced around me; the beach was deserted; some children were playing in the distance, while, even farther off, a fisherman was mending his nets, so there was no one who would see what I did; I bent down, picked up the parcel, and continued walking.",21,RO005TR07
3949,689,"Yes, I continued walking, but not without some trepidation. It might be a prank played by boys. I considered returning the parcel to the beach, but when I again felt its weight, I rejected the idea. A little farther on, I retraced my steps and headed home.",21,RO005TR07

3951,691,"I still hesitated for a moment, possibly out of shame; I was again assailed by the thought that this might be a prank. True, there had been no apparent witnesses, but inside me I had a little boy, who would whistle, squeal, whoop, stamp, cackle, crow, and generally cause a rumpus if he saw me open the parcel and find inside a dozen old handkerchiefs or two dozen rotten guavas. It was getting late; my curiosity was growing, as the reader’s must be too; I untied the parcel and saw . . . found . . . counted . . . and recounted neither more nor less than five contos de réis.",21,RO005TR07
3952,692,"Give or take the odd ten mil-réis. Five contos in nice new notes and coins, all neatly bundled up; a rare find. I wrapped them up again. At supper, it seemed to me that I caught one of the slave-boys looking in a knowing fashion at one of the other slaves. Could he have been watching me? I questioned him discreetly and concluded that he had not. After supper, I again went into my study to examine the money and laughed at my maternal feelings for a mere five contos, me, a wealthy man.",21,RO005TR07
3953,693,"That night, to avoid thinking any more about it, I went to Lobo Neves’s house, for he had urged me to continue to frequent his wife’s parties. Among the guests was the chief of police, to whom I was introduced. He immediately remembered the letter and the half doubloon I had sent him a few days before. Word spread; Virgília appeared to approve warmly of what I had done, and the other guests came up with similar tales of their own, to which I listened with all the impatience of a hysterical woman.",21,RO005TR07
3954,694,"Later, the next day, and for the rest of the week, I thought as little as I could about those five contos, and I have to confess that I left them sitting quietly in my desk drawer. I was happy to talk about anything except money, especially money that had been found; and yet it wasn’t a crime to find money, it was a blessing, a lucky accident, possibly an act of Providence. It couldn’t be anything else. Losing five contos isn’t the same as losing a handkerchief. You need every one of your five senses and more when you’re carrying around five contos, feeling for them in your pocket, never taking your eyes off them or your hands or your thoughts, and for someone to lose them like that, so foolishly, on a beach, must mean . . .",21,RO005TR07
3955,695,"But finding them couldn’t possibly be a crime, not a crime or a disgrace or a stain on a man’s character. It was simply a windfall, a stroke of luck, like winning the lottery or a bet on a horse or coming up trumps in some other honest game; I would almost go so far as to say that my good fortune was richly deserved, because I didn’t feel bad about it or unworthy of this gift from Providence.",21,RO005TR07
3956,696,"“Those five contos,” I told myself three weeks later, “I need to put them to good use, perhaps a dowry for some poor young girl, or something like that . . . I’ll think about it . . .”",21,RO005TR07
3957,697,"That same day, I went and deposited them at the Bank of Brazil. There they received me with many delicate allusions to the affair of the half doubloon, news of which had spread among people of my acquaintance; I replied angrily that it really didn’t merit so much fuss, but then they praised me for my modesty, and when I got annoyed at that too, they told me I was, quite simply, a very fine man.",21,RO005TR07

3961,701,"Some plants spring up and grow very quickly; others prove slow and sickly. Our love belonged in the first category; it sprouted so suddenly and was so lush that it was soon the largest, leafiest, and most exuberant thing in the woods. I couldn’t tell you exactly how long it took to grow. I do remember that, one night, the flower—or the kiss, if you prefer—bloomed, a kiss that she gave me, trembling—poor thing—trembling with fear, because we were standing at the garden gate.",21,RO005TR07
3962,702,"We were bound together by that one kiss—brief as the opportunity, ardent as our love, the prologue to a life of delights, terrors, feelings of remorse, pleasures that ended in pain, sufferings that burgeoned into joy—a patient, systematic hypocrisy, the only brake on an unstoppable passion—a life of anxieties, rages, despairs, and jealousies, which one moment repaid us superabundantly, and the next came and swallowed it all up along with everything else, and left bobbing on the surface only the anxieties and the dregs, the dregs of the dregs, which is to say: tedium and satiety: this was the book that followed said prologue.",21,RO005TR07

3965,705,"I LEFT THERE STILL SAVORING that kiss. I couldn’t sleep. I lay down in bed, but it made no difference. That night, I heard every hour strike. Normally, when I couldn’t get to sleep, I found the sound of the pendulum infuriating; that grim tick-tock, slow, dull, which seemed to be telling me with every tick that another moment of life was gone. I would imagine an old devil seated between two sacks, the sack of life and the sack of death, taking coins from life and giving them to death, and counting them thus:",21,RO005TR07

Some inventions change or die; even institutions die; but the clock is definitive and perpetual. The last man on earth, as he bids farewell to the cold, dead sun, is sure to have a watch in his pocket, so as to know the exact hour of his death.",21,RO005TR07
3971,711,"That night, I didn’t feel my usual sad sense of annoyance, but something different and delicious. I was filled by a press of fantasies crowding one upon the other, like devotees jostling each other for a better view of the cantor in a religious procession. I couldn’t hear the moments lost, only the moments gained. After a while, I heard nothing at all, because my wily, mischievous thoughts jumped out of the window and flew off to Virgília’s house. There, on her windowsill, they found Virgília’s thoughts; they greeted each other and sat chatting. And while we, possibly cold and in need of rest, lay tossing and turning in our respective beds, those idle thoughts repeated Adam and Eve’s age-old dialogue.",21,RO005TR07

3988,728,"HONESTLY! Can anyone explain what brought about that change? One day, we met, discussed marriage, decided against it, and separated, coldly, painlessly, because there was no real love between us; I felt slightly put out, but nothing more. A few years passed, I saw her again, we danced a few waltzes, and there we were, passionately in love. Virgília’s beauty had, it’s true, reached the apogee of perfection, but we were essentially the same, and I, for my part, was no handsomer, no more elegant. Can anyone explain what brought about that change?",21,RO005TR07
3989,729,"The only explanation could be that the opportune moment had now arrived. The first moment clearly wasn’t opportune, since, while neither of us was exactly unprepared for love, we were unprepared for “our” love: a fundamental distinction. Love depends on the opportuneness of the two people involved. I came up with this explanation myself two years after that kiss, one day when Virgília was complaining to me about some dandy intent on wooing her.",21,RO005TR07
3990,730,"“The importunate creature!” she said, pulling an angry face.",21,RO005TR07
3991,731,"I shuddered, and looked at her, and saw that her indignation was quite genuine; and it occurred to me that perhaps I had once provoked a similarly angry face, and then I realized how much I had evolved. I had gone from being importunate to opportune.",21,RO005TR07

3995,735,"Di pari, come buoi che vanno a giogo",21,RO005TR07
3996,736,"but I’m wrong to compare us to oxen, because we were a very different kind of beast, less lumbering, more wanton and lascivious. There we were walking along with no idea where we were going, nor along which illicit paths, a problem that worried me for a few weeks, but whose solution I placed in the hands of fate. Poor fate! I wonder what you’re up to now, you great meddler in human affairs. Perhaps you’re putting on a new skin, a different face and manner, another name, and it’s not impossible that . . .",21,RO005TR07
3997,737,"But where was I? Ah, yes, on those illicit paths. I told myself this was God’s will. It was our destiny to love each other, otherwise, how explain the waltz and all the rest? Virgília thought the same. One day, she confessed that she did sometimes experience moments of remorse, to which I responded that if she felt remorse, she clearly didn’t love me. Then Virgília put her magnificent arms about me and murmured:",21,RO005TR07
3998,738,“It’s the will of heaven that I should love you.”,21,RO005TR07
3999,739,"Her choice of the word “heaven” was no accident, because Virgília was ever so slightly religious. True, she didn’t go to mass on Sundays, and I think she only went to church on holy days or when she could get a seat in one of the private pews. But she prayed every night, fervently or at least sleepily. She was afraid of thunderstorms, and when they struck, she would cover her ears and mumble all the prayers she could remember from the catechism. In her bedroom she kept a tiny carved jacaranda altar, about twelve inches high, containing three images; not that she ever mentioned this to her women friends; on the contrary, she dubbed as fanatical even the only mildly devout. For a while I thought she felt rather ashamed to be a believer, and that her religion was a kind of flannel nightdress, protective and private, but I was obviously wrong.",21,RO005TR07

4001,741,A confidence,21,RO005TR07
4002,742,"AT FIRST I was terrified of Lobo Neves. He often told me how much he adored his wife: he thought Virgília was perfection itself, a combination of fine, solid qualities, as well as being utterly adorable, elegant, and discreet, the very model of a wife. And his trust in me did not stop there. Having opened the door just a crack, he then flung it wide. One day, he confessed to me that a sad worm was eating away at his existence: the fact that he had never received any real public acclaim.",21,RO005TR07
4003,743,"I tried to reassure him, said many flattering things, which he heard with the religious zeal of one whose desire for more will remain forever unassuaged; then I realized that his ambition had wearied of beating its wings but never taking flight. Days later, he poured out to me all his disappointments and frustrations, the resentments he had swallowed, the rages he had suppressed; he told me that political life was a web of envy, spite, intrigue, perfidy, self-interest, and vanity. He was clearly going through some kind of emotional crisis, which I did my best to counter.",21,RO005TR07
4004,744,"“I mean what I say,” he said sadly. “You can’t imagine what I’ve been through. I went into politics because I wanted to, out of family tradition, ambition, and a little vanity. In short, I was the embodiment of all the usual motives that lead any man into public life; what I lacked was self-interest. I had seen the theater from the orchestra seats, and, my, it was a fine sight! Superb scenery, life, movement, brilliant performances. I signed up, and they gave me a role that . . . But why should I weary you with all this? Leave me alone with my grumblings. I’ve already wasted hours and days thinking about it . . . There’s no constancy of feeling, no gratitude, there’s nothing . . . nothing . . . nothing . . .”",21,RO005TR07

4006,746,"“You must think me a complete fool,” he said, “and forgive me for unburdening myself like that, but something happened today that’s really been eating away at me.”",21,RO005TR07
4007,747,"And he gave a sad, mirthless laugh, then asked me not to tell anyone else what had passed between us; I commented that, strictly speaking, nothing had passed between us. Then two deputies and a local politician came into the room. Lobo Neves received them with a show of good cheer that initially rang rather false, but soon seemed perfectly natural. After half an hour, everyone would have thought him the most fortunate of men, talking, joking, and laughing, and making everyone else laugh too.",21,RO005TR07

We greeted each other affectionately, then the carriage drove on, and I continued to walk . . . and walk . . . and walk.",21,RO005TR07
4011,751,“Why shouldn’t I be a minister too?”,21,RO005TR07
4012,752,"This large, glittering idea—extravagantly dressed, as Father Bernardes would say—this idea began performing a dizzying series of somersaults at which I stared openmouthed with amazement and with amusement too. I gave not another thought to Lobo Neves’s sadness; I felt the pull of the abyss. I thought of that school friend of mine, remembered how we’d gone scrambling about in the hills, the fun we’d had and the mischief we’d got up to, and I compared the boy with the man, and asked myself why I shouldn’t be like him. I found myself then at the entrance to the Passeio Público, and everything seemed to be asking the same question:",21,RO005TR07
4013,753,"“Why shouldn’t you be a minister, Cubas? Cubas, why shouldn’t you be a minister of state?” When I heard this, a delicious, refreshing shiver ran through me. I went and sat on a bench to mull over the idea. Virgília would be equally thrilled! A few minutes later, I saw, coming toward me, a face I seemed to recognize. Yes, I knew that face from somewhere.",21,RO005TR07
4014,754,"Imagine a man aged between thirty-eight and forty, tall, thin, and pale. His clothes, apart from their cut, appeared to have escaped from the dungeons of Babylon, while his hat looked like a contemporary of Gessler’s. Now imagine a frock coat much larger than required by the wearer’s body or, rather, his bones; the black fabric was fading to a dull yellow; the nap was gradually disappearing; and of the eight original buttons only three remained. His gray cotton pants bagged at the knees, and the bottoms had been eaten away by the heel of a boot lacking either pity or polish. Around his neck fluttered the ends of a faded bicolored cravat, which kept in place a collar that hadn’t been washed in a week. I think he was also wearing a vest, a tattered, buttonless vest made of dark silk.",21,RO005TR07

It really was Quincas Borba, my witty school friend of years ago, so intelligent and so rich. Quincas Borba! No, it was impossible, it couldn’t be. I couldn’t believe that this grubby figure with a grizzled beard, this scarecrow old before his time, this ruin of a man, could be Quincas Borba. But it was. In his eyes there was still a glimmer of his old self, and his smile had not entirely lost the slightly mocking expression so peculiar to him. Meanwhile, he resolutely withstood my look of horror. Eventually I averted my eyes, for if the sight of him was repellent, any comparison with the boy I had known was deeply dispiriting.",21,RO005TR07
4019,759,"“I need hardly tell you my story,” he said at last, “you can guess for yourself. A life of penury, tribulations, and struggle. Do you remember the parades we took part in, when I always appeared as emperor or king? What a fall from grace, eh? For here I am a beggar . . .”",21,RO005TR07
4020,760,"And with a shrug and an air of indifference, he seemed resigned to the blows dealt him by fortune, possibly even contented. Possibly, but certainly unmoved. There was not a trace in him of Christian resignation or of a philosophical acceptance of his fate. It was as if penury had so callused his soul that he could no longer feel the mud clinging to it. He wore his rags as once he had worn the royal purple, with a certain indolent grace.",21,RO005TR07

I’m not asking for anything, apart from money, because I do need money in order to eat, and restaurants won’t take credit. Nor will grocers or street vendors. The wretches won’t even give me two tuppence-worth of maize flour. My life’s a hell, my . . . I almost said ‘my friend’ . . . A hell, devil take it. Indeed, may all the devils take it!

And the inevitable conclusion. From the soup onward, the sickly yellow flower of Chapter XXV began to open inside me, and so I dined quickly in order to hurry to Virgília’s house. Virgília was the present, and I wanted to take refuge in that present, to escape from the oppressions of the past, because the encounter with Quincas Borba had turned my eyes back to the past, not as it had really been, but to a broken, abject, beggarly, thieving past.",21,RO005TR07

He treats me well, there’s no doubt about that, but there’s something different about the way he looks at me. I’m not sleeping well. Just last night, I awoke terrified, dreaming he was going to kill me. Maybe I’m just imagining it, but I think he suspects something.”",21,RO005TR07
4064,804,"I reassured her as best I could, and told her they might just be political worries. Virgília agreed, but was still uneasy and anxious. We were in the drawing room overlooking the garden, the very place where we had exchanged our first kiss. The curtains were billowing gently in the breeze blowing in through the open window; I stood staring at the curtains without seeing them. I had picked up the binoculars of my imagination, and in the distance I could just make out a house of our own, a life of our own, a world of our own, in which there was no Lobo Neves, no marriage, no moral code, nor any other ties that could thwart our unfurling desires. This idea intoxicated me; once world, morality, and husband had been eliminated, we could step into that heavenly abode.",21,RO005TR07
4065,805,"“Virgília,” I said, “I have a proposition.”",21,RO005TR07
4066,806,“What?”,21,RO005TR07
4067,807,“Do you love me?”,21,RO005TR07
4068,808,"“Oh!” she sighed, flinging her arms around my neck.",21,RO005TR07
4069,809,"Virgília loved me with a passion, and her response was proof positive of that. Silent, breathless, her arms about my neck, she gazed up at me with those big beautiful eyes of hers that gave a strange impression of dewy brightness, and I gazed back into them, pressing my lips to her lips, which were as cool as dawn and as insatiable as death. There was something majestic about Virgília’s beauty now, a quality it had not possessed before her marriage.",21,RO005TR07
4070,810,"She was like one of those figures carved out of Pentelic marble, a work of free, pure, noble craftmanship, with all the tranquil beauty of a statue, but neither indifferent nor cold. On the contrary, it was clear that hers was a warm and passionate nature; indeed, it could be said that she was the embodiment of love. This was especially true on that occasion, when she expressed wordlessly everything that the human eye could say. But time was pressing; I let go of her hands, grasped her wrists, and, fixing her with my gaze, asked whether she was brave enough.",21,RO005TR07
4071,811,“To do what?”,21,RO005TR07
4072,812,"“To run away. We’ll go wherever suits us best; a big house or a little house, it’s up to you, in the country or the city, or in Europe, wherever you want, where no one will bother us and where you’ll be in no danger, where we can live solely for each other . . . What do you say? Shall we? Sooner or later he’ll find out, and you’ll be ruined, you know. Ruined . . . dead . . . and he’ll be dead too, because I swear to you, I will kill him.”",21,RO005TR07
4073,813,"I stopped. Virgília had turned very pale, then she let her arms fall by her side and sat down on the sofa. She sat there for several moments without saying a word; I don’t know whether she was hesitating or merely terrified at the idea of discovery and death. I joined her on the sofa, repeated my proposal, and spoke of all the advantages of a life together, just the two of us, without jealousy, or fear, or worries. Virgília listened to me in silence, then said:",21,RO005TR07
4074,814,“We might not escape. He might come and find me and kill me just the same.”,21,RO005TR07
4075,815,"I assured her he wouldn’t. The world was vast enough, and I had the means to live wherever the sun shone and the air was pure. He would never find us, for only great passions are capable of great actions, and he did not love her enough to go looking for her if she was far enough away. Virgília looked surprised and almost indignant, and murmured that her husband was very fond of her.",21,RO005TR07
4076,816,"“That may well be,” I replied. “That may well be . . .”",21,RO005TR07
4077,817,"I went over to the window and began drumming my fingers on the windowsill. Virgília called to me, but I stayed where I was, brooding on my jealousy, thinking I would willingly strangle her husband were he within reach . . . Then, at that precise moment, Lobo Neves appeared in the garden below. Do not tremble or blanch so, madam reader. Rest assured I will not sully this page with a drop of blood. The moment he appeared, I gave him a friendly wave and a kindly word. Virgília hurriedly left the room, which he entered just three minutes later.",21,RO005TR07
4078,818,“Have you been here long?” he asked.,21,RO005TR07
4079,819,“No.”,21,RO005TR07
4080,820,"He was in a serious mood, weighed down by something, his eyes darting around distractedly—a habit of his, but one he immediately exchanged for a look of genuine good cheer on seeing his son Nhonhô, the future law graduate of Chapter VI, come into the room. He took him in his arms, lifted him in the air, and kissed him many times. I disliked the boy intensely, and so kept my distance from them both. Then Virgília returned.",21,RO005TR07
4081,821,"“Ah!” sighed Lobo Neves, slumping wearily onto the sofa.",21,RO005TR07
4082,822,“Tired?” I asked.,21,RO005TR07
4083,823,"“Very. I’ve just endured two boring encounters of the very first order, one in the Chamber of Deputies and another out in the street. And there’s a third one to come,” he added, looking at his wife.",21,RO005TR07
4084,824,“What’s that?” asked Virgília.,21,RO005TR07
4085,825,"“Go on, guess!”",21,RO005TR07
4086,826,"Virgília, sitting beside him now, took one of his hands, straightened his tie, and asked again what it was.",21,RO005TR07
4087,827,"“A box at the opera, no less.”",21,RO005TR07

4089,829,“To hear Candiani.”,21,RO005TR07
4090,830,"Virgília clapped her hands, stood up, and kissed her son with an air of childish delight quite at odds with her appearance. Then she asked if the box was in the center or in the slips, and consulted with her husband in a low voice as to what she should wear, which opera was being sung, and goodness knows what else.",21,RO005TR07
4091,831,"“You’ll stay for supper, sir,” Lobo Neves said.",21,RO005TR07
4092,832,"“He came for that very reason,” confirmed his wife. “He says you have the best wine in Rio de Janeiro.”",21,RO005TR07
4093,833,"“Even so, he never drinks much.”",21,RO005TR07
4094,834,"At supper, I proved him wrong and drank more than usual, but less than I needed in order to succumb to madness. I was already quite agitated enough and became a little more so. It was the first time I’d felt truly angry at Virgília. I didn’t look at her once during the entire meal. I talked about politics, the press, the government, and I imagine I would have talked about theology had I known or remembered any. Lobo Neves listened in a very placid, dignified manner, even with a certain condescending benevolence, all of which only added to my irritation and made the supper seem an even longer and more awkward affair. I said good night as soon as we rose from the table.",21,RO005TR07
4095,835,"“See you later, then?” asked Lobo Neves.",21,RO005TR07

4099,839,The transaction,21,RO005TR07
4100,840,"I WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS and reached home at nine o’clock. Unable to sleep, I threw myself into reading and writing. By eleven o’clock I regretted not having gone to the theater; I looked at the clock, and considered getting dressed and going out. I decided, however, that I would arrive too late; what’s more, it would be a sign of weakness. Virgília was clearly beginning to grow tired of me, I thought. This idea filled me with successive waves of despair and indifference, alternating between a desire to kill her and to forget all about her.",21,RO005TR07
4101,841,"I could see her there, leaning back in her opera box, with her magnificently bared arms—those arms that were mine, only mine—seducing the eyes of all before her with the superb gown she must surely be wearing, her milky-white décolleté, her hair parted down the middle according to the fashion of the time, and her diamonds, which sparkled less brightly than her eyes . . . That was how I envisaged her, and it pained me that others would see her like that too. Then I began to undress her, setting her jewels and silks to one side, unpinning her hair with my greedy, lascivious hands, making her—I don’t know whether more beautiful or more natural—making her mine, all mine, only mine.",21,RO005TR07
4102,842,"The following day, I could bear it no longer. I went to Virgília’s house early and found her with her eyes red from crying.",21,RO005TR07
4103,843,“What’s wrong?” I asked.,21,RO005TR07
4104,844,"“You don’t love me,” she answered. “You’ve never loved me in the slightest. Yesterday you treated me as if you hated me. If I at least knew what I’d done! But I don’t. Won’t you tell me what it was?”",21,RO005TR07
4105,845,“What what was? I don’t think there was anything.”,21,RO005TR07
4106,846,“Nothing? You treated me like a dog . . .”,21,RO005TR07
4107,847,"At that word I grasped her hands, kissed them, and tears welled up in her eyes.",21,RO005TR07
4108,848,"“Hush, hush,” I said.",21,RO005TR07
4109,849,"I didn’t have the heart to reproach her, and besides, what could I reproach her with? It wasn’t her fault if her husband loved her. I told her that she had done me no wrong, that, naturally enough, I was jealous of her husband, and that I didn’t always find his company easy to endure. I added that he might well have his suspicions, and that the best means of closing the door on fears and quarrels was to accept the plan I had put to her the previous day.",21,RO005TR07
4110,850,"“Yes, I’ve been thinking about that,” replied Virgília. “A little house all of our own, by itself, with a garden, tucked away on some backstreet—isn’t that it? I like the idea, but why do we need to run away?”",21,RO005TR07
4111,851,"She said this in the languid, guileless tone of someone with not an evil thought in her head, and the smile that lifted the corners of her mouth bore the same candid expression. Pulling away from her, I replied:",21,RO005TR07
4112,852,“You’re the one who has never loved me.”,21,RO005TR07
4113,853,“Me?”,21,RO005TR07
4114,854,"“Yes, you’re a complete egotist! You’d rather see me suffer every day . . . You’re an unspeakable egotist!”",21,RO005TR07
4115,855,"Virgília burst into tears, and, fearing that someone might hear, she stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth to silence her sobs. This outburst unsettled me. If anyone in the house heard her, all would be lost. I leaned toward her, held her tightly by the wrists, and whispered all the sweet names I had called her in our most intimate moments; I pointed out the danger, and fear helped calm her.",21,RO005TR07
4116,856,"“I can’t,” she said after a few moments. “I can’t leave my son. If I take him with me, I know that Damião would go to the ends of the earth to find me. I can’t. Kill me, if you like, or leave me to die . . . Oh, God! Oh, God!”",21,RO005TR07
4117,857,“Calm down. Someone might hear you.”,21,RO005TR07
4118,858,"“Well, let them hear! What do I care!”",21,RO005TR07
4119,859,"She was still very overwrought; I begged her to forget what I had said, to forgive me. I told her I was a madman, but that my madness began with her, and would end with her. Virgília dried her eyes and reached out her hand. We both smiled. A few minutes later, we returned to the subject of the secluded house tucked away on some backstreet . . .",21,RO005TR07

4121,861,Eyes and ears,21,RO005TR07
4122,862,WE WERE INTERRUPTED by the sound of a carriage outside. A slave came to say that it was Baroness X. Virgília shot me a questioning glance.,21,RO005TR07
4123,863,"“Since you have such a headache, madam,” I said, “it might be better not to receive her.”",21,RO005TR07
4124,864,“Has she already got out of her carriage?” Virgília asked the slave.,21,RO005TR07
4125,865,"“She has. She says she needs to speak to you urgently, Missy!”",21,RO005TR07
4126,866,“Then show her in.”,21,RO005TR07
4127,867,"The baroness entered shortly afterward. I don’t know if she was expecting me to be there, but she could hardly have been more effusive.",21,RO005TR07
4128,868,"“What a sight for sore eyes!” she exclaimed. “Where have you been hiding? You’re never to be seen anywhere these days! Why, I was very surprised not to see you at the theater last night. Candiani was delightful. What a woman! Do you like Candiani? Of course you do. Men are all the same. Last night in our box, the baron said to me that one Italian woman is worth five Brazilians. Such impertinence! And the impertinence of an old man, which is even worse. But tell me, why didn’t you go to the theater yesterday?”",21,RO005TR07
4129,869,“I had a migraine.”,21,RO005TR07
4130,870,"“Nonsense! Some love affair, don’t you think, Virgília? Well, my friend, you ought to get a move on, because you must be getting on for forty . . . Or are you forty already?”",21,RO005TR07
4131,871,"“I couldn’t tell you with any certainty,” I replied, “but with your permission, I will go and check my baptism certificate.”",21,RO005TR07
4132,872,"“Go, go . . .” And, offering me her hand, she added: “When shall we see you next? We’ll be ‘at home’ on Saturday. The baron’s been missing you . . .”",21,RO005TR07
4133,873,"When I reached the street, I regretted having left. The baroness was one of the people who was most suspicious about us. She was fifty-five years old, but looked more like forty, pleasant and kind, still with the vestiges of her past beauty, an elegant bearing and refined manners. She didn’t usually speak much, having the great art of listening to others while observing them closely. At such times she would lean back in her chair, unsheathe a long, sharp look, and simply wait.",21,RO005TR07
4134,874,"The others, not realizing what was going on, would talk, exchange glances, and gesticulate, while she merely watched, with her eyes sometimes fixed, sometimes roving, even taking her ruse so far as to appear to be gazing inward, letting her eyelids droop. However, using her eyelashes as lattices, her gaze would continue its work, rummaging around in the souls and lives of others.",21,RO005TR07
4135,875,"The second such person was a relative of Virgília’s called Viegas, a worthless old wreck of seventy winters gone, shriveled and sallow, and who suffered from persistent rheumatism, equally persistent asthma, and a heart condition; he was a walking hospital. His eyes, however, were brimming with life and health. During the first few weeks, Virgília thought him perfectly harmless; she would tell me that when Viegas appeared to be looking at us with a fixed stare, he was simply counting money in his head. He was indeed a terrible miser.",21,RO005TR07
4136,876,"There was also Virgília’s cousin, Luís Dutra, who I was now seeking to disarm by talking to him about his poetry and prose, and introducing him to my acquaintances. When these acquaintances, on connecting the name to the person, said how pleased they were to meet him, Luís Dutra was beside himself with happiness. I assuaged the pain I felt on seeing his happiness with the hope that he would never give us away. Finally, there were certain ladies, several dandies, and the household staff, who, naturally enough, were eager to avenge their servile status. Altogether, they formed a veritable forest of eyes and ears, among whom we were obliged to slip and slide with the skill and suppleness of snakes.",21,RO005TR07

4138,878,Legs,21,RO005TR07
4139,879,"NOW, WHILE I WAS THINKING about all these people, my legs were carrying me down through the streets until, without even realizing it, I found myself at the door of the Hotel Pharoux, where I was in the habit of dining; however, not having walked there deliberately, the merit of such action belongs not to me but to my legs, which had brought me to my destination. Well done, legs! And to think that some people treat you with disdain or indifference. Until then, I myself had held you in low esteem; I would get cross when you grew tired, or when you could not go beyond a certain point, leaving me flapping my wings like a hen tied by the feet.",21,RO005TR07
4140,880,"This particular incident, however, was a real moment of illumination. Yes, dear legs, you left the task of fretting about Virgília to my head, and said to each other: “He needs to eat. It’s dinnertime. Let’s take him to the Hotel Pharoux. We’ll divide his consciousness in two: one part can stay focused on the lady while we take charge of the other part, making sure he walks straight, doesn’t bump into passersby or carriages, tips his hat to acquaintances, and arrives safe and sound at the hotel.” And you carried out your plan to the letter, dear legs, which obliges me to immortalize you on this page.",21,RO005TR07

4142,882,The little house,21,RO005TR07
4143,883,"I DINED AND RETURNED HOME. There I found a box of cigars that Lobo Neves had sent me, wrapped in tissue paper and tied with pink ribbons. I understood at once, opened it, and pulled out this note:",21,RO005TR07

4145,885,We’ve been found out. All is lost. Forget me. We can never see each other again. Adieu. Forget your poor unhappy,21,RO005TR07
4146,886,V . . . a,21,RO005TR07
4147,887,"The letter was indeed a blow. Nevertheless, as soon as night fell, I rushed to Virgília’s house. I was just in time; she had changed her mind. At the window, she told me what had happened with the baroness. The baroness had told her frankly that there had been much talk at the theater the previous night concerning my absence from Lobo Neves’s box, as well as comments about my relationship with the household. In short, we were the object of public suspicion. Virgília said she didn’t know what to do.",21,RO005TR07
4148,888,"“The best thing is for us to run away,” I suggested.",21,RO005TR07
4149,889,"“Never,” she replied, shaking her head.",21,RO005TR07
4150,890,"I saw it was impossible to separate two things which in her mind were irrevocably connected: our love and public opinion. Virgília was capable of making equally great sacrifices to preserve both of these benefits, but running away would leave her with only one. Perhaps I felt something akin to resentment, but there had already been so many emotions during those two days, and my resentment quickly waned. Let’s do it, let’s find ourselves a nice little house.",21,RO005TR07
4151,891,"A few days later, I found one that was almost made for us, tucked away in a corner of Gamboa. A little gem! Brand-new and freshly painted, with four windows at the front and two on either side, brick-colored shutters, walls clad in climbing vines, and a front garden; mystery and seclusion. A gem!",21,RO005TR07
4152,892,"We agreed that it would be occupied by a woman Virgília knew, who had once worked for her as a seamstress and lady’s companion. The woman was utterly besotted with Virgília. We wouldn’t tell her everything; she would easily come around.",21,RO005TR07
4153,893,"For me this signaled a new phase of our love: the illusion of exclusive possession, of absolute dominion, something that would soothe my conscience and preserve decorum. I was tired of Lobo Neves’s curtains, his chairs, his carpet, his sofa, and all those objects that constantly reminded me of our duplicity. Now I could avoid those endless suppers, the ritual of tea every evening, even the presence of their son, my accomplice and enemy.",21,RO005TR07
4154,894,"The little house spared me all of that; the vulgar world would end at its door, and from there on in lay infinity, a world that was eternal, superior, exceptional, ours and only ours, with no laws, no institutions, no baronesses, no eyes, and no ears—just one world, one couple, one life, one purpose, one affection—the moral unity of all things through the exclusion of those that opposed me.",21,RO005TR07

4157,897,"SUCH WERE MY THOUGHTS as I passed through Valongo on my way back from viewing and arranging to rent the house. They were interrupted by a crowd that had gathered to watch one black man whipping another in the square. The other black man did not dare to escape; he merely groaned: “Please, sir. I’m sorry, sir!” But the first black man paid no attention, and replied to each entreaty with a further lashing.",21,RO005TR07

4161,901,"I stopped to watch . . . Good heavens! Who did I see wielding the lash? None other than my own slave-boy Prudêncio, whom my father had freed a couple of years earlier.

I carried on, mulling over an infinite number of thoughts which, I regret to say, are now entirely forgotten; they would have provided ample material for a good chapter, and perhaps a cheerful one at that. I like cheerful chapters; they are my great weakness. Viewed from the outside, the incident at Valongo was ghastly, but only from the outside. As soon as I probed further with the knife of reason, I found within it a kernel that was amusing, discerning, and even profound. It was Prudêncio’s way of ridding himself of all the beatings he had received, by passing them on to someone else.",21,RO005TR07
4168,908,"As a child, I had ridden on his back, put a bridle between his teeth, and thrashed him mercilessly; he could do nothing but groan and suffer. Now that he was a free man, in full possession of himself, his arms, and his legs, he could work, rest, or sleep unfettered by his former condition, and now he was turning the tables; he had bought a slave and was paying him, with hefty interest, for all that he had received from me.

4173,913,"Poor Romualdo! People laughed at his explanation, but the reader probably isn’t laughing, and with good reason. I don’t find it at all funny.

4179,919,"It wasn’t easy for her to accept the house; she sensed our true intentions and disliked her new role, but she finally gave in. I think she wept at the beginning out of sheer self-disgust. She certainly didn’t look me in the face for the first two months; she would speak to me with eyes lowered, her face grave and sullen, at times sad. I wanted to win her over and so never behaved as if I were offended, but treated her with kindness and respect, working hard to earn her goodwill, and then her trust.",21,RO005TR07
4180,920,"Once she trusted me, I made up a pathetic story of my great love affair with Virgília before her marriage, adding in her father’s resistance, her husband’s brutality, and goodness knows what other novelistic touches. Dona Plácida rejected not a single page of that novel, but accepted them all. Her conscience needed to. After six months, anyone who saw the three of us together would have said that Dona Plácida was my mother-in-law.",21,RO005TR07
4181,921,"I was not ungrateful; I set her up with five contos—the same five contos I had found in Botafogo—as a nest egg for her old age. Dona Plácida thanked me with tears in her eyes, and from then on never ceased to pray for me, every night, before an image of the Virgin she kept in her room. And that put paid to any feelings of disgust.",21,RO005TR07

4183,923,The problem with this book,21,RO005TR07
4184,924,"I’M BEGINNING TO REGRET writing this book. Not that I’m tired of it; I have nothing else to do, and indeed sending a few meager chapters out into that other world of yours is a task that gives me some distraction from eternity. But the book is tedious and has a whiff of the grave about it, a certain rigor mortis, which is a serious defect and yet a trifling one too, because the main problem with this book is you, the reader. You’re in a hurry to get old, and the book progresses slowly; you love direct, sustained narrative, a regular, fluid style, whereas this book and my style are like a pair of drunkards: they stagger left and right, start and stop, mumble, yell, roar with laughter, shake their fists at the heavens, then stumble and fall . . .",21,RO005TR07
4185,925,"And fall! Miserable leaves of my graveyard cypress, you, too, will fall, just like other showier, more beautiful leaves; if I still had eyes, I would shed a tear of remembrance for you. This is the great advantage of death: while it leaves no mouth to laugh with, it leaves no eyes to weep with either. You, too, will fall.",21,RO005TR07

4188,928,"PERHAPS I’LL LEAVE OUT the preceding chapter. Among other reasons, there is a sentence in the last few lines that comes very close to being sheer nonsense, and I don’t want to give fodder to my future critics.",21,RO005TR07
4189,929,"Just imagine: seventy years from now, a thin, sallow, gray-haired fellow, who loves only books, sits hunched over the preceding page to see if he can spot that nonsense. He reads, rereads, then reads again, unpicks the words, pulls out one syllable, then another, and another, and all the others, examines them inside and out, from every angle, holds them up to the light, dusts them off, rubs them on his knee, wipes them with a wet cloth, and all in vain; he cannot find the nonsense.",21,RO005TR07
4190,930,"He is a bibliomaniac. He doesn’t know the author; the name “Brás Cubas” doesn’t appear in his biographical dictionaries. He found the volume by chance in a run-down secondhand bookstore. He bought it for a mere pittance: two hundred réis. He inquired, investigated, hunted around, and came to the conclusion that it was the only copy. The only one! Those of you who do not just love books, but have a positive mania for them, will know very well the value of that word “only,” and you can therefore imagine my bibliomaniac’s delight. He would refuse the throne of India, the papacy, and all the museums in Italy and Holland, if he had to give up this one copy; and not because it was my Memoirs; he would do the same even if it were a copy of Laemmert’s Almanac, as long as it was the only one.",21,RO005TR07
4191,931,"The bothersome bit is the nonsense. There he is, hunched over the page, with a monocle in his right eye, entirely devoted to the noble but grueling task of pinpointing the nonsense. He has already promised himself that he will write a brief account in which he will describe his discovery of the book and its sublime ridiculousness, if there is such a thing lurking beneath that obscure sentence. In the end, he finds nothing and contents himself with owning the book. He closes it, gazes at it once, twice, then goes to the window and holds it up to the sunlight. The only copy! At this very moment, a Caesar or a Cromwell passes beneath his window, on the road to power. Our man turns his back, closes the window, stretches out in his hammock, and leafs slowly through the book, sip by loving sip . . . The only copy!",21,RO005TR07

4194,934,"THAT BIT OF NONSENSE has made me waste yet another chapter. How much better it would have been to tell things plainly, without all these jolts! I have already compared my style to a drunkard’s gait. If the idea seems indecorous to you, I will say that it is a style suited to my repasts with Virgília in the little house in Gamboa, where at times we held our feasts, our afternoon teas. Wine, fruit, jam. We did indeed eat, but it was a meal punctuated with sweet nothings, tender gazes, childish whims, and an infinite number of heartfelt asides; in other words, the true and uninterrupted discourse of love.",21,RO005TR07
4195,935,"Sometimes a little quarrel would erupt to temper the cloying sweetness of the situation. Virgília would storm off, taking refuge at one end of the sofa, or in the kitchen listening to Dona Plácida’s platitudes. Five or ten minutes later, we would resume our conversation, just as I resume my narrative, merely to pause it once again. It should be noted that, far from rejecting prudence, it was our practice to invite it, in the person of Dona Plácida, to sit with us at our table; but Dona Plácida never accepted.",21,RO005TR07

4200,940,Dona Plácida’s story,21,RO005TR07
4201,941,"ONE SHOULD NEVER FEEL BAD about being generous; the silver coin earned me a secret from Dona Plácida and, consequently, this chapter. Finding her alone in the house a few days later, I struck up a conversation, and she told me her story in the briefest of terms. She was the illegitimate daughter of a cathedral sacristan and a woman who sold homemade cakes and pastries. She lost her father when she was ten years old. By then she was already grating coconut for culinary purposes and performing whatever other tasks were compatible with her age.",21,RO005TR07
4202,942,"At fifteen or sixteen she married a tailor, who died of consumption soon after, leaving her with a daughter. Widowed and little more than a girl herself, she was left to care for her two-year-old daughter and her mother, who, by then, was worn out with hard work. Three mouths to feed. She baked cakes and pastries, as was her trade, but she also sewed assiduously, day and night, for three or four dress shops, as well as teaching some children from the neighborhood for ten tostões a month. And so the years passed, but not her beauty, because she’d never had any. There were a couple of courtships, propositions, seductions even, all of which she resisted.",21,RO005TR07
4203,943,"“If I could have found another husband,” she told me, “believe me, I would have remarried. But no one wanted to marry me.”",21,RO005TR07
4204,944,"One of her suitors managed to get in her good books, but when he proved just as unscrupulous as the others, Dona Plácida soon sent him packing, but after doing so, she wept bitterly. She carried on with her sewing and her pastries. Her mother was cantankerous by virtue of her temperament, her age, and her poverty, and nagged her daughter to accept one of the borrowed or occasional husbands who sought her favors.",21,RO005TR07
4205,945,"“Do you think you’re better than me?” she would holler. “I don’t know where you get these highfalutin notions of yours. Life doesn’t sort things out all by itself, my friend; you can’t live on thin air. Just take a look at yourself! Nice young men like that Policarpo down at the store, poor thing . . . Are you waiting for some knight in shining armor? Is that it?”",21,RO005TR07
4206,946,"Dona Plácida assured me that she had not been waiting for some knight in shining armor. It was just the way she was: she wanted to be married. She knew very well that her mother hadn’t been married, and she knew some women who only had their “young man,” but it was simply the way she was, and she wanted to be married. She also wanted nothing less for her own daughter. She worked hard, burning her fingers on the stove and her eyes on the light from the candles, just to make ends meet. She became thin, then ill, then lost her mother, buried her by public subscription, and carried on working. By then her daughter was fourteen, but very indolent, and she did nothing but flirt with the ne’er-do-wells who hung around outside her window. Dona Plácida was very careful indeed, taking her daughter with her whenever she had to go and deliver her sewing. The people in the dress shops winked or scowled, convinced that she had brought her daughter along in order to catch a husband for her, or something else. Some joked and paid her little compliments; some even offered her money . . .",21,RO005TR07
4207,947,"Dona Plácida paused for a moment, then went on:",21,RO005TR07
4208,948,"“My daughter ran away. She ran off with some man or other; I don’t even want to know who. She left me all alone, and I was so sad I thought I’d die. I had no one else in the world and I was getting old and sick. It was around that time that I met Missy’s family, good people who gave me work and even a place to live. I stayed several months, then a year and more, as a servant, sewing. I left when Missy got married. After that, I lived at God’s mercy. Look at my fingers, look at these hands . . .” She showed me her rough, cracked hands, her pinpricked fingertips. “This didn’t happen by chance, sir, but the Lord above knows how it happened. Luckily, Missy came to my rescue, and you too, sir. I was afraid I’d end up begging in the street . . .”",21,RO005TR07
4209,949,"As she said this, Dona Plácida shuddered. Then, as if regaining her composure, it seemed to dawn on her that this was perhaps an unfortunate confession to make to the lover of a married woman. She began to laugh, and took back her words, calling herself a silly fool, “full of highfalutin notions,” as her mother used to say. Finally, when I still said nothing, she left the room. I stayed there staring at the tips of my boots.",21,RO005TR07

4213,953,"“So one day, the cathedral sacristan, while serving at mass, saw entering the church the lady who was to be his collaborator in the life of Dona Plácida. He saw her on subsequent days, for weeks on end; he liked her, complimented her, trod on her foot while lighting the candles on the altars on holy days. She liked him too, they became close, and fell in love. From such a conjuncture of idle passions sprang Dona Plácida. One assumes that Dona Plácida could not yet speak when she was born, but if she could, she might well have said to the authors of her days:",21,RO005TR07
4214,954,"‘Here I am. Why did you call me?’ And the sacristan and his good lady would naturally have answered: ‘We called you so that you could burn your fingers on the stove, ruin your eyes with sewing by candlelight, eat badly or not at all, trudge back and forth, cooking and cleaning, getting sick and then better, only to get sick again and better again, sometimes sad, sometimes desperate, at others resigned, but always with a cooking pot in your hand and your eyes on your needlework, until one day you end up in the gutter or in hospital. That’s why we called you, in a moment of kindness.’ ”",21,RO005TR07

4216,956,Manure,21,RO005TR07
4217,957,"SUDDENLY MY CONSCIENCE gave me a twinge, accusing me of having forced Dona Plácida’s moral probity to capitulate, subjecting her to a shameful role after a long life of toil and hardship. A go-between was no better than a concubine, and yet I had made her stoop to that profession, in return for money and small favors. That is what my conscience told me, and for some ten minutes I didn’t know what to reply. My conscience added that I had exploited the former seamstress’s devotion to Virgília, as well as her gratitude, and, indeed, her poverty. It noted Dona Plácida’s resistance, her tears during the early days, her long face, her silences, her lowered eyes, and my own skill in playing along with this until I eventually won her over. And it prodded me once again, this time angry and annoyed.",21,RO005TR07
4218,958,"I agreed that this was indeed true, but said in my defense that Dona Plácida would at least be spared from begging in her old age, which was some compensation. If it hadn’t been for my love affair, Dona Plácida would probably end up like so many other human creatures, from which it can be deduced that vice is often the manure of virtue, which does not prevent virtue from being a pure and fragrant flower. My conscience agreed, and I went to open the door to Virgília.",21,RO005TR07

4221,961,"VIRGÍLIA CAME IN LOOKING BREEZY and relaxed. Time had borne away her fears and anxieties. Ah, but how sweet it had been, back in the early days, to watch her arrive trembling and ashamed! She would arrive in a closed carriage, her face veiled and her shapely figure swathed in an all-concealing hooded cape. On the first occasion, she had slumped flushed and breathless onto the sofa, staring at the floor, and, my word, never had I found her so beautiful, perhaps because I had never felt more flattered.",21,RO005TR07
4222,962,"Now, however, as I was saying, her fears and anxieties were over; our trysts had entered a regular, chronometric phase. The intensity of our love was the same; the difference being that the flame no longer burned as fiercely as it had in those early days, and had become a simple beam of light, calm and constant, as happens in marriage.",21,RO005TR07
4223,963,"“I’m very angry with you,” she said as she sat down.",21,RO005TR07
4224,964,“Why?”,21,RO005TR07
4225,965,"“Because you didn’t come yesterday, as you said you would. Damião asked several times whether you would not at least be coming for tea. Why didn’t you come?”",21,RO005TR07
4226,966,"I had indeed failed to keep my word, and it was all Virgília’s fault. A matter of jealousy. This splendid woman knew the cause, and liked to hear me say it, whether aloud or in whispers. Two days earlier, at the baroness’s, she had waltzed twice with the same young dandy, after listening to his gallant overtures in a corner by the window. She was so happy! So effusive! So full of herself! When she spotted a quizzical, menacing frown line appear between my eyebrows, she showed no surprise, nor did she become suddenly serious, but simply abandoned the dandy and his overtures. She came toward me, took me by the arm, and led me into the other room where there were fewer people; there she complained of feeling tired and said many other things in the childish tone she was in the habit of adopting on certain occasions, and I listened to her in near-silence.",21,RO005TR07
4227,967,"Now, in Dona Plácida’s house, it was once again difficult for me to say anything in reply, but finally I told Virgília the reason for my absence. Never indeed, O eternal stars, have I seen eyes more startled. Her mouth half open, her eyebrows arched, a look of visible, tangible, undeniable astonishment—such was Virgília’s initial response. She then shook her head with a tender, pitying smile that completely confounded me.",21,RO005TR07
4228,968,"“Oh, you silly thing!”",21,RO005TR07
4229,969,"And she went to take off her hat, as blithe and sprightly as a schoolgirl just home from school.

Several moments of silence ensued; we could hear only the barking of a dog, and, I think, the sound of waves breaking on the shore. When she still did not speak, I looked at her hard. She was staring down at the floor, her eyes dull, her hands resting on her knees, her fingers interlaced, in an attitude of utter despair.",21,RO005TR07

I wavered between wanting and not wanting, between the compassion that was drawing me back to Virgília’s house and another sentiment—selfishness, let’s say—which was telling me: “Stay, leave her alone with the problem, leave her alone and she will come down on the side of love.” I believe those two impulses were equally strong, both of them attacking and resisting simultaneously, with passion and tenacity, and neither of them yielding definitively.",21,RO005TR07
4255,995,"At times, I felt a tiny twinge of remorse; it seemed to me that I was abusing the weakness of a woman caught up in a guiltily adulterous affair, without having to sacrifice or risk anything myself. Then, just as I was about to capitulate, love would once again return, repeating its selfish advice, and I would remain restless and indecisive, wanting to see her, yet fearful that seeing her would force me to share responsibility for the solution.",21,RO005TR07
4256,996,"Finally, I found a compromise between selfishness and compassion: I would go to visit her, but only in her own house, in her husband’s presence, not in order to say anything to her, but simply to wait and see the effect of my words. In this way I could reconcile the two impulses. Now, as I write this, it seems to me that this compromise was a sham, that my compassion was just another form of selfishness, and that the decision to go and comfort Virgília was prompted only by my own suffering.",21,RO005TR07

I could swear she felt some slight consolation when our eyes met, eyes filled with curiosity and tenderness. Lobo Neves told me his plans for the governorship, the local difficulties, his hopes, his resolutions. He was so happy! So optimistic! Virgília, at the other end of the table, was pretending to read a book, but she glanced up at me from time to time, eager and questioning.",21,RO005TR07

Not even a hint of one: his gaze was sincere and direct, and the placid expression on his face was natural and unforced, almost jaunty. I took a deep breath, but couldn’t bring myself to look at Virgília; I could feel her eyes peering at me over the page, asking the same question, and I replied, yes, I would go.

I wondered whether this plan might not have an unseemly effect on Virgília’s reputation, and whether there might not be some other, more reasonable means of combining Government with Gamboa. I found none. As I got out of bed the next morning, I was resolved to accept the position. At midday, my servant came and told me that a lady was in the drawing room, wearing a veil. I hurried in; it was my sister Sabina.",21,RO005TR07

We gazed at each other, our hands clasped, talking of everything and nothing, like two lovers. It was my childhood rushing back to me, fresh, mischievous, and golden; the years fell away like the dog-eared cards I used to play with as a child, flinging them down on the floor one by one, and once again I could see our old house, our family, our celebrations. I held out against being too moved by those memories, but just then a barber nearby started droning away on his old fiddle, and that voice—because until then the memories had been silent—that voice from the past, nasal and mournful, moved me so much that . . .",21,RO005TR07
4279,1019,"Sabina’s eyes, however, were dry, for she had not inherited that sickly yellow flower. What of it? She was my sister, my own blood, part of my mother, and I told her so, tenderly and sincerely . . . Suddenly I heard a knock at the door. I went to open it. In the hallway stood a little angel of five years old.",21,RO005TR07
4280,1020,"“Come in, Sara,” said Sabina.",21,RO005TR07
4281,1021,"It was my niece. I picked her up and kissed her many times. The little girl was frightened and pushed against me with her tiny hands, twisting and turning to get away. At this point, a hat appeared in the doorway, and then a man. It was Cotrim, none other than Cotrim himself. I was so moved that I released the little girl and threw myself into the arms of her father. He may have found such effusive behavior disconcerting; he certainly seemed a little embarrassed. This didn’t last long, though, and in no time at all we were chatting away like old friends.",21,RO005TR07
4282,1022,"No allusions to the past, many plans for the future, and promises to dine at each other’s houses. I was careful to mention that this exchange of suppers might be subject to a brief interruption, because I was thinking of traveling up north. Sabina looked at Cotrim, and Cotrim looked at Sabina; both agreed that the idea made no sense at all. What the devil was I going to find up north?",21,RO005TR07
4283,1023,"Surely it was in the capital, right here in the capital, that I should continue to shine, putting all those young whippersnappers in the shade? For, indeed, not one of them could compare to me. He, Cotrim, had been following my progress from a distance, and, despite our silly quarrel, he had always taken an interest, and even felt a certain rush of pride when he learned of my triumphs. He heard what was being said about me in the streets and salons: it was a symphony of praise and admiration. So why leave all this behind to go and spend a few months in the provinces, unnecessarily, for no real reason? Unless, of course, it was politics . . .",21,RO005TR07
4284,1024,"“Precisely. Politics,” I said.",21,RO005TR07

4286,1026,"“With pleasure, but tomorrow or the day after, you must dine with me.”",21,RO005TR07

4291,1031,"NO MATTER WHAT MELANCHOLICS may tell you, life is a sweet thing. That is what I thought to myself as I watched Sabina, her husband, and their daughter clatter down the stairs, their warm words rising up behind them to where I stood on the landing, directing my own warm words down to them. I continued to tell myself how very fortunate I was. A woman loved me, her husband trusted me, I was to be secretary to them both, and I was reconciled with my own flesh and blood. What more could I ask for, and all in the space of twenty-four hours?",21,RO005TR07
4292,1032,"That same day, trying to prepare public perceptions, I began to spread the news that I might go up north to work as secretary to a provincial governor, in order to further certain political designs known only to me. I said this in Rua do Ouvidor, and repeated it the following day at the Hotel Pharoux and at the theater. There were already rumors going around about Lobo Neves’s possible appointment, and some individuals, linking my appointment to that of Lobo Neves, smiled mischievously, while others patted me on the back. At the theater, a lady told me I was taking my love of sculpture much too far. She was referring to Virgília’s shapely form.",21,RO005TR07
4293,1033,"But the most blatant allusion was made by a guest at Sabina’s house, three days later. The person who made it was an old surgeon by the name of Garcez, a tiny, trivial, talkative man who could well reach seventy, eighty, or even ninety years old without ever taking on the dignified, kindly demeanor of the elderly. A ridiculous old age is perhaps the final and possibly the saddest surprise that human nature can spring on us.",21,RO005TR07

4296,1036,“Why not? Your brother is a great admirer of the classics. He can translate Virgil on sight. Note that I said Virgil and not Virgília . . . One mustn’t confuse the two . . .”,21,RO005TR07
4297,1037,"And he laughed, a loud, bawdy, frivolous laugh. Sabina looked at me, fearing my response, but she smiled when she saw me smile, then turned away to hide her own smile. The guests looked at me with an air of curiosity, indulgence, and sympathy; they had clearly not heard anything new. The matter of my dalliance was more public than I had imagined. Nevertheless I smiled, a quick, fleeting, greedy smile, as indiscreet as the chattering magpies of Sintra. Virgília was a beautiful mistake, and it is so easy to confess to a beautiful mistake!",21,RO005TR07
4298,1038,"Initially, whenever I heard some allusion to our affair, I would cultivate a surly frown, but—word of honor!—inside I felt a soft, flattering sensation. Once, however, I smiled instead, and continued to do so on future occasions. Is there anyone among you who can explain this phenomenon? I explain it as follows: at the beginning, my contentment was, so to speak, the smile itself, but it was curled up in a little bud inside me. Then, as time went on, it blossomed into a flower and became visible to everyone. A simple question of botany.",21,RO005TR07

4303,1043,“Why?”,21,RO005TR07
4304,1044,"“You know very well why,” he replied. “Above all, it’s dangerous, very dangerous. Here in the capital a thing like that gets lost in the crowd, but out in the provinces it’s an entirely different matter, and the fact that politicians are involved makes it even more foolish. As soon as the opposition newspapers get wind of the story, they’ll publish it in all its gory details, and it’ll then become the stuff of jokes, snide remarks, nicknames . . .”",21,RO005TR07

I repeat: Do not make that journey. Just let her go, because that is preferable to some major scandal or worse.”",21,RO005TR07
4307,1047,"He said this and went back into the room. I remained at the window, gazing at the streetlamp on the corner. It was an old streetlamp, sad, dark, and curved like a question mark. What should I do? It was Hamlet’s predicament: either give in to outrageous fortune, or fight and overcome it. In other words: To sail or not to sail. That was the question. The streetlamp gave no answer. Cotrim’s words reverberated in my ears in a very different way than Garcez’s words. Perhaps Cotrim was right, but could I tear myself away from Virgília?",21,RO005TR07
4308,1048,"Sabina came over to join me, and asked what I was thinking about. I replied I wasn’t thinking of anything, and that I was feeling sleepy and was going home. Sabina paused for a moment.",21,RO005TR07

I immediately wrote to Virgília, and two hours later made my way to Gamboa. Poor Dona Plácida! She was becoming increasingly upset, asking me if we would forget our dear old servant, how long we would be away for, and whether the province was very far from Rio. I tried to console her, but I myself was in need of consolation; I was troubled by what Cotrim had said. Virgília arrived shortly afterward, lively as a swallow, but on seeing me so downcast she became serious.",21,RO005TR07

His father had died on the thirteenth, thirteen days after hosting a dinner for thirteen people. The house in which his mother had died was a number thirteen. Et cetera. For him, it was a fateful number. He couldn’t admit such a thing to the minister; he would tell him, instead, that he had personal reasons for not accepting. I was left somewhat dumbstruck—as the reader will be too—at this sacrifice for the sake of a number. But given how ambitious he was, the sacrifice must have been genuine.",21,RO005TR07

So must the auburn-haired virgins of Thebes have blessed the mare, with its fiery red mane, which took their place in the sacrifice before Pelopidas—a fine mare that died covered in garlands, but with no one uttering so much as a word of mourning. So now I mourn you, pious mare, not just for the death you suffered, but because it’s not impossible that among those damsels who escaped unscathed, there may have been a maternal ancestor of the Cubas dynasty.",21,RO005TR07
4326,1066,"Fateful number, you were our salvation. Lobo Neves never confided in me the real reason for his refusal; he told me that it was for personal reasons, and the grave, credulous face with which I listened to him was a tribute to the human ability to dissemble. It was he who could scarcely conceal the deep sadness tormenting him; he spoke little, turned in on himself, and stayed at home, reading. When they did receive guests, he would talk and laugh in a loud, rather affected manner.",21,RO005TR07
4327,1067,"Two things weighed on him: ambition, which had had its wings clipped by a mere scruple, quickly followed by doubt, and perhaps regret—but a regret that would have returned whenever the situation arose again, because the underlying superstition was still there inside him. He doubted that superstition, but could not bring himself to reject it. The persistence of a sentiment so repugnant to the individual concerned was a phenomenon worthy of some attention, but I preferred Dona Plácida’s straightforward guilelessness when she confessed that she could not bear to see a shoe lying with its sole turned upward.",21,RO005TR07

4332,1072,"Whether you got a wart or something else, what did it matter to someone who had lost the governorship of a province? You can tolerate a superstition that costs little or nothing, but one that takes away part of your life is unbearable. This was the case with Lobo Neves, along with the additional worries and fears that he had behaved like a fool. And there was a further factor: the minister didn’t believe Lobo Neves’s “personal reasons” and attributed his refusal to political intrigue, an illusion that had an element of plausibility. The minister became brusque with him, and conveyed his distrust to his colleagues; various other incidents ensued. In due course, the erstwhile governor-designate went over to the opposition.",21,RO005TR07

Thus the governorship’s sole effect was to revive our earlier passions; it was the drug with which we made our love more piquant, and also more precious. In the days immediately following those events, we amused ourselves by imagining the pain of our separation, our mutual sadness deepening as the sea, like an elastic canvas, stretched ever wider between us. And, like children who hide in their mother’s lap to escape an unfriendly face, we fled from our imaginary peril by clinging still more tightly to each other.",21,RO005TR07

A subtle fluid flowed throughout my whole body; a strong, swift, peculiar sensation that I will never manage to set down on paper. I grasped her hands, pulled her gently toward me, and kissed her on the forehead with all the delicacy of a breeze and the solemnity of Abraham.

Jacó reflected for a moment and had to accept the accuracy of my observation, but excused himself by saying that absolute truthfulness was incompatible with any advanced society, and that the peacefulness of our cities could only be maintained at the expense of reciprocal deceit.

4388,1128,"NOTHING. No testamentary remembrance, not even a lozenge, which might have given him a semblance of someone who was not entirely ungrateful or uncaring. Nothing. Virgília was furious at this setback, although she told me about it with a certain degree of caution, not on account of the matter itself, but because it concerned her son, whom she knew I didn’t like very much, or even a little. I suggested to her that she try not to think about it. The best thing was to forget all about the miserly old fool, and talk about happier matters; our child, for example . . .",21,RO005TR07
4389,1129,"There, I’ve just let slip the solution to the mystery, that sweet mystery of several weeks earlier when Virgília seemed somewhat different than her usual self. A child! A being drawn from my own being! It was the only thing I could think about during that period. The eyes of the world, her husband’s jealousy, Viegas’s death, nothing else interested me, neither political conflicts, nor revolutions, nor earthquakes, nothing. I could think only of that anonymous embryo, of obscure paternity, and a secret voice telling me: “It’s yours.” My own son! And I repeated those two words over and over with a certain indefinable voluptuousness, and perhaps occasional twinges of pride. I felt myself to be a man.",21,RO005TR07

The young whippersnapper adored me; he was a funny little rascal, pummeling my face with his small chubby hands, or pulling on his lawyer’s robes, because he would, of course, be a lawyer and make a speech in the Chamber of Deputies, with his proud father listening to him from the gallery, eyes brimming with tears. From lawyer he would return to his school days, a little boy once again, with books and slate under his arm, or he would drop back into his cradle, only to rise up once again as a man.",21,RO005TR07

Sometimes when I was with Virgília, I would entirely forget about her and everything else; Virgília would shake me then and scold me for my silence, saying I no longer loved her. The truth is, I was talking to the embryo, that old conversation between Adam and Cain, a wordless conversation between life and life, between mystery and mystery.",21,RO005TR07

4395,1135,"My dear Brás Cubas,",21,RO005TR07
4396,1136,"Some time ago, in the Passeio Público, I borrowed a watch from you. I now have the satisfaction of returning it to you with this letter. The only difference is that it is not the same watch but another, I shan’t say superior, but certainly equal to the first. As Figaro says: “Que voulez-vous, monseigneur? C’est la misère.”##### Many things have happened since our meeting; I will tell you in detail, if you won’t slam your door in my face. You should know that I no longer wear those decrepit boots, nor that infamous frock coat, with those coattails from another era, lost in the mists of time. I have given up my step at the entrance to the church; I even eat breakfast nowadays.",21,RO005TR07
4397,1137,"All that said, I would like to drop by one of these days and show you some of my work, the fruit of long study. It is a new system of philosophy, which not only explains and describes the origin and consummation of things, but also makes great strides beyond Zeno and Seneca, whose stoicism was mere child’s play when set beside my moral formula. This system of mine is singularly astonishing; it rectifies the human spirit, eliminates pain, ensures happiness, and fills our nation with immense glory. I call it Humanitism, from Humanitas, from which all things come.",21,RO005TR07
4398,1138,"At first, I was going to call it Borbism, from Borba, but this was sheer vanity, a name as conceited as it was crude and tiresome. And certainly less expressive. You will see, my dear Brás Cubas, you will see that it truly is a monument, and if there is anything capable of making me forget life’s disappointments, it is the pleasure of having at last grasped both truth and happiness. Here I hold them in my grasp, those two elusive fellows; after so many centuries of struggle, investigation, discoveries, systems and failures, here they lie within man’s grasp.

4401,1141,"I read this letter without understanding it. It came with a little case containing a fine watch engraved with my initials and these words: Best wishes from old Quincas. I returned to the letter, reread it slowly and attentively. The return of the watch precluded any notion of trickery; the lucidity, serenity, and conviction—somewhat boastful, certainly—also seemed to exclude any suspicion of insanity. Quincas Borba had clearly inherited money from one of his relatives in Minas Gerais, and wealth had restored to him his former dignity. Perhaps I shouldn’t put it as strongly as that; there are things that can never be fully restored, but rehabilitation is not impossible. I put away the letter and the watch, and awaited the philosophy.",21,RO005TR07

4404,1144,"ENOUGH OF THESE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. I had just put away the letter and the watch, when a thin man of medium height came looking for me with a note from Cotrim, inviting me to supper. The bearer of the note was married to one of Cotrim’s sisters, and had arrived from the north a few days earlier. His name was Damasceno and he had taken part in the revolution of 1831. It was he himself who told me this, within five minutes of meeting me. He had left Rio de Janeiro on account of his disagreement with the regent, who was an ass, albeit a little less of an ass than the ministers who served under him.",21,RO005TR07
4405,1145,"Besides, revolution was once again at the gates. On this point, although his political ideas were somewhat muddled, I managed to piece together his preferences on matters of government: it was for a tempered despotism—tempered not by epigrams, as they say elsewhere, but by the plumed helmets of the National Guard. I could not, however, make out whether he favored the despotism of one, three, thirty, or three hundred persons. He had opinions on various matters, among them the development of the slave trade and the expulsion of the English. He was very keen on the theater, and, as soon as he arrived, had taken himself off to the Teatro de São Pedro to see an excellent drama called Maria Joana, and a very interesting comedy by the name of Kettly, or the Return to Switzerland.",21,RO005TR07
4406,1146,"He was also very fond of Deperini’s performance in Sapho, or perhaps it was Anna Bolena, I can’t remember which. But as for Candiani! Yes, sir, she was tip-top. Now he wanted to hear Ernani, which his daughter often sang at home, accompanying herself on the piano: “Ernani, Ernani, involami . . .” he began crooning in a low voice, rising to his feet. In the north, these things were mere distant echoes. His daughter was dying to hear all the operas. She had a very sweet voice, his daughter. And taste, impeccable taste. Oh, he’d been so looking forward to coming back to Rio! He had already been round the whole city . . . so full of memories . . .",21,RO005TR07
4407,1147,"Word of honor, in some places he’d nearly cried. He would never board a ship again. He’d been very seasick, like all the passengers except for one Englishman . . . The devil take those wretched Englishmen! Things would never be sorted until every last one of them had packed his bags and gone. What could England do for us? If he could find a couple of willing assistants, it would be a single night’s work to get rid of all those Goddamns, as he liked to call them . . . He was a patriotic fellow, thank God—and at this he thumped his chest—which was scarcely surprising, since patriotism ran in his family; he was descended from a very patriotic military governor from back in the good old days.",21,RO005TR07
4408,1148,"Yes, sir! He was not just some nobody. If the time came, and he had to show what stuff he was made of . . . But it was getting late; I said he could count on me coming to supper, and that we would carry on our conversation there. I accompanied him to the door of the drawing room; he paused to say that he’d taken a great liking to me. I had been in Europe when he married Cotrim’s sister. He knew my father, a fine upstanding man, in fact they’d both danced at a famous ball at Praia Grande . . . So many things to discuss! We would talk again later; it was getting late; he had to take my answer back to Cotrim. He left, and I shut the door behind him.",21,RO005TR07

4411,1151,"WHAT TORTURE THAT SUPPER WAS! Fortunately, Sabina seated me next to Damasceno’s daughter, a charming young lady by the name of Dona Eulália, or, more familiarly, Nhã-loló. She was a little shy at first, but only at first. She lacked elegance, but made up for it with her eyes, which were superb and had the sole defect of never tearing themselves away from me, except when looking down at her plate. Nhã-loló, however, ate so little that she almost never looked at her plate. After supper, she sang; her voice was, as her father said, “very sweet.” Nevertheless, I slipped away. Sabina came with me to the door, and asked what I thought of Damasceno’s daughter.",21,RO005TR07

4416,1156,"As she said this, she lightly tapped my cheek with her fingers, a touch that was as tender as a dove, and, at the same time, stern and resolute. Good God! Was this the reason for our reconciliation? I felt somewhat dispirited at the thought, but a mysterious voice was summoning me to Lobo Neves’s house.

She was standing alone by a window, gazing up at the moon, and had greeted me cheerily, but when I made that allusion to our child, she pulled a face. She didn’t like me mentioning it, and my premature adoption of paternal endearments irritated her. I, for whom she was already a sacred person, a divine vessel, let her alone. I had at first supposed that the embryo, this little scrap of the unknown thrusting itself into our love affair, had restored to her a sense of sin.",21,RO005TR07
4421,1161,"I was wrong. Virgília had never seemed more expansive, less inhibited, or less concerned about other people and her husband. So it wasn’t remorse. I also wondered if the pregnancy might be pure invention, a means of binding me to her—a ruse that would not last long and was perhaps beginning to weigh on her. This hypothesis was not so very absurd; my dear sweet Virgília did sometimes tell lies, and very charmingly too!",21,RO005TR07
4422,1162,"That night, I discovered the real cause. It was her fear of childbirth and the inconvenience of being pregnant. She had suffered greatly when her first child was born, and that experience, made up of minutes of life interspersed with minutes of death, was already sending imaginary shivers down her spine, like a prisoner before the gallows. As for the inconvenience, this was made worse because she was obliged to give up certain aspects of her elegant lifestyle. No doubt that’s what it was. I told her as much, scolding her somewhat in the name of my paternal rights. Virgília stared at me, then looked away with an incredulous smile on her lips.",21,RO005TR07

I heard the news from the lips of Lobo Neves, who left me waiting in the drawing room while he accompanied the doctor to the thwarted mother’s bedroom.

4428,1168,"I FELT SOMEONE TAP ME on the shoulder; it was Lobo Neves. We stood facing each other for a few seconds, both of us silent and inconsolable. I asked about Virgília, and we stayed talking for half an hour. Then a letter was brought to him; he read it, turned very pale, then folded the letter up with a trembling hand. I think he made as if to hurl himself at me, but I don’t remember exactly. What I do recall very clearly is that he treated me very coldly during the days that followed and barely spoke. Finally, a few days later in Gamboa, Virgília told me everything.",21,RO005TR07
4429,1169,"Her husband had shown her the letter as soon as she had recovered. It was an anonymous letter denouncing our affair. It did not reveal everything; it did not, for example, mention our meetings outside of their home, but merely alerted him to my intimacy with her, adding that everyone knew about it. Virgília had read the letter and said indignantly that it was an outrageous slander.",21,RO005TR07

4432,1172,"Her husband gave a sigh of relief; but when he reread the letter, every word of it seemed to wag its finger at him, contradicting her denial, every letter of every word crying out against his wife’s indignation. For a man who was otherwise so fearless, he was now the most fragile of creatures. Perhaps his imagination showed him, in the distance, the famous eye of public opinion, leering at him sarcastically, roguishly; perhaps an invisible mouth whispered in his ear the kind of jeering comments he had heard or even himself said on other occasions. He insisted that his wife confess everything to him, for he would forgive her everything.",21,RO005TR07
4433,1173,"Virgília knew then that she was safe; she pretended to be annoyed at his insistence, and swore that from me she had only ever heard gallant, courteous words. The letter must be from some spurned admirer. She referred to several—one who had brazenly courted her for three weeks, another who had written to her, and quite a few others. She gave their names, the circumstances, all the while trying to read her husband’s eyes, and she concluded by saying that in order not to give further credence to the slander, she would treat me in such a way that I would never return to their house.",21,RO005TR07
4434,1174,"I listened to all this, feeling somewhat troubled, not because of the additional precautions we would need to take from now on, perhaps even to the extent of me staying away from Lobo Neves’s house entirely, but because of Virgília’s apparent moral calm, her lack of emotion, fear, regret, even remorse. Noticing my concern, Virgília made me raise my head—because I was staring down at the floor—and told me rather bitterly:",21,RO005TR07
4435,1175,“You don’t deserve the sacrifices I’m making for you.”,21,RO005TR07
4436,1176,"I said nothing. It would have been foolish to argue that a frisson of fear and despair might restore the piquancy of earlier days; but had I said that, she would, quite possibly, by slow and deliberate degrees, have arrived at that frisson of fear and despair of her own accord.

Imagine the scene: in a little house in Gamboa, two people who have loved each other for a long time, one leaning over the other and kissing her on the forehead, and the other recoiling, as if she had just been touched by the lips of a dead man.

The anonymous letter would restore to our affair the salt of mystery and the pepper of danger; and it was, after all, a good thing that Virgília had managed to maintain her composure in that moment of crisis. After supper, I went to the Teatro de São Pedro. They were putting on a marvelous play in which Estela§§§§§§§ brought a tear to everyone’s eyes. I entered, cast a glance around the auditorium, and spotted Damasceno and his family in one of the boxes. His daughter was dressed with a new elegance and a certain refinement, which was hard to explain, since her father earned barely enough to get himself into debt; but then perhaps that was the explanation.",21,RO005TR07

She seemed to me prettier than she had at that supper. I found in her a certain ethereal delicacy wedded to the luster of earthly forms—a vague phrase, and appropriate in a chapter in which everything must be vague. Really, I don’t quite know how to tell you this, but I felt rather good beside that young lady, elegantly clothed in a fine dress, a dress that awoke the Tartuffe in me.",21,RO005TR07

Given the multiplicity of tasks and preoccupations of any given individual, habitual nudity would tend to blunt the senses and suppress sexual impulses, whereas clothing, by denying nature, whets and draws out one’s desires, stimulating and revitalizing them, and thereby furthers the onward march of civilization.

But during the next interval, just before the curtain went up, we met in one of the corridors where there was no one else about. He came over to me, all smiles and affability, led me into an alcove, where we spoke at length, although he, who seemed the most tranquil of men, did most of the talking. I asked after his wife; he replied that she was well, but then quickly turned the conversation back to more general topics, becoming expansive and almost jovial. Try to guess, if you can, the reason for this change; for my part, I have to flee from Damasceno, who has spotted me from the door of his box.",21,RO005TR07

Leaning back in my seat, I recalled scraps of Lobo Neves’s conversation, his general manner, and concluded that this new situation was far better than the old one. Gamboa was enough for us. Visiting the other house would merely foment jealousy. Strictly speaking, we could do away with the need to talk every day; it might even be better; absence, as they say, makes the heart grow fonder. Besides, I was now in my forties and had nothing to show for it; I wasn’t even parish councillor.

The present chapter is an example of the latter, and I recommend it to all those who enjoy the study of social phenomena. It would appear—and it is not improbable—that there exists between the public and private spheres a certain reciprocal, regular, and perhaps periodic rhythm—or, to make use of an image, there occurs something akin to the swelling tides on the beach at Flamengo and other such places. For when a wave sweeps in, it floods the beach to a certain depth, but that same water then returns to the sea, with varying strength, and feeds the next wave, which will then ebb back out like the first.

Thus the private matter of an aversion to a particular number produced the phenomenon of political discord. It still remains to be seen how, some time later, a political act caused a cessation of activity in private life. Since it does not suit the scheme of this book to describe this phenomenon immediately, I shall limit myself for the time being to saying that four months after my encounter with him at the theater, Lobo Neves became reconciled with the government, a fact that the reader should not lose sight of if he wishes to penetrate the subtle recesses of my thinking.",21,RO005TR07

For she really loved the nobility. One of the worst times during our life together was the appearance of a certain dandy from a diplomatic legation—the Dalmatian legation, let’s say—called Count B.V., who pursued Virgília for three months. This man, of truly noble stock, had somewhat turned Virgília’s head, not least on account of her own diplomatic vocation. I don’t know what would have become of me had a revolution not broken out in Dalmatia, overthrowing the government and purging all its embassies.

The newspapers that arrived with each ship from Europe described the horrors, calculated how much blood was shed, counted the heads; everyone trembled in outrage and pity. Not I.

4466,1206,"“NO, SIR, YOU CAN’T do such things. Forgive me, sir, but you can’t.”",21,RO005TR07
4467,1207,"Dona Plácida was right. No gentleman arrives an hour late at the place where his lady is expecting him. I arrived, out of breath, but Virgília had already left. Dona Plácida told me she had waited a long time, become angry, wept, sworn to treat me with the scorn I deserved, and said many other things that our housekeeper recounted to me, her voice breaking with emotion, begging me not to abandon her mistress, because it would be very wrong to do such a thing to a woman who had sacrificed everything for me. I explained to her that it was all a mistake . . . But it wasn’t, I think I had simply got distracted. Something someone had said, a conversation, an anecdote, anything really, yes, I had simply got distracted.",21,RO005TR07
4468,1208,"Poor Dona Plácida! She was genuinely distressed. She paced the room, shaking her head and sighing loudly, then peering out through the shutters. Poor Dona Plácida! With what skill she had tucked in the bedclothes, caressed the cheek and rocked to sleep all our little tantrums! What fertile imagination she had shown in making those hours more pleasurable and more fleeting! Flowers, sweets—those wonderful old-fashioned sweets—and much laughter, much affection; laughter and affection that grew over time, as if she wanted to preserve our love affair forever, or restore it to its first bloom.",21,RO005TR07
4469,1209,"Our housekeeper and confidante forgot nothing, nothing, not even lies, for she would relay to each of us sighs and longings she had not even witnessed; nor indeed slander, for she once went so far as to claim that I had a new lover. “You know I could never love another woman,” was my reply when Virgília asked me about it. And these words alone, without protest or reprimand, dispelled Dona Plácida’s treacherous accusation, but not her sadness.",21,RO005TR07
4470,1210,"“All right,” I said after a quarter of an hour. “Virgília must be made to understand that I’m not to blame in any way. Would you like to take a letter to her right now?”",21,RO005TR07
4471,1211,"“She must be very sad, poor thing! I wouldn’t wish anyone dead, but if one day you and my mistress should ever marry, then you’d see what an angel she is!”",21,RO005TR07
4472,1212,"I remember turning my head and gazing down at the floor. I recommend this gesture to anyone who doesn’t have a response readily to hand, or even to those who fear meeting the other person’s eyes. In such instances, some people prefer to recite a stanza from The Lusiads, whereas others opt for whistling a bar or two of Norma; I stick to the gesture already described; it’s much simpler and requires less effort.",21,RO005TR07
4473,1213,"Three days later, all was explained. I imagine Virgília was somewhat surprised when I begged her forgiveness for the tears she had shed on that sad occasion. Perhaps, deep down, I knew that those tears belonged to Dona Plácida. Indeed, it was entirely possible that Dona Plácida had wept on seeing Virgília’s distress, and a kind of optical illusion had led her to think the tears in her own eyes were falling from Virgília’s. Be that as it may, everything had been explained, but not forgiven, still less forgotten.",21,RO005TR07
4474,1214,"Virgília said many harsh things to me, threatened to leave me, and finished by praising her husband. He, Lobo Neves, was a worthy man, far worthier than me, polite, a paragon of courtesy and affection, she told me, while I sat, arms resting on my knees, staring down at the floor, where a fly was dragging away an ant, which in turn was biting the fly’s leg. Poor fly! Poor ant!",21,RO005TR07
4475,1215,"“But have you nothing to say for yourself? Nothing?” asked Virgília, standing in front of me.",21,RO005TR07
4476,1216,"“What can I say? I’ve explained everything, but you insist on being angry. What can I say? Do you know what I think? I think you’re fed up, that you’re bored with me and you want to end it . . .”",21,RO005TR07
4477,1217,“Exactly!”,21,RO005TR07
4478,1218,"She went to put on her hat, her hands trembling with rage.",21,RO005TR07
4479,1219,"“Farewell, Dona Plácida,” she called out.",21,RO005TR07
4480,1220,"Then she went to the door, slid back the bolt, and was about to leave. I grabbed her by the waist.",21,RO005TR07
4481,1221,"“Now, that’s enough,” I said to her.",21,RO005TR07
4482,1222,"Again Virgília tried to leave. I held her back, begged her to stay and forget all about it. She moved away from the door and slumped onto the sofa. I sat down beside her, and said many tender things to her, as well as some that were humble and others that were witty. I won’t say whether our lips came within a cambric thread’s breadth of each other, or even closer; that’s a moot point. I do, however, remember that, in the kerfuffle, one of Virgília’s earrings fell off, that I leaned over to pick it up, and that the aforementioned fly clambered over the earring, with the ant still attached to its leg.",21,RO005TR07
4483,1223,"Then I, with all the inherent delicacy of a man of our century, placed this pair of tormented creatures in the palm of my hand, calculated the full distance between my hand and the planet Saturn, and asked myself what possible interest there could be in so banal an episode. If you conclude from this that I was a barbarian, then you are wrong, because I asked Virgília for a hairpin in order to separate the two insects. The fly, though, guessed my intentions, opened its wings, and flew off. Poor fly! Poor ant! And God saw that it was good, as it says in the Scriptures.",21,RO005TR07
4484,1224,CHAPTER CIV,21,RO005TR07
4485,1225,It was him!,21,RO005TR07
4486,1226,"I RETURNED THE HAIRPIN to Virgília, who refastened it in her hair and prepared to leave. It was late; already gone three o’clock. Everything was forgotten and forgiven. Dona Plácida, who was watching for a safe moment for her mistress to leave, suddenly shut the window and exclaimed:",21,RO005TR07
4487,1227,“Holy Mother of God! The mistress’s husband is coming!”,21,RO005TR07
4488,1228,"The moment of terror was brief, but complete. Virgília turned the color of the lace on her dress and ran to the bedroom door; Dona Plácida, who had closed the outside shutter, tried to close the inside one too; I prepared myself to face Lobo Neves. This brief moment passed. Virgília regained her composure, propelled me toward the bedroom, and told Dona Plácida to return to the window. Dona Plácida obeyed.",21,RO005TR07
4489,1229,It was indeed him. Dona Plácida opened the door with many exclamations of surprise:,21,RO005TR07
4490,1230,"“You, sir! Here? Such an honor for the house of a poor old woman! Please come in. You’ll never guess who’s here with me . . . But of course you don’t need to guess; it’s the only reason you’ve come . . . Look who’s here, mistress!”",21,RO005TR07
4491,1231,"Virgília, who had retreated to a corner, rushed toward her husband. I peeked at them through the keyhole. Lobo Neves entered slowly, looking pale, cold, calm, with no great outburst of emotion or anger, and cast his eye around the room.",21,RO005TR07
4492,1232,“What’s this?” exclaimed Virgília. “What are you doing here?”,21,RO005TR07
4493,1233,"“I was passing by, saw Dona Plácida at the window, and came in to say hello.”",21,RO005TR07
4494,1234,"“I’m much obliged, sir,” replied the latter. “And they say old women aren’t worth the bother . . . Well, lookie here! If it isn’t the mistress getting all jealous!” Then, tenderly stroking Virgília, she went on: “This little angel never forgets old Plácida. Poor thing! She’s the very image of her mother . . . Do sit down, sir.”",21,RO005TR07
4495,1235,"“No, I’m not staying.”",21,RO005TR07
4496,1236,“Are you going home?” asked Virgília. “We can go together.”,21,RO005TR07
4497,1237,“All right.”,21,RO005TR07
4498,1238,"“Pass me my hat, Dona Plácida.”",21,RO005TR07
4499,1239,“Here you are.”,21,RO005TR07
4500,1240,"Dona Plácida went to fetch a folding mirror and held it up in front of Virgília. Virgília put on her hat, tied the ribbons, and smoothed her hair, all the while speaking to her husband, who made no reply. Our trusty old housekeeper prattled on excessively; it was her way of disguising how much she was trembling. Virgília had already overcome the initial shock and quickly regained her poise.",21,RO005TR07
4501,1241,"“Ready!” she said. “Goodbye, Dona Plácida. Now, don’t forget to come by, will you?”",21,RO005TR07
4502,1242,"Dona Plácida promised she wouldn’t, and opened the door for them.",21,RO005TR07

4504,1244,The equivalence of windows,21,RO005TR07
4505,1245,"DONA PLÁCIDA shut the door and collapsed into a chair. I immediately came out of the bedroom and took a couple of steps toward the door, intending to follow them into the street and snatch Virgília from her husband. At least that’s what I said I would do, and it was as well that I did say it, because Dona Plácida grabbed my arm and held me back. There was a time when I wondered whether I had said it only so that she would hold me back, but a moment’s reflection is enough to show that, after ten minutes in the bedroom, there could be no more genuine and heartfelt impulse than that. And all because of the famous law of the equivalence of windows, which I had the satisfaction of discovering and formulating in Chapter LI. I needed to air my conscience. The bedroom was a closed window; I opened another with the intention of leaving and taking a deep breath.",21,RO005TR07
4506,1246,CHAPTER CVI,21,RO005TR07
4507,1247,A dangerous game,21,RO005TR07
4508,1248,"I TOOK A DEEP BREATH and sat down. The room resounded with Dona Plácida’s cries and lamentations. I listened without saying anything; I was wondering if it wouldn’t have been better for me to have stayed in the drawing room and locked Virgília in the bedroom. But I quickly realized that this would have been much worse; it would have confirmed his suspicions, lit the touch paper, and a bloody scene would have followed . . . No, it was much better this way. But what next? What would happen when they got home? Would he kill her? Would he beat her? Lock her up? Send her away? These questions drifted slowly around in my brain, the way full stops and commas drift across the field of vision of the eyes of the tired or ailing. They came and went, looking dull and tragic, and I was unable to grab one of them and say: “It’s you, you and no other.”",21,RO005TR07
4509,1249,"Suddenly I saw a dark shape: it was Dona Plácida, who had gone back inside, put on her black shawl, and was now offering to go to Lobo Neves’s house on my behalf. I thought it risky. After all, wouldn’t he be suspicious of her visiting so soon?",21,RO005TR07
4510,1250,"“Don’t worry,” she interrupted. “I know how to handle things. If he’s there, I won’t go in.”",21,RO005TR07
4511,1251,"She left, and I stayed, pondering the incident and its possible consequences. In the end, it seemed to me I was playing a dangerous game, and I asked myself whether it wasn’t time for a change of scene. I was seized by a longing for marriage, a desire for some direction in my life. Why not? My heart still had some exploring to do; I did not feel myself incapable of a pure, austere, chaste love. After all, love affairs are the giddy and torrential part of life, that is, the exception to the rule. I was sick of them; I may even have felt some remorse. No sooner had the thought occurred to me than I let myself be carried away by my imagination; I saw myself married and sitting alongside an adorable wife, gazing down at a baby asleep in its nanny’s lap, all four of us at the bottom of a shady, verdant garden, looking up through the trees at a sliver of blue, extremely blue, sky . . .",21,RO005TR07

4514,1254,"NOTHING HAPPENED, but he clearly suspects something. He’s very serious and doesn’t speak. He’s just gone out. He smiled only once, at Nhonhô, after staring at him for a long time with a frown on his face. He didn’t treat me well or badly. I don’t know what’s going to happen; it will all blow over, God willing. Extreme caution for now, though, extreme caution.",21,RO005TR07

4516,1256,Things that can’t be understood,21,RO005TR07
4517,1257,"THERE YOU HAVE THE DRAMA; there you have the tip of Shakespeare’s tragic ear. That little scrap of crumpled paper, scrawled on in places, was a document in need of analysis, which I shall not give in either this chapter or the next, or perhaps in the rest of this book. How could I possibly deprive the reader of the pleasure of noting for himself the cool, shrewd resolve of those few hastily scribbled lines; and behind them the tempest raging in another’s mind, the concealed fury, the despair that holds itself in and meditates, because it must resolve itself into mud, or blood, or tears?",21,RO005TR07
4518,1258,"As for me, if I were to tell you that I read the note three or four times that day, you may believe it because it’s true; if I were also to tell you that I reread it the following day, before and after breakfast, you can also believe it, for it is the pure truth. But if I were to tell you of the shock I felt, you might possibly doubt that assertion, and not accept it without proof. Neither then nor now have I managed to discern clearly what I felt. It was fear and it was not fear; it was pain and it was not pain; it was vanity and yet not vanity. All in all, it was love without love, that is, minus the passion. All this made for a rather vague and complex combination, a thing you might not understand, just as I did not understand. Let’s just pretend I said nothing.",21,RO005TR07
4519,1259,CHAPTER CIX,21,RO005TR07
4520,1260,The philosopher,21,RO005TR07
4521,1261,"KNOWING THAT I REREAD the note before and after breakfast, you can deduce that I did have breakfast, and I will merely add that this meal was one of the most frugal of my entire life: an egg, a slice of bread, and a cup of tea. I have not forgotten this minor detail; that breakfast has survived, while so many other important things have been obliterated. The principal reason for this could well have been the disaster that befell me, but it wasn’t. The principal reason was the thought expressed to me by Quincas Borba, who visited me that day.",21,RO005TR07
4522,1262,"He told me that frugality was unnecessary to an understanding of Humanitism, and even less so to its practice, for this philosophy easily accommodated itself to the pleasures of life, including those of the table, the theater, and the flesh, and that, on the contrary, frugality could well indicate a certain tendency toward asceticism, which was the crowning expression of human folly.",21,RO005TR07
4523,1263,"“Just look at Saint John,” he continued. “He lived off locusts in the wilderness, instead of growing peacefully plump in the city while thinning out Pharisee tendencies in the synagogue.”",21,RO005TR07
4524,1264,"I will not recount Quincas Borba’s story, a story I heard in its entirety on that gloomy occasion. It is a long and complicated tale, although not without interest. And since I’m not going to tell his story, I shall likewise refrain from describing his appearance, which was very different from his appearance when I encountered him in the Passeio Público. I will say nothing, or only that if a man’s principal characteristics are to be found not in his features but in his clothes, then that man was not Quincas Borba; he was a judge without his robes, a general without his uniform, a banker without his bonus. I noted the perfect cut of his frock coat, the whiteness of his shirt, the shine of his boots.",21,RO005TR07
4525,1265,"His very voice, so hoarse before, seemed to have regained its earlier sonorous quality. And while his gestures had lost none of their former vivacity, they had become more orderly, and were subject to some sort of method. But I do not want to describe him. If I were to speak, for example, of the gold stud he wore on his shirtfront, and of the quality of the leather on his boots, I would be beginning a description that I am omitting for the sake of brevity. Content yourself with the knowledge that his boots were made of patent leather. You may further wish to know that he had inherited a tidy fortune from an elderly uncle in Barbacena.",21,RO005TR07
4526,1266,"On that occasion, my mind (if you’ll allow me a childish comparison!) was a kind of shuttlecock. Quincas Borba’s story gave it a good thwack and up it went; when it was about to fall, Virgília’s note gave it another thwack and once again it was flung into the air, then fell again, and the episode in the Passeio Público greeted it with another thwack, equally firm and equally effective. I don’t think I was born for complex situations. This pushing and pulling of opposing things threw me off balance; I wanted to wrap up Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves, and Virgília’s note in the same philosophy, and send them as a gift to Aristotle. Nevertheless, our philosopher’s tale proved instructive; I especially admired his talent for observation in describing the gestation and growth of his vices, the internal struggles, the slow capitulations, the gradual slide into the gutter.",21,RO005TR07
4527,1267,"“Look,” he said, “the first night I spent on the steps of the church of São Francisco, I slept the whole night through, as if on the finest down mattress. Why? Because I moved very gradually from a bed with a mattress to a wooden bunk, from my own room to the police station, and from the police station to the street . . .”",21,RO005TR07
4528,1268,"Finally, he expressed a wish to explain his philosophy to me; I asked him not to.",21,RO005TR07

4530,1270,"Quincas Borba gave a mischievous smile; perhaps he knew about my affair, but he said nothing. The only words he added were these, as he was leaving:",21,RO005TR07
4531,1271,"“Come and join Humanitism. It is a great refuge for the mind, the eternal sea into which I have dived in order to seek out the truth. The Greeks thought truth was to be found in a well. What a wretched notion! I mean, a well, of all things! That’s why they never found it. Greeks, sub-Greeks, and anti-Greeks, the whole lot of them have been crouching over that well waiting for the truth to emerge, but it isn’t there. They used up all their ropes and buckets; some of the more adventurous ones even went down to the bottom and brought back a toad. I went straight to the sea. Come and join Humanitism.”",21,RO005TR07

4534,1274,"ONE WEEK LATER, Lobo Neves was appointed provincial governor. I clung to the hope that he would refuse again if the decree was dated the thirteenth.

4537,1277,"SINCE IT IS NOT MY HABIT to conceal or hide anything, I shall tell you about the episode of the wall here on this very page. Lobo Neves and Virgília were just about to depart. On entering Dona Plácida’s house, I saw on the table a small folded piece of paper; it was a note from Virgília saying that she would be waiting for me that night in the garden, without fail. And it concluded: The wall is lower where it meets the path.",21,RO005TR07
4538,1278,"I tut-tutted to myself. The letter seemed to me uncommonly audacious, ill-conceived, and even ridiculous. It was not merely inviting scandal, it was inviting both scandal and mockery combined. I imagined myself shinning up the wall, albeit low and near the path, and, just as I was about to swing my leg over the top, a passing constable grabbing me and marching me off to the police station. The wall is lower there! So what if it is? Clearly Virgília wasn’t thinking straight; it was also possible she had already thought better of it. I looked at the piece of paper, crumpled but unyielding. I was itching to rip it into lots of little pieces and throw them to the winds, as the last vestige of our affair. But I stopped just in time; my self-respect, the humiliation of running away, the notion of fear . . . There was nothing for it but to go.",21,RO005TR07

4546,1286,"A very odd feeling came over me. I reread the piece of paper, looked at it, then looked at it again. It was, indeed, an old note from Virgília, received at the very beginning of our romance. A rendezvous in the garden, which had indeed led me to jump over that wall, that low, discreet wall. I put the note away and . . . Yes, it was a very odd feeling.",21,RO005TR07

4548,1288,Public opinion,21,RO005TR07
4549,1289,"BUT IT WAS WRITTEN that this was to be a day of dubious events. A few hours later, I met Lobo Neves on Rua do Ouvidor. We talked about the governorship and about politics. When an acquaintance of his passed by, he seized the opportunity to leave me, after many effusive words of farewell. I recall him being rather reticent, but that he had to struggle to hide this reticence. At the time, it seemed to me (and I beg my critics’ pardon if I’m leaping to conclusions!) that he was afraid—not of me, nor of himself, the law, or his conscience; he was afraid of public opinion.",21,RO005TR07
4550,1290,"I supposed that this anonymous, invisible court, in which every member is both prosecutor and judge, was the limit placed on Lobo Neves’s free will. Perhaps he no longer loved his wife, and, thus, it may well be that his heart was untroubled by his indulgent response to her more recent actions. I think (and once again I require my critics’ indulgence!) that he may have been ready to separate from his wife, just as the reader has probably separated from many such personal entanglements, but public opinion would have dragged his life through every street in the city, opened a painstaking investigation into every aspect of the affair, pieced together all the circumstances, antecedents, deductions, and proofs, and discussed these in the homes of the idle rich. This terrifying public opinion, which is always so curious about bedrooms, ruled out the breakup of his family.",21,RO005TR07

4552,1292,"At the same time, it made revenge impossible, for revenge would mean revelation. He couldn’t appear resentful toward me without also seeking conjugal separation; he therefore had to continue to feign ignorance and, by extension, the sentiments that accompanied said ignorance.",21,RO005TR07
4553,1293,"I imagine it was difficult for him, especially then; seeing me must have been very difficult for him indeed. But time (and this is another point on which I beg the indulgence of all thinking men!), time hardens the sensibilities and dims the memory; no doubt the years would blunt the thorns, events would grow more distant and their contours become blurred, a shadow of retrospective doubt would cloak the naked truth, and public opinion would concern itself with other scandals. As his son grew up, he would seek to satisfy his father’s ambitions, and would become the heir to all his affections. That and outside activities, public prestige, followed by old age, illness, decline, death, a short liturgy, and an obituary, and the book of life would be closed, without a single bloodstained page.",21,RO005TR07

4556,1296,"IF THERE IS ANY CONCLUSION to be drawn from the preceding chapter, it is that public opinion is an excellent solder for domestic institutions. It is not impossible that I will develop this thought further before finishing the book, but it is also not impossible that I will leave it as it is. Either way, public opinion is an excellent solder, both in politics and in domestic affairs. Some peevish metaphysicians have taken the extreme position of calling public opinion the mere product of the dull and mediocre, but it is clear that, even when so extraordinary a notion does not contain its own refutation, one merely needs to consider the salutary effects of public opinion in order to conclude that it is the very finest achievement of the flower of mankind, that is, of the greater number.",21,RO005TR07

4576,1316,"I DIDN’T GO TO SEE HER OFF. At the allotted hour I felt something that was neither pain nor pleasure, but something in between, relief and regret combined in equal doses. I hope the reader won’t feel irritated by this confession. I know very well that in order to titillate the reader’s imagination, I ought to be plunged into deep despair, shed a few tears, and certainly not have lunch. That would be worthy of a novel, but not an autobiography. The simple truth is that I had lunch as I did every day, nourishing my heart with memories of my affair, and my stomach with Monsieur Prudhon’s finest hors d’oeuvres . . .",21,RO005TR07
4577,1317,". . . Aging contemporaries of mine, perhaps you remember Monsieur Prudhon, the master chef at the Hotel Pharoux? According to the hotel’s owner, he had worked at the Véry and Le Grand Véfour, those famous restaurants in Paris, and also at the palaces of Comte Molé and the Duc de la Rochefoucauld. He was very famous. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro at the same time as the polka . . . The polka, Monsieur Prudhon, the Tivoli, the foreigners’ ball, the Cassino—these are some of the best memories I have of those times. But above all, Monsieur Prudhon’s hors d’oeuvres, which were delicious.",21,RO005TR07
4578,1318,"They were indeed, and on that morning it seemed as if that devil of a Frenchman had sensed my misfortune. Never had his skill and artistry been so propitious. Such sophisticated seasoning! Such tender meats! Such refined presentation! One ate with one’s mouth, one’s eyes, and one’s nose. I didn’t keep the bill for that meal; I know it was expensive. Given the pain I was feeling, though, I needed to give my love a magnificent funeral. Off they went, across the sea in both space and time, and there I sat at a table with my forty-something years of idleness and emptiness, never to see them again, because while she might and indeed did return, who would ever think of asking for the sweet scent of morning as evening falls?",21,RO005TR07

4581,1321,"I WAS SO SADDENED by the end of the last chapter that I was almost tempted not to write this one, but rather to rest a little, clear my mind of the melancholy weighing upon it, and then continue later on. But no, I don’t want to waste time.",21,RO005TR07
4582,1322,"Virgília’s departure gave me a taste of what it’s like to be a widower. For the first few days I stayed at home, impaling flies, if Suetonius isn’t lying, as, Domitian used to do, but impaling them in my own way: with my eyes. I caught them one by one, as I lay stretched out in a hammock at the far end of a large room, an open book in my hands. My feelings then were a combination of everything: nostalgia, ambition, a little boredom, and a lot of daydreaming. My uncle the canon died during this period, as did two cousins. I didn’t feel upset; I took them to the cemetery, like someone taking money to the bank. No, what am I saying? Like someone taking letters to the post office: I sealed the letters, put them in the slot, and left it to the postman to deliver them to the right place. It was also around this time that my niece Venância, Cotrim’s daughter, was born. Some died, others were born; I continued catching flies.",21,RO005TR07
4583,1323,"At other times, I kept myself busy. I would go through my drawers, rummaging through old letters from friends, relatives, sweethearts (even from Marcela), and opening them all, reading them one by one, and reconstructing the past . . . Ignorant reader, if you do not keep the letters from your youth, you will never come to know the philosophy of old letters; you will not taste the delights of seeing yourself, far off in the half-light, sporting a tricorn hat, seven-league boots, and a long Assyrian beard, dancing to the sound of a set of anacreontic bagpipes. Be sure to keep the letters from your youth!",21,RO005TR07
4584,1324,"Or, if the tricorn hat doesn’t appeal to you, then in the words of an old sailor often to be seen at Cotrim’s house, you will, if you keep the letters from your youth, find occasion to “sing a yearning.” This, it seems, is the name our sailors give to songs composed on dry land when they are sung on the high seas. As a poetical expression, it is the saddest thing you could possibly ask for.",21,RO005TR07
4585,1325,CHAPTER CXVII,21,RO005TR07
4586,1326,Humanitism,21,RO005TR07
4587,1327,"TWO FORCES, however (along with a third, of which more anon), compelled me to return to the hustle and bustle of everyday life: Sabina and Quincas Borba. My sister had set about promoting the conjugal candidacy of Nhã-loló with such energy that, before I knew it, the young lady was practically in my arms. As for Quincas Borba, he finally explained Humanitism to me, a system of philosophy that was destined to destroy all other systems.",21,RO005TR07
4588,1328,"“Humanitas,” he said, “as the founding principle of all things, is neither more nor less than the same man shared out among all men. It has three phases: the static, prior to all creation; the expansive, the beginning of things; the dispersive, the appearance of man; and it will have one more, the contractive, the absorption of man and things. The expansion, which initiated the universe, prompted in Humanitas the desire to enjoy it, hence the dispersion, which is, quite simply, the personified multiplication of the original substance.”",21,RO005TR07
4589,1329,"Since this explanation did not seem entirely clear to me, Quincas Borba developed it at a deeper level, drawing out the main features of the system. He explained to me that, on the one hand, Humanitism was connected with Brahmanism, that is, the distribution of men throughout the different parts of the body of Humanitas, but that while in the Indian religion those aspects have only a narrow theological and political significance, in Humanitism they constituted the great law of personal value. Thus, being descended from the chest or kidneys of Humanitas, i.e., being strong, was not the same as being descended from the hair or from the tip of the nose. Hence the need to cultivate and strengthen one’s muscles. Hercules was simply an early symbol of Humanitism.",21,RO005TR07
4590,1330,"On this point, Quincas Borba considered that paganism could well have arrived at the truth, had it not debased itself with the amorous frivolity of its myths. Nothing like that will happen with Humanitism. In this new church there will be no easy conquests, no falls from grace, no sorrows or childish joys. Love, for example, is a priestly affair, and reproduction is a ritual. Since life is the universe’s greatest gift, and even beggars prefer a wretched existence to death (itself delightful proof of the influence of Humanitas), it follows that the transmission of life, far from being an occasion for amorous affections, is the high point of the spiritual mass. Thus there is only one genuine misfortune: that of not being born.",21,RO005TR07
4591,1331,"“Imagine, for example, that I had not been born,” continued Quincas Borba. “I would not now be having the pleasure of conversing with you, eating this potato, going to the theater, in short: living. Note that I do not make man a mere vehicle for Humanitas; no, he is at the same time vehicle, coachman, and passenger; he is the essence of Humanitas, from which flows the need to worship oneself. Do you want proof of the superiority of my system? Consider envy. There is no moralist, whether Greek or Turk, Christian or Muslim, who does not thunder against envy. There is universal agreement on the subject, from the plains of Idumea to the heights of Tijuca.",21,RO005TR07
4592,1332,"Well then, let go of those old preconceptions, forget that worn-out rhetoric, and study the noble and subtle sentiment of envy. Since every man is the very essence of Humanitas, it is clear that no man is fundamentally opposed to any other man, despite appearances to the contrary. Thus, for example, the hangman who executes the condemned man may arouse the futile indignation of poets, but, basically, he is simply Humanitas correcting in Humanitas a breach of the law of Humanitas. I would say the same of an individual who disembowels another; it is a manifestation of the force of Humanitas. Nothing prevents him (and there are plenty of examples of this) from also being disemboweled. If you have understood me correctly, you will see that envy is nothing but a combative form of admiration, and, since struggle is the main function of the human species, all forms of bellicose feelings are conducive to its happiness. From which it follows that envy is a virtue.”",21,RO005TR07
4593,1333,,21,RO005TR07
4594,1334,"How could one deny it? I was dumbstruck. The clarity of his explanation, the logic of his principles, and the rigor of his deductions were of such overwhelming grandeur that I had to break off our conversation for several minutes while I digested this new philosophy. Quincas Borba could barely conceal his satisfaction at this triumph. There was a chicken wing on his plate, and he was dissecting it with philosophical serenity. I raised a few objections, but they were so feeble that it took him little time to demolish them.",21,RO005TR07
4595,1335,"“If you are to understand my system properly,” he concluded, “you must never forget the universal principle, of which every man is both part and summation. You see: war, which seems a calamity, is a beneficial operation, merely a snap of Humanitas’s fingers, so to speak; hunger (and here he sucked philosophically on his chicken wing), hunger is proof that Humanitas is subject to its own guts. But I need no further documentary proof of the sublime nature of my system than this chicken right here.",21,RO005TR07
4596,1336,"It was fed on corn, which was planted by, let’s suppose, an African imported from Angola. This African was born, raised, and sold; a ship brought him here, a ship built of wood cut from the forest by ten or twelve men, and propelled by sails sewn by a further eight or ten men, not to mention the rigging and other bits and pieces of nautical apparatus. Thus, this chicken, which I have just eaten for my lunch, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles undertaken with the sole aim of satisfying my appetite.”",21,RO005TR07
4597,1337,"Between the cheese and the coffee, Quincas Borba demonstrated to me that his system meant the annihilation of pain. According to Humanitism, pain is pure illusion. When a child is threatened with a stick, he closes his eyes and trembles even before the blow is struck. This predisposition is what forms the basis of that human illusion, inherited and transmitted over the generations. Adopting the Humanitas system is certainly not in itself sufficient to bring an end to pain, but it is indispensable; the rest is down to natural evolution. Once man has truly realized that he himself is Humanitas, he needs only to trace the thought back to its original substance in order to block all and any painful sensations. This evolution, however, is so profound that it can take several thousand years.",21,RO005TR07
4598,1338,"A few days later, Quincas Borba read me his magnum opus. It consisted of four manuscript volumes of one hundred pages each, written in a tiny hand and complete with Latin quotations. The last volume consisted of a political treatise based on Humanitism; it was perhaps the most tedious part of the system, albeit subject to a logic of formidable rigor.",21,RO005TR07
4599,1339,"The reorganization of society in accordance with his method would not in itself eliminate war, insurrection, a straightforward punch, an anonymous stabbing, poverty, hunger, or disease, but since these so-called scourges were in actual fact errors of understanding (for they were nothing more than external movements of the inner substance and therefore destined to have no influence over man other than as a simple break from the universal monotony), it was clear that their existence would not stand in the way of human happiness.",21,RO005TR07
4600,1340,"However, if, in the future, such scourges (a radically false notion, as previously stated) should be seen to correspond to the narrow conceptions of former times, the system would still survive, and for two reasons: first, because Humanitas is the absolute all-creating substance, and each individual would therefore take the greatest pleasure in the world in sacrificing himself to the principle from which he descends; second, because even then man’s spiritual power over the Earth would not diminish, since the Earth was invented solely for his personal enjoyment, as were the stars, the winds, dates, and rhubarb. Pangloss, he told me as he closed the book, was not as foolish as Voltaire painted him.",21,RO005TR07

4628,1368,"THREE MONTHS LATER, everything was going swimmingly. The fluid, Sabina, the girl’s eyes, and her father’s wishes were among the many impulses driving me toward marriage. The memory of Virgília appeared from time to time at the door, and with her a black devil who held up a mirror to me, in which I could see Virgília in the distance, weeping profusely. But then another devil would appear, a pink one this time, holding up another mirror, in which I saw the tender, shining, angelic face of Nhã-loló.",21,RO005TR07
4629,1369,"I’ll say nothing of my age, because I did not feel it; I will even add that I had cast age aside one Sunday when I went to mass at the Livramento chapel. Since Damasceno lived in Cajueiros, I often accompanied the family to mass. There were still no houses on the hill leading up to it, except for the old mansion at the top, beside the chapel. That Sunday, walking back down with Nhã-loló on my arm, a strange phenomenon occurred, and I found myself losing two years here, four years there, another five farther on, so that when I reached the bottom, I was a mere twenty years old, and full of youthful vigor.",21,RO005TR07
4630,1370,"Now, if you want to know the circumstances under which this phenomenon occurred, simply read to the end of this chapter. We were coming back from mass, Nhã-loló, her father, and I. Halfway down the hill we came across a group of men. Damasceno, who was walking beside us, saw what was going on and hurried forward excitedly. Nhã-loló and I followed. And this is what we saw: men of all ages, sizes, and colors, some in shirtsleeves, some wearing jackets, others in tattered frock coats, were gathered around in various positions, some squatting, others leaning forward with hands on knees, some sitting on boulders, others leaning against the wall, and all of them with their eyes fixed on the center of the circle, their souls almost popping out of their eye sockets.",21,RO005TR07
4631,1371,“What is it?” Nhã-loló asked me.,21,RO005TR07
4632,1372,"I signaled to her to be quiet. Then I edged my way through the group, all of whom moved aside without even noticing me. All eyes were fixed on the center. It was a cockfight. I saw the two contenders, two roosters with pointed spurs, fiery eyes, and sharpened beaks. Both of them were shaking their bloodied crests, and their breasts were plucked red-raw; exhaustion was taking its toll. But even so they kept on fighting, eye to eye, beak to beak, blow by blow, quivering with rage. Damasceno was oblivious to everything else; for him the spectacle had wiped out the entire universe. In vain I told him that it was time to move on; he neither replied nor even heard me, so focused was he on the duel. Cockfighting was one of his passions.",21,RO005TR07
4633,1373,"At that moment, Nhã-loló tugged me gently by the arm and said that we should go. I took her advice and the two of us continued our descent. I’ve already mentioned that the hill was uninhabited; I also told you that we were coming from mass, and since I have not said that it was raining, the weather was clearly fine—indeed the sunshine was glorious. And strong too. So strong that I quickly opened my parasol, held it halfway up the shaft, and tilted it in such a way that I was able to add a page to Quincas Borba’s philosophy: Humanitas kissed Humanitas . . . That was how the years rolled off me as I went down the hill.",21,RO005TR07
4634,1374,"We paused for several minutes at the bottom, waiting for Damasceno. He arrived a few minutes later, surrounded by the men who’d been betting on the fight and enthusiastically discussing it with them. One of those men, the “banker,” was distributing a wad of grubby ten-tostão notes, which the winners were doubly happy to receive. As for the roosters, they were carried under the arms of their respective owners. One of them had his crest so badly torn and bloodied that I immediately assumed he was the loser, but I was wrong. The loser was the other one, and he had no crest at all. Both could scarcely breathe, their beaks hanging open in exhaustion. The spectators, on the other hand, sauntered merrily along, despite the strong emotions aroused by the fight. They gave the biographies of the two contenders, and recalled their various exploits. I carried on walking, feeling ashamed. And Nhã-loló? She was very ashamed.",21,RO005TR07

4637,1377,"WHAT SHAMED NHÃ-LOLÓ was her father. The ease with which he had hunkered down with the betting men was a stark reminder of his former habits and social affinities, and Nhã-loló feared that I would think having such a father-in-law demeaning. It was remarkable how much she was changing, by studying herself and studying me. She was drawn to the elegant, refined lifestyle, principally because it seemed to her the surest way of combining our two persons in matrimony. Nhã-loló was constantly observing, imitating, and deciphering; meanwhile, she went to great efforts to mask her family’s inferiority. That day, however, she found the spectacle her father had made of himself mortifying. I therefore sought to distract her by regaling her with jokes and polite witticisms, all of which entirely failed to cheer her up. So deep was her dejection and so evident her despondency that I even began to detect in Nhã-loló a real desire to separate, in my mind, her own cause from her father’s. This struck me as a noble sentiment, and marked yet another affinity between us.",21,RO005TR07

He listened and replied gravely that he had no opinion to give on the affairs of his relatives. People might think he had some special interest in the matter were he to praise Nhã-loló’s rare gifts, and for this reason he kept his counsel. Furthermore, he was sure that his niece nurtured a real passion for me, but if she consulted him, his advice would be negative. He was not motivated by any dislike; he appreciated my good qualities and never tired of praising them, as was only right. And as for Nhã-loló, he could not deny that she would make an excellent bride, but there was an unbridgeable abyss between that and advising marriage.",21,RO005TR07

Now, as for the bride, I cannot have any say on the matter—it is neither my wish nor my place to do so, indeed it would be unworthy of me. I rather think that, from what she’s told me, Sabina overstepped the mark in sharing certain confidences with you, but in any event she is not Nhã-loló’s blood relative, as I am. Look . . . but no . . . I’m not saying . . .”",21,RO005TR07

4647,1387,"Perhaps Cotrim’s scruples will seem excessive to anyone unaware of his ferociously honest character. I myself had been unfair to him during the years that followed our falling-out over my father’s estate. I recognize that he was a model individual. He was often reproached for being stingy, and not without reason; but stinginess is simply the exaggeration of a virtue, and virtues should be like budgets: better to have a surplus than a deficit. His brusque manner brought him many enemies, who even accused him of cruelty.",21,RO005TR07
4648,1388,"The only concrete allegation in that regard was his habit of frequently sending slaves to the calaboose, from where they would emerge dripping with blood. However, in addition to the fact that he only did this with recalcitrants and runaways, one should bear in mind that, having long been involved in smuggling slaves into the country, he had become accustomed to the somewhat harsher treatment required by such a trade, and one cannot honestly attribute to a man’s original nature those aspects that are purely the effect of his position in society.",21,RO005TR07
4649,1389,"Proof of Cotrim’s compassion can be found in his love for his children, and in the grief he suffered when his daughter Sara died a few months later, irrefutable proof, I think, and by no means the only one. He was treasurer of a confraternity and member of various charitable lay brotherhoods, even a redeemed brother of one of them, which isn’t easily reconciled with a reputation for stinginess. It’s true that his good deeds did not go entirely unrewarded: the brotherhood (of which he had served as presiding officer) arranged for a portrait to be painted of him in oils.",21,RO005TR07

4651,1391,"He was not perfect, of course. He had, for example, the habit of informing the newspapers of certain charitable acts he had performed—a reprehensible or unpraiseworthy habit, I agree, but he excused himself on the grounds that good deeds became contagious when rendered public, an argument which one cannot deny has some weight. I even believe (and this surely is the highest possible praise) that he only made these occasional charitable donations with the aim of awakening the philanthropy of others. If such was his objective, then one must concede that publicity was a sine qua non of success. In sum, he may at times have lacked consideration, but he didn’t owe a penny to anyone.",21,RO005TR07

4667,1407,"You can see now to what excesses carelessness can lead; I was somewhat pained by the blindness of the epidemic, which, while cutting a swath through the population, also took away a young lady who was destined to be my wife. I never could understand the need for that epidemic, still less that particular death. Indeed, it struck me as even more absurd than all the other deaths. Quincas Borba, however, explained to me that epidemics were useful to the species, albeit disastrous for certain individuals. He pointed out that no matter how horrific the spectacle may be, there was one advantage of great importance: the survival of the greater number. He went so far as to ask me if, in the midst of everyone’s grief, I did not feel a secret pleasure in having escaped the epidemic’s clutches. It was, however, such a senseless question that it remained unanswered.",21,RO005TR07
4668,1408,"Since I haven’t talked about the death itself, nor will I describe the seventh-day mass. Damasceno was utterly grief-stricken, and the poor man looked a wreck. I went to see him two weeks later, and he was still inconsolable. He told me that the great suffering with which God was punishing him had been made worse by his suffering at the hands of his fellow men. He did not elaborate.",21,RO005TR07
4669,1409,"Three weeks later he returned to the subject, and confessed to me that in the midst of the irreparable catastrophe, he had hoped for consolation in the company of friends. Only twelve people, three-quarters of whom were Cotrim’s friends, had accompanied his beloved daughter’s coffin to her grave. And he had sent out eighty invitations. I suggested that the losses had been so widespread that this could perhaps excuse their apparent discourtesy. Damasceno shook his head sadly and incredulously.",21,RO005TR07

I enjoyed this psychological distinction, and I give thanks for it even now, from the bottom of my grave.",21,RO005TR07
4678,1418,"Indeed, an ordinary man who had heard those words of Damasceno’s would not have remembered them when, some time later, he happened to see an engraving of six Turkish ladies. But I remembered. They were six ladies from Constantinople, modern ladies dressed in street attire. Their faces were covered not by a thick cloth intended to conceal their features completely, but by a very fine veil that pretended to reveal only the eyes, but, in reality, exposed the entire face.",21,RO005TR07
4679,1419,"I found the cleverness of this Muslim coquetry utterly charming; the way it hid the face—in deference to custom—and yet did not hide it—in deference to beauty. At first glance, there is nothing to connect these Turkish ladies with Damasceno; but if you have a profound and penetrating mind (and I very much doubt you will deny that you have), you will understand that in both cases you can glimpse just the tip of the ear of one who has proved to be a stern and tender companion to any man of society . . .",21,RO005TR07

If a grief is assuaged, or a conscience appeased, to whom do we owe this immense benefit, if not to you? The esteem that walks past with its hat on its head says nothing to the soul, but a show of flattering indifference makes a delightful impression. The reason is that, contrary to an absurd old saying, it isn’t the letter that kills; the letter gives life. It’s the spirit that is the object of controversy, doubts, and interpretation, and consequently of life and death. Long may you live, dear sweet Formality, for the sake of Damasceno’s peace of mind, and the glory of Muhammad.",21,RO005TR07

For those who have read this book, there is no need for me to flaunt my satisfaction, and for those who have not it is equally pointless. I was a deputy, and I looked up at the Turkish engraving while leaning back in my chair, between one colleague who was telling a witty anecdote, and another who was sketching the orator’s profile in pencil on the back of an envelope. The orator was Lobo Neves.",21,RO005TR07

If I possessed the necessary apparatus, I would include in this book a page on chemistry, because it would be necessary to break down remorse into its simplest elements in order to know positively and conclusively the reason why Achilles paraded his adversary’s body around the walls of Troy, and why Lady Macbeth paraded her spot of blood around the room. But I have no chemical apparatus, just as I had no feelings of remorse. I did, however, want to be a minister of state. If I am to finish this chapter, though, I will say that I wouldn’t have wanted to be either Achilles or Lady Macbeth, but that if I had to be one of them, I’d rather be Achilles, triumphantly parading a corpse instead of a spot of blood, for then at least I would get to hear Priam’s pitiful pleas at the end, and be rewarded with a fine military and literary reputation.

4690,1430,"THE FIRST TIME I was able to speak to Virgília after her husband’s governorship was at a ball in 1855. She was wearing a superb gown of blue grosgrain, and displayed the same fine pair of shoulders as in former times. She was no longer in the first bloom of youth—quite the contrary—but she was still beautiful, with an autumnal beauty enhanced by the night. I remember that we spoke at length, without alluding to the past at all. Everything went without saying. Perhaps a vague, remote comment or a look, but nothing more. She left shortly afterward; I went to watch her go down the stairs, and I don’t know by what phenomenon of cerebral ventriloquism (I hope the philologists among you will forgive such a barbarous expression), I murmured to myself this profoundly retrospective word:",21,RO005TR07

It was an old friend, a naval officer, a chirpy fellow with somewhat uncouth manners. He smirked and said to me:",21,RO005TR07

4700,1440,"I confess that this conversation was an indiscretion, especially my last reply. And I confess it all the more willingly since it is women who have the reputation for being indiscreet, and I don’t want to finish the book without rectifying this idea. When it comes to amorous adventures, I have known men who would smile or would deny it in an offhand, even monosyllabic way, while their female companions gave nothing away and swore on the Holy Gospel that it was all a vile slander.",21,RO005TR07
4701,1441,"The reason for this difference is that women (save in the case of Chapter CI and certain others) give themselves out of love, either Stendhal’s love-passion or the purely physical kind enjoyed by some Roman ladies, for example, or Polynesians, Laplanders, Hottentots, and possibly other civilized races; but men—and here I am speaking about refined, elegant society men—men hitch their vanity to another sentiment entirely.",21,RO005TR07
4702,1442,"Furthermore (and here I am still referring to cases of infidelity), the woman, when she loves another man, feels that she is betraying her duty, and therefore needs to disguise matters with even greater artifice and ever more refined treachery, whereas the man, sensing that he is the root cause of this transgression and the vanquisher of his rival, feels legitimately proud, and moves on quickly to another sentiment that is less harsh and less secret: that fine fatuousness which is the shimmering sweat of merit.",21,RO005TR07
4703,1443,"But whether or not my explanation is true, suffice it to say, here on this page, for the benefit of posterity, that women’s indiscretion is a joke invented by men; in matters of love, at least, women are as silent as the grave. They often give themselves away through clumsiness or restlessness, or by an inability to control their gestures and expressions, and this is why the queen of Navarre, a great lady and a fine wit, came up with the following metaphor to explain why every amorous intrigue will sooner or later be discovered: “No puppy is so well trained that we will not eventually hear it bark.”********",21,RO005TR07

My interests were best served by keeping silent; confirming the suspicion of an old affair would have simply risked provoking some dormant anger and giving rise to a scandal, or at least acquiring a reputation for indiscretion. Therein lay my true interest, and on the basis of a superficial understanding of Helvétius’s principle, keeping silent is what I should have done. But I have already explained the motivation for male indiscretion: more important than the apparent interest of safety, was another, vanity, which is more immediate and more intimate. The pursuit of safety requires thought and careful consideration, whereas vanity is instinctive and spontaneous, springing straight from the guts. Furthermore, the effect of the former is remote; whereas the latter’s effect is immediate. Conclusion: Helvétius’s principle holds true in my case, but only in respect of my innermost interest, not the apparent one.",21,RO005TR07

It was therefore my life that was going downstairs, or at least the better part of it—a part that had been full of pleasures, excitements, and shocks, cloaked in duplicity and deceit, but certainly the better part, if we take the customary view of things. If, however, we were to choose another more rarefied view, the best part was still to come, as I shall have the honor of telling you in the few remaining pages of this book.",21,RO005TR07
4713,1453,"Fifty years! I hardly needed to tell you. You will already have sensed that my style is not as nimble as it was in the early days. On this occasion, once my conversation with the naval officer was over and he had donned his cape and left, I confess that I felt a little sad. I returned to the ballroom, danced a polka or two, and let myself fall under the spell of the chandeliers, the flowers, the crystal glasses, the pretty eyes, and the faint, light murmurings of private conversations. And I don’t regret it; I felt young again. But half an hour later, at four in the morning when I left the ball, what did I find waiting for me in the back of my carriage? My fifty years. There they were, those stubborn fellows, not yet numb with cold or stiff with rheumatism, but weary and nodding off, ready for bed and a good night’s rest. Then—and here you will see how far a sleepy man’s imagination can travel—I thought I heard a bat hanging from the carriage roof say to me: “Senhor Brás Cubas, your feeling of youthfulness belonged back there in the ballroom, among the crystal glasses, the chandeliers, the silk dresses—it’s the others who are young, not you.”",21,RO005TR07

4716,1456,"AND NOW I FEAR THAT, if a lady reader has got this far, she will shut the book and not read the rest. Her interest in my life has been extinguished, for what interested her was love. Fifty years old! It doesn’t make you an invalid, but you’re certainly not in the first bloom of youth. Ten more years and I will understand what an Englishman here in Rio meant when he said that “it’s a rum business not knowing anyone who remembers my parents, and realizing that I’m eventually going to have to face up to my own utter oblivion.”",21,RO005TR07
4717,1457,"The word is in capital letters: OBLIVION! It is only right that we should bestow all the honors on that worthy but much despised person, that last-minute guest, who is always sure to come. The lady whose light shone so brightly at the dawn of the present emperor’s reign knows it. The same goes, more poignantly, for the lady whose charms bloomed during the Marquis of Paraná’s ministry some twenty years later, for she is closer to her days of triumph, and yet senses that others have already stolen her carriage.",21,RO005TR07
4718,1458,"Then, if she has any self-esteem, she will not persist in trying to awaken dead or dying memories; she will not look for the same admiring glances today as yesterday, for those who set off with her on life’s great journey, glad of soul and swift of foot, were not the same men as today. Tempora mutantur. She understands that this is how the whirlwind has always been, clearing the leaves from the trees and the detritus from the path, without exception and without mercy, and if she has a little philosophy, she pities rather than envies those who have stolen her carriage, because they, too, will soon be set down by the trusty footman oblivion.

4724,1464,"AND YET NOT SO, for it encapsulates the thoughts I shared the following day with Quincas Borba, telling him how downhearted I felt, and many other sad things. But that eminent philosopher, with his fine sense of judgment, told me in no uncertain terms that I was slipping down the deadly slope of melancholy.",21,RO005TR07
4725,1465,"“My dear Brás Cubas, do not let these vapors defeat you. Damnation, sir, you must be a man! Be strong! Fight! Win! Shine! Influence! Dominate! Fifty is the age of wisdom and of government. Cheer up, Brás Cubas; don’t be such a damn fool. What do you care if ruin follows ruin or flower follows flower? Try to relish life, and remember that the very worst philosophy is that of the crybaby who lies down by the riverbank to mourn the incessant flow of the water. The river’s job is never to stop, so reconcile yourself to this eternal law and try to turn it to your advantage.”",21,RO005TR07
4726,1466,"The value of a great philosopher’s authority can be seen in even the smallest things. Quincas Borba’s words had the effect of shaking me out of my moral and mental torpor. So then, to government! It was high time. Until then I hadn’t taken part in any of the great debates. My pursuit of office had been by means of tea and flattery, committees and votes, but office still eluded me. I urgently needed to make a speech.",21,RO005TR07
4727,1467,"I began slowly. Three days later, during a debate on the budget for the ministry of justice, I took the opportunity to inquire modestly of the minister whether he did not think it might be appropriate to reduce the size of the shakos worn by the National Guard. The subject of my question was not of tremendous scope, but even so I demonstrated that it was not unworthy of the reflections of a statesman. I quoted Philopoemen, who had ordered the replacement of his troops’ small round shields with bigger ones, and likewise their lances, which were too light, a fact that history did not appear to think belied the gravity of its pages.",21,RO005TR07
4728,1468,"The dimensions of our shakos called for a substantial reduction, not only for reasons of elegance, but also because they were unhygienic. On parade, in the sun, the excessive heat they produced could be fatal. Since one of Hippocrates’s precepts was to keep a cool head, it seemed cruel to oblige a citizen, simply because of a uniform, to risk his health and life, and consequently the future of his family, by wearing an overelaborate piece of headgear.",21,RO005TR07
4729,1469,"The Chamber and the government should remember that the National Guard was the bulwark of liberty and independence, and that the citizen, called upon to give service that was frequent, arduous, and unpaid, had the right to expect the burden thereof to be reduced by means of a uniform that was practical and light.",21,RO005TR07
4730,1470,,21,RO005TR07
4731,1471,"I added that the shako, by its sheer weight, bowed the heads of our citizens, whereas the nation needed citizens who could hold their heads up proudly and serenely before those in authority. I concluded with this idea: “The weeping willow, whose branches hang down towards the earth, is a tree for cemeteries; the palm tree, erect and firm, is a tree for deserts, squares, and gardens.”",21,RO005TR07
4732,1472,"The reaction to my speech was mixed. As to its form, its eloquent rapture, its literary and philosophical aspects, opinion was unanimous: I was told that it was perfect, and that no one had ever managed to draw so many ideas from a shako. However, many considered its political aspect deplorable, and others even thought my speech a parliamentary disaster. In any event, I was told that some people were convinced I was about to join the opposition, including members of the opposition themselves, who went so far as to hint that now could be an opportune moment for a vote of no confidence.",21,RO005TR07
4733,1473,"I emphatically rejected such an interpretation, which was not only erroneous but slanderous, since my support for the cabinet was a matter of public record. I added that the need to reduce the size of the shako was not so great that it could not wait several years, and that in any event, I would be prepared to compromise on the extent of the cut, contenting myself with three-quarters of an inch or less. In any event, even if my proposal was not adopted, it was enough that I had initiated it.",21,RO005TR07

If, as some suggest, the passion for power is the strongest of all, you can imagine the despair, the pain, the despondency I felt the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies.

He even used a less polite expression, thus showing that the language of philosophy could at times refresh itself with the language of the people. Start a newspaper, he told me, and “bring down the whole cabal.”",21,RO005TR07

4763,1503,"Shortly after this, we came across a dogfight; an event which would have been of no interest to the ordinary man. Quincas Borba made me stop and observe the dogs. There were two of them. He pointed out that near them was a bone, the casus belli, and drew my attention to the fact that there was no meat on the bone. A plain, bare bone. The dogs snapped and growled at each other, with fury in their eyes . . . Quincas Borba tucked his cane under his arm, and seemed in ecstasy.",21,RO005TR07

4765,1505,"I tried to drag him away, but could not; he was rooted to the spot, and only started walking again once the fight was over and one of the dogs, bitten and defeated, took his hunger elsewhere. I noticed that Quincas Borba was genuinely happy, although, as befits a great philosopher, he did not show his feelings. He commented on the beauty of the spectacle, recalled the object of contention, and concluded that the dogs were hungry, but said that a lack of food was of little relevance to the broader effects of philosophy. He took care to recall that in some parts of the world the spectacle is on an even grander scale: human beings are the ones who fight with dogs over bones and other, less appetizing titbits—a fight that becomes much more complicated since it brings into play man’s intelligence, with all the wisdom accumulated over the centuries, etc.",21,RO005TR07

As we walked, I told him that I had some doubts; I was not convinced as to what possible benefit there could be in fighting with dogs over food. He replied in a remarkably mild tone:",21,RO005TR07
4769,1509,"“It’s more logical to fight over food with men, since the contenders share the same characteristics and the stronger of them will get the bone. But why would it not be a grand spectacle to fight over it with dogs? People voluntarily eat locusts, like Saint John the Baptist, or even worse, like Ezekiel. Thus, bad things are edible. It remains to be seen if it is worthier for a man to fight over it out of real need or to prefer that he do so in obedience to some religious exhortation, which is, of course, a mutable feeling, whereas hunger is eternal, just like life and death.”",21,RO005TR07

See what he says on this page.” And, with his hat still on his head and cane still under his arm, he pointed at the passage in question. “What does he say? He says that man has ‘a great advantage over the rest of the world: he knows that he is dying, whereas the universe is entirely unaware of it.’ See? Therefore, the man who fights over a bone with a dog has the great advantage over the latter because he knows he is hungry; and, as I was explaining, it is this that lends grandeur to their struggle.",21,RO005TR07
4779,1519,"‘He knows that he is dying’ is a profound thought, but I nevertheless think that my own formulation is even more profound: ‘He knows that he is hungry.’ Given that the existence of death limits, so to speak, human understanding, the awareness of extinction lasts only for a brief moment and then ends forevermore, whereas hunger has the advantage of returning, and of prolonging the conscious state. It seems to me (if it would not be immodest to say so) that Pascal’s formulation is inferior to mine, although it is still a fine thought, and Pascal a fine man.”",21,RO005TR07

No, I’m lying: she did not so much die as fail to wake up, thus departing this life as secretly as she had entered it. Once again, I asked myself, as I did in Chapter LXXV, whether it was for this, in a moment of great affection, that the cathedral sacristan and the pastry cook had brought Dona Plácida into the world. But I quickly realized that if it hadn’t been for Dona Plácida, my dalliance with Virgília might well have been interrupted, or abruptly broken off, in full flow.

4796,1536,"I HAD TO SET UP THE NEWSPAPER. I wrote its manifesto, which was a political application of Humanitism, except that, since Quincas Borba had not yet published his book (which he was continuing to perfect year upon year), we agreed not to make any reference to the doctrine. Quincas Borba insisted only on a signed, confidential statement saying that some of the new principles applied to politics were drawn from his as-yet-unpublished book.",21,RO005TR07
4797,1537,"It was the crème de la crème of manifestos. It promised to cure society, put an end to abuses, and defend the sound principles of liberty and conservation; it appealed to business and to labor; it quoted Guizot and Ledru-Rollin, and it ended with this threat, which Quincas Borba found petty and parochial: “The new doctrine we espouse will inevitably bring down the current government.” I must confess that given the political circumstances of the time, the manifesto struck me as a masterpiece. As for the threat at the end, which Quincas Borba thought petty, I demonstrated to him that it was steeped in the purest Humanitism, as he himself later admitted.",21,RO005TR07
4798,1538,"Indeed, Humanitism excluded nothing: the Napoleonic wars and a tussle between two goats were both equally sublime, with the sole difference that Napoleon’s soldiers knew they were dying, something which is not apparently the case with goats.

4803,1543,"The following day, Cotrim came to my house. He seemed somewhat out of sorts, but sought to hide it, trying to appear relaxed and even happy. He had read the announcement and felt that, as a relative and a friend, he ought to dissuade me from such an idea. It was a mistake, a fatal mistake. He pointed out that I would be placing myself in a very awkward position, and possibly putting paid to any hopes I might have of a return to Parliament.",21,RO005TR07

He knew several ministers who were very fond of me; a vacancy was not impossible, and— I interrupted him at this point, to tell him that I had thought long and hard about the step I was about to take, and I could not retreat so much as an inch.

Sabina tapped the tips of her fingers with her fan, shook her head, and returned to the fray, alternating pleas and threats. I told her no, no, and no.

4813,1553,"I PUBLISHED MY NEWSPAPER. Twenty-four hours later, a statement issued on behalf of Cotrim appeared in other newspapers saying, in essence, that “while not belonging to any of the political parties between which the nation is divided, he considered it appropriate to make it very clear that he exercised no influence upon, nor played any direct or indirect role in, the newspaper set up by his brother-in-law, Senhor Brás Cubas, whose ideas and political actions he utterly rejected. The current government (or indeed any other government composed of men of similar abilities) seemed to him intent on promoting public well-being.”",21,RO005TR07
4814,1554,"I could hardly believe my eyes. I rubbed them once and then twice, and reread that strange, puzzling, inopportune statement. If he had nothing to do with political parties, why was he so concerned about such a commonplace event as the publication of a newspaper? Not all citizens who think a government good or bad make such statements in the press, nor are they obliged to do so. Cotrim’s intrusion in the matter really was a mystery, as was his personal animosity toward me. Until then our relations had been open and good-natured; I could not recall so much as a hint of discord since our reconciliation.",21,RO005TR07
4815,1555,"On the contrary, my recollections were of genuine favors rendered. During my time as deputy, for example, I was able to obtain for him certain contracts to supply the navy, contracts which he continued to fulfill with the utmost punctiliousness and, as he had told me several weeks earlier, could well earn him two hundred contos over the next three years. Had the memory of so generous a favor not been enough to dissuade him from publicly besmirching his own brother-in-law? The motive behind his statement must have been very strong indeed to lead him to take such an unseemly and ungrateful action. It was, I confess, an insoluble problem.",21,RO005TR07

4821,1561,"“You cannot deny,” he said, “that the benefactor’s pleasure is always greater than the beneficiary’s. After all, what is a good deed? It is an act that brings to an end some deprivation on the part of the beneficiary. Once this essential effect has been produced, i.e., once the deprivation has ceased, the organism reverts to its original state of indifference. Imagine for a moment that the waistband of your pants is too tight; you unbutton the waist, breathe, and savor a moment of pleasure. Then your body returns to its former state of indifference, and you completely forget about the fingers that performed the operation.",21,RO005TR07
4822,1562,"Since nothing lasts forever, it is only natural that memory should fade. Memory is not an aerial plant: it needs soil. The hope of further favors will, of course, always preserve the beneficiary’s recollection of that initial favor, but this fact (incidentally one of the most sublime known to philosophy) is explained by one’s memory of the deprivation, or, put another way, by the deprivation that persists within one’s memory, which brings with it echoes of past suffering and counsels one to resort to the precaution of a convenient remedy. I am not saying that even without such circumstances there might not be occasions when the memory of a good deed does, in fact, persist, accompanied by a greater or lesser degree of affection toward the benefactor; but these are true aberrations with no value whatsoever in the eyes of a philosopher.”",21,RO005TR07
4823,1563,"“But,” I replied, “if there is no reason for the memory of the good deed to persist in the mind of the recipient, there is even less reason for it to persist in the mind of the benefactor. I would be very grateful if you could explain this point.”",21,RO005TR07
4824,1564,"“One cannot explain something that is self-evident,” retorted Quincas Borba. “But I will say one more thing. The persistence of the good deed in the memory of the person who performed the good deed is explained by the very nature of the good deed and its effects. First, there is the sense of having performed a noble action, and, by deduction, an awareness that we are capable of noble actions. Second, one is rewarded with a feeling of superiority vis-à-vis another creature, a superiority both of status and of means. This, according to the best minds, is one of the most legitimate pleasures known to the human organism.",21,RO005TR07
4825,1565,"Erasmus, who wrote some fine things in his treatise In Praise of Folly, drew attention to the pleasure with which two donkeys scratch each other. I have no intention of rejecting Erasmus’s observation, but I will say what he did not, which is that if one of the donkeys scratches better than the other, its eyes will reveal some special mark of satisfaction.",21,RO005TR07
4826,1566,"Why does a pretty woman frequently glance at the mirror if not because she believes herself to be pretty, a belief that gives her a sense of superiority over a multitude of other women who are less pretty or positively ugly? Conscience is just the same; it examines itself often whenever it thinks it looks good. And remorse is nothing more than the scowl of a conscience seeing its own vileness. Always remember that, since everything is simply an emanation of Humanitas, a good deed and its effects are perfectly admirable phenomena.”",21,RO005TR07

The first issue of my newspaper filled my soul with a boundless new dawn, crowned me with laurels, and restored to me the optimism of youth. Six months later, the hour of old age struck, and two weeks after that came death, as surreptitiously as Dona Plácida’s. On the day the newspaper gave up the ghost, I took a deep breath like a man who has come a long way. Indeed, I don’t think it would be entirely absurd of me to say that just as the body feeds its parasites, so human life nourishes other more or less ephemeral lives.",21,RO005TR07
4830,1570,"However, rather than risk this somewhat imprecise and inadequate comparison, I prefer an astronomical metaphor: in his orbit around the great unknown, man performs a double movement of rotation and revolution; he has his days—which are of unequal length like Jupiter’s—and from these he calculates his years, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.",21,RO005TR07

As the funeral procession made its way out, she clung to the coffin in despair; they had to drag her away and take her back inside. Her tears were genuine. I went to the cemetery and, to tell the truth, I could hardly speak; I had a lump in my throat, or perhaps in my conscience. At the cemetery, when I tipped my shovelful of lime onto the coffin at the bottom of the grave, the dull thud of the lime made me shudder; a transient shudder, to be sure, but disagreeable nonetheless.

Virgília had betrayed her husband sincerely, and now she wept for him sincerely. Here was a difficult combination over which I puzzled all the way home. When I arrived at my house, though, just as I was getting out of the carriage, I sensed that it was perfectly possible, even easy. Tender Nature! The tax of grief is like Vespasian’s coin: it does not smell of whence it came and is collected from good and bad alike.

I sometimes enjoyed imagining such contrasts of region, status, and creed. A few days earlier, I had considered the possibility of a social, religious, and political revolution that would turn the archbishop of Canterbury into a humble tax collector in Petrópolis, and I did lengthy calculations to establish whether the tax collector would expel the archbishop or the archbishop dismiss the tax collector, or what proportion of archbishop could be contained in a tax collector, or what amount of tax collector could fit comfortably inside an archbishop, and so on. Insoluble questions apparently, but, in fact, perfectly soluble, since it is only to be expected that there could easily be two archbishops in one—the one named in the papal bull, and the other one.

At first I laughed, but the philosopher spoke with such noble conviction that I felt slightly afraid. The only objection I could make to Quincas Borba’s assertion was that I did not feel crazy, but since that is usually what most crazy people think, such an objection carried no value. Judge for yourselves if there is any basis in the popular belief that philosophers have no time for the little things in life. The following day, Quincas Borba sent an alienist to see me.

4864,1604,"“One could, by analogy,” he said, “attribute the Athenian’s mania to your servant; but analogies are not ideas, nor are they observations drawn from nature. What your servant feels is a noble sentiment perfectly consistent with the laws of Humanitism: it is the pride of being a servant. His intention is to show that he is not the servant of just anybody.”",21,RO005TR07

I cannot describe the effect this revelation had on him; I remember that he trembled and turned very pale.",21,RO005TR07
4870,1610,"It was around this time that I once again made peace with Cotrim, without ever really knowing the cause of our disagreement. It was a timely reconciliation, because solitude was weighing on me, and life, for me, was the most tedious of chores, namely, a chore that involved no work. Shortly afterward, he invited me to join a lay order. I first consulted Quincas Borba.",21,RO005TR07
4871,1611,"“Go ahead, if you wish,” he told me, “but only temporarily, for I am working on adding a dogmatic, liturgical section to my philosophy. Humanitism must also be a religion, the religion of the future, the only true religion. Christianity is good for women and beggars, and the other religions are no better; they all share much the same vulgarity or weakness. The Christian paradise is a worthy rival to the Muslim one, and as for Buddha’s nirvana, well, it’s little more than a paralytic’s dream. As for the Humanistic religion, you will see. The final absorption, the contractive phase, is the reconstitution of substance, not its annihilation, etc. Go wherever you are called, but do not forget that you are my caliph.”",21,RO005TR07

Nothing; I shall say absolutely nothing.",21,RO005TR07

Moreover, the phenomena of one’s own consciousness are difficult to analyze, and if I were to discuss one such phenomenon, I might have to discuss all other related phenomena, and I would end up writing a whole chapter on psychology. I shall merely state that it was the most brilliant phase of my life. The scenes I witnessed were sad; they had the monotony of misfortune, which is just as wearisome as the monotony of pleasure, and perhaps worse. But the pleasure given to the souls of the poor and the sick is a reward worth having. And don’t tell me that its value is purely negative, by virtue of being received only by the object of charity. No, I received it by reflection, and even its reflected value was great enough to give me a really excellent opinion of myself.",21,RO005TR07

And I watched her die on the very same day when, while visiting a slum to distribute alms, I found . . . now, this time you won’t be able to guess. I found Eugênia, the flower of the thicket, the daughter of Dr. Vilaça and Dona Eusébia, just as lame as when I left her, and even sadder.",21,RO005TR07
4877,1617,"On recognizing me, she turned pale and lowered her eyes, but only for an instant. She quickly raised her head and gazed at me with great dignity. I understood that she would not accept alms from my pocket, and I reached out my hand to her as I would to the wife of a wealthy businessman. She nodded, then locked herself in her tiny hovel. I never saw her again; I learned nothing about her life, whether her mother was dead, or what calamity had reduced her to such poverty. I know only that she was still lame and still sad. It was under this deep impression that I arrived at the hospital, where Marcela had been admitted the previous day, and where I watched her expire half an hour later, ugly, thin, and decrepit.",21,RO005TR07

He returned four months later, and entered my house one morning almost in the same state in which I’d seen him in the Passeio Público. The difference lay in his gaze. He had gone mad. He told me that in order to perfect Humanitism, he had burned the entire manuscript and was going to start all over again. The dogmatic section was complete, albeit not written down. It was the true religion of the future.",21,RO005TR07

Quincas Borba was not only mad, he knew he was mad, and this residue of consciousness, like a lantern flickering in the darkness, greatly complicated the horror of his situation. He knew he was mad, but it didn’t bother him; on the contrary, he told me that it was yet further proof of Humanitas, which was simply toying with itself.",21,RO005TR07
4884,1624,"He recited long chapters from the book, along with antiphonies and spiritual litanies; he even performed a sacred dance he had devised for Humanitism’s religious ceremonies. The lugubrious grace with which he lifted and shook his legs was quite fantastical. At other times, he would sulk in a corner, staring into space with eyes in which, very occasionally, there glowed a persistent glimmer of reason, as sad as a tear . . .",21,RO005TR07

The most important of these was the invention of the Brás Cubas Poultice, which died with me when I caught that chill. Divine poultice, you would have given me first place among men, above science and wealth, because you were the genuine and direct inspiration of heaven. Fate decided otherwise and so you, my friends, will remain eternal melancholics.",21,RO005TR07
4889,1629,"This final chapter is all negatives. I did not achieve fame through my poultice; I did not become a government minister, or a caliph; I never married. It is true that, set against these failures, I had the good fortune of not having to buy my daily bread with the sweat of my brow. Furthermore, I did not die the lonely death of Dona Plácida, or suffer the semi-madness of Quincas Borba. Adding all these things up, anyone would think there was neither a shortfall nor a surplus on my final account, and that, consequently, I was quits with life when I departed it. They would be wrong. For on reaching the far side of life’s mystery, I found myself with a small positive balance, which is the final negative in this chapter of negatives: I did not have children, and thus did not bequeath to any creature the legacy of our misery.",21,RO005TR07

4900,10,"​To hear Stendhal confess that he had written one of his books for a hundred readers, is a thing worthy of admiration and disbelief. But it would not be surprising, nor likely to be upsetting, if this book does not get Stendhal’s hundred readers, nor indeed fifty, nor twenty, or even at most ten. Ten? Maybe five. It is, in fact, a diffuse work in which I, Brás Cubas, adopt the free form of a Sterne, or of a Xavier de Maistre, I do not know if I put in a few pessimistic moans. It could be. It’s the work of a dead man. He wrote it with the feather of a dandy dipped in the ink of melancholy, and it is not difficult to foresee what might come out of this conubium. In addition, serious people will find in the book a semblance of pure romance, whereas frivolous people will not find in it the romance they expect; it will earn neither the esteem of the grave nor the love of the frivolous, who are the two highest columns of opinion.",19,RO005TR05
4901,11,"​But I still hope to garner sympathetic readers, and the first thing is to avoid a long, ponderous prologue. The best prologue is the one that contains the fewest things, or the one that says them in an obscure and truncated way. Consequently, I avoid recounting the extraordinary process that I used in the composition of these Memoirs, composed here in the other world. It would be curious, but rather verbose, and unnecessary for understanding the work. The work itself is everything: if you please, fine reader, pay me for the task; If you do not like it, I’ll see you off with a snap of my finger, and goodbye.",19,RO005TR05

4905,15,"For some time I hesitated whether to open these memoirs at the beginning or the end, that is, if I should put my birth or death first. Assuming the vulgar custom is to begin at birth, two considerations led me to adopt a different method: the first is that I am not properly a deceased author, but a late author, for whom the grave is another cradle; the second is that the writing will thus be more dashing and novel. Moses, who also related his death, did not put it at the start but at the end; a radical difference between this book and the Pentateuch.",19,RO005TR05
4906,16,"​Having said this, I expired at two o’clock on the evening on a Friday in the month of August, 1869, in my beautiful farm at Catumbi. I was about sixty-four years old, hardy and prosperous, single, possessing about three hundred contos, and was accompanied to the cemetery by eleven friends. Eleven friends! True, there were no letters or announcements. In addition, it was raining - a gentle rain, sad and constant, so constant and so sad that one of the faithful attendants of my last hour interposed this ingenious idea into the discourse he uttered at the edge of my grave:",19,RO005TR05

4908,18,"​Good and faithful friend! No, I do not regret the twenty bonds I left him. And this is how I came to the close of my days; it was thus that I made my way to Hamlet’s undiscovered country, without the anxieties or doubts of the young prince, but slow and wobbly, as one who retires late from the theatre. Late and bored. I saw about nine or ten people, including three ladies, my sister Sabina, married to Cotrim, their daughter, a lily of the valley, and ... Be patient! I’ll tell you who the third lady was.",19,RO005TR05
4909,19,"Be content to know that this anonymous woman, though she is not a relative, suffered more than my kinsfolk. It’s true, she suffered more. I won’t say that she cried, I won’t say that she rolled on the floor, convulsed. I won’t claim that my death was high drama... A bachelor who expires at the age of sixty-four does not seem to gather together all the elements of a tragedy. And so, yes, the least fitting thing this anonymous woman could do was to make a show of it.

I swear to you that this orchestra of death was far less sad than it might seem. From a certain point on, it came to be delicious. Life rattled in my chest, and with a wave of waves, my consciousness was gone, I descended into physical and moral immobility, and my body became a plant, a stone, mud, nothing at all…",19,RO005TR05

Once she got hold, she began to brace herself, to put out her leg, and to make the most daring feats of tight-rope-walking, which it is possible to believe. I let myself contemplate her. Suddenly she took a great leap, stretched out her arms and legs, until she formed an X: decipher me or I devour you.",19,RO005TR05

4918,28,"But now that I’m here on the other side of life, I can confess everything: what influenced me particularly was my desire to see printed in the newspapers, on posters, leaflets, street corners, and finally on the boxes of the medicine these three words: Brás Cubas Plaster. Why deny it? I had a passion for fame, publicity, fireworks. Perhaps the modest will argue against this defect; but the talented will appreciate it.",19,RO005TR05
4919,29,"​So, my idea had two faces, as medals do, one facing the public, another facing me. On the one hand, philanthropy and profit; on the other hand, a desire for position. Let’s say it: a love of glory.",19,RO005TR05
4920,30,"An uncle of mine, the canon of a whole prebend, used to say that the love of temporal glory was the perdition of souls, who should only covet eternal glory.

He was a cooper by craft, a native of Rio de Janeiro, where he would have died in poverty and obscurity, if he had stuck to cooperage. But no; he became a farmer, planted, harvested, swapped his produce for good honest money, until he died, leaving a thick inheritance to his son, Licentiate Luis Cubas.",19,RO005TR05

4927,37,"​As this name of Cubas demeaned him, my father, the great-grandson of Damião, claimed that the name had been given to a knight, a hero of the African campaigns, as prize for the feat of snatching three hundred vats from the Moors. My father was a man of imagination; he escaped the cooperage on the wings of a wordplay. He was a good character, my father, a man worthy and loyal as few are. This was all, in fact, a puff of smoke; but who in this world is entirely honest?",19,RO005TR05
4928,38,"It is noteworthy that he resorted to such inventiveness only after a touch of forgery; first of all, he attached himself to the family of my famous namesake, the captain-general Brás Cubas, who founded the town of São Vicente, where he died in 1592, and for that reason he gave me the name Brás. But the family of the captain-major turned him away, and it was then that he dreamed up the three hundred Moorish vats.",19,RO005TR05

4932,42,"​My idea, after so many false starts, had become fixed in my mind. God forbid, reader, an idée fixe; better a mote, a stud in the eye. Look at Cavour; it was the fixed idea of ​​Italian unity that killed him. It is true that Bismarck did not die the same way; but it should be noted that nature is capricious and history an eternal laurel. ​For example, Suetonius gave us a Claudius who was a simpleton - or “a pumpkin” as he was called by Seneca, and a Titus, who deserved to be the darling of Rome.",19,RO005TR05
4933,43,"A professor came along and found a way to show that the delicious, truly wondrous Caesar was this “pumpkin” of Seneca. And you, Madame Lucrecia, flower of the Borgias, though a poet painted you as the Catholic Messalina, there came along an unbelieving Gregorovius who erased this quality from you, and, if you did not emerge a lily, you also did not stay in the swamp. I let myself stand between the poet and the sage.",19,RO005TR05

It was two years since we had seen each other, and I saw her now, not what she was, but what she had been, as we both had been, because a mysterious Hezekiah had made the sun turn back to our youthful days.

Virgília now had the beauty of old age, an austere and maternal air; I was less thin than when I saw her for the last time at a St. John’s Eve in Tijuca; and because she was one of those who put up a fight against everything, only now the dark hair had begun to be interwoven with some threads of silver.",19,RO005TR05

4952,62,"“So you’re dead then!” said Virgília with a pout. And after squeezing my hands, “I want to see if I can find some stray souls to put out onto the street.”",19,RO005TR05
4953,63,"It was not the tearful caress of another time; but the voice was friendly and sweet. She sat down. I was alone at home with a simple nurse; we could talk to each other, without danger. Virgília gave me much news from the outside, narrating it with grace, salting it mischievously with some bad language; I, about to leave the world, felt a satanic pleasure in mocking it all, in persuading myself that I did not leave anything worth leaving.",19,RO005TR05
4954,64,"​“What ideas are these!” Virgília interrupted me, a little angry. “See if I come back here. Die! All of us will die; we just have to work at being alive.”",19,RO005TR05

4963,73,"“I am old! No one notices me. But to mitigate it, I will come with Nhonhô.”",19,RO005TR05
4964,74,"Nhonhô was a bachelor, the only son of her marriage, who, at the age of five, had been an unwitting accomplice to our love. They came together two days later, and I confess that when I saw them there in my bedroom, I was overcome by a bashfulness that did not even allow me to respond to the boy’s kind words. Virgília guessed it and said to her son,",19,RO005TR05
4965,75,"“Nhonhô, pay no notice of this great sly man who is here; he is silent to make you believe that he is dead.”",19,RO005TR05
4966,76,"Her son smiled, I think she smiled too, and everything ended in pure whimsy. Virgília was serene and smiling, she had the appearance of immaculate life. No suspicious looks, no gestures that could denounce anything; an equality of word and spirit, a domination over herself, which seemed and perhaps were rare. When we stumbled into talking of an illegitimate love, half-secret, half-divulged, I saw her speak with disdain and a little indignation of the woman in question, her friend. The son was satisfied, hearing those words, dignified and strong, and I asked myself what the hawks would say if Buffon had been born a hawk ...",19,RO005TR05

4970,80,"I am told, no one has yet reported his own delirium; I do it, and science will thank me. If the reader is not given to the contemplation of these mental phenomena, he can skip the chapter; go straight to the narration. But, odd as it all sounds, I’ll tell you that it’s interesting to know what went on in my head for these twenty to thirty minutes.",19,RO005TR05
4971,81,"At first, I took on the figure of a Chinese barber, bulky, right-handed, shaving Mandarins, who paid me for the work with pinches and confections: Mandarin whims.",19,RO005TR05
4972,82,"Soon after, I felt myself transformed into the Summa Theologica of St. Thomas, printed in a single volume, and bound in morocco, with silver clasps and prints; This idea left me completely immobile; and now I remember that, since my hands were the clasps of the book, and I crossed them over my belly, someone undid them (Virgília certainly), because the pose gave me the appearance of a deceased person.",19,RO005TR05
4973,83,"Finally, restored to human form, I saw a hippopotamus arrive, which snatched me up. I let myself go, silent, I do not know if out of fear or confidence; but soon his course became so dizzying that I challenged him, and delicately told him that the journey seemed to me to be without a destination.",19,RO005TR05
4974,84,"“You are mistaken,” said the beast, “we go to the origin of the centuries.”",19,RO005TR05
4975,85,"I insisted that this must be very far away; but the hippopotamus did not understand me or did not hear me, or he pretended he couldn’t; and when I asked whether he was a descendant of the horse of Achilles, or of Balaam’s ass, he answered me, as he spoke, with a gesture peculiar to these four-legged creatures: he shook his ears. For my part I closed my eyes and let myself go.",19,RO005TR05
4976,86,"I cannot deny that I felt a tickle of curiosity, to know where the origin of the centuries lay, whether it was as mysterious as the origin of the Nile, and especially if it was worth more or less than the consummation of the same centuries: a diseased brain’s reflections. Because I kept my eyes closed, I could not see the way; I only remember that the sensation of cold increased with the journey, and that at one point we seemed to enter the region of the eternal ice.",19,RO005TR05
4977,87,"In fact, I opened my eyes and saw that my animal was galloping across a white snowy plain dotted with snowy mountains, snowy vegetation, and several large, snowy animals. All snow; a snowy sun froze us from above. I tried to speak, but I could only spit out this anxious question:",19,RO005TR05

4981,91,“But we’re going backwards!” he reproached me.,19,RO005TR05
4982,92,"I was vexed and stunned. The journey seemed to me tedious and extravagant, the cold uncomfortable, the ride violent, and the result impalpable. And then - the thoughts of the diseased - as we arrived at the appointed destination, it was not impossible that the centuries, irritated by the loss of their origin, would crush me between the fingernails which were as ancient as they were.",19,RO005TR05
4983,93,"While I was thinking this, we were devouring the road, and the plains flew by under our feet, until the animal stopped, and I could look more calmly around me. As I looked around I saw nothing, besides the immense whiteness of the snow, which suddenly had invaded the sky itself, blue up till now. Perhaps, in the open spaces, there appeared to me some plant or other, enormous, brutish, waving its broad leaves in the wind. The silence of that place was like that of the tomb: it could be said that the life of things had been mute before man arrived.",19,RO005TR05
4984,94,"Did it fall from the air? stand up from the earth? I do not know; I know that an immense figure, a figure of woman, appeared to me, looking at me, eyes glittering like the sun. Everything in this figure had the vastness of the jungle’s forms, and everything escaped the grasp of a human gaze, because the contours were lost in the environment, and what seemed thick was often diaphanous. Astonished, I said nothing, I did not even utter a cry; but after a while, which was brief, I asked who she was and what her name was: curiosity born of delirium.",19,RO005TR05
4985,95,“Call me Nature or Pandora; I am your mother and your enemy.”,19,RO005TR05
4986,96,"At that last word, I backed away a little, startled. The figure let out a laugh, which produced around us the effect of a typhoon; the plants twisted and a long groan broke the silence of the external things.",19,RO005TR05

You live: now that you go mad, you live; and if your conscience regains an instant of wit, you will say that you want to live.”",19,RO005TR05
4990,100,"Saying this, the vision stretched out its arm, took hold of my hair and lifted me up like a feather. Only then, I could see her face, which was huge. Nothing more serene; no violent contortion, no expression of hatred or ferocity; the sole, general, complete expression was that of selfish impassivity, that of eternal deafness, that of a rigid will. Feelings of rage, if she had them, were locked away in her heart. At the same time, in this face with its glacial expression, there was an air of youth, a mixture of strength and luster, before which I felt the weakest and decrepit of beings.",19,RO005TR05
4991,101,"“Did you understand me?” she asked, after some moments of mutual contemplation.",19,RO005TR05

I am dreaming, surely, or, if it is true that I have gone mad, you are but a conception of the madman, that is, a vain thing, which absent reason cannot rule or touch. Nature, you? the Nature that I know is only a mother and not an enemy; it does not make life a scourge, nor, like you, have such an indifferent face, like the grave. And why Pandora?”",19,RO005TR05

4996,106,"This word echoed like thunder in that great valley, and it seemed to me that it was the last sound that came to my ears; I seemed to feel the sudden decomposition of myself. Then I looked at her with pleading eyes, and asked for a few more years.",19,RO005TR05
4997,107,"​ “Pathetic minute!” she exclaimed. “What do you want with a few more moments of life? To devour and be devoured later? Are you not fed up with the show and the fight? You know of everything I have to offer that is not too ridiculous or too distressing: the dawn of the day, the melancholy of the afternoon, the quiet of the night, the look of the earth, sleep, in short, the greatest works of my hands. What more do you want, sublime idiot?”",19,RO005TR05
4998,108,"​ “Life alone, I do not ask for anything else. Who has put this love of my life in my heart, if not you? and if I love life, why should you wound yourself and kill me?",19,RO005TR05

The next minute is strong, joyful, it presumes to bring in eternity, and brings death, and perishes like the last one, but time subsists. Selfishness, you say? Yes, selfishness, I have no other law. Selfishness, conservation. The jaguar kills the bull because the jaguar’s reasoning is that it must live, and if the bull is tender so much the better: this is the universal law. Go up and see for yourself.”",19,RO005TR05
5000,110,"With that, she carried me up a mountain. I inclined my eyes to one of the slopes, and I contemplated, for a long time, in the distance, through a fog, a unique thing. Imagine yourself, reader, a reduction of the ages, and a parade of them all, all races, all the passions, the tumult of empires, the war of appetites and hatred, the reciprocal destruction of beings and things. Such was the spectacle, the bitter and curious spectacle.",19,RO005TR05
5001,111,"The history of man and earth was so intense that neither imagination nor science could render it, because science is slower and imagination more vague, whereas what I saw there was the living condensation of all time. To describe it one would have to freeze the lightning bolt. The centuries passed in a whirlwind, and yet, because the eyes of delirium are different, I saw everything that passed before me, - scourges and delights, - from the thing called glory to that which is called misery, and saw love multiplying misery, and saw misery aggravating weakness.",19,RO005TR05
5002,112,"Here came the greed that devours, the anger that ignites, the envy that drools, and the hoe and the feather, wet with sweat, and ambition, hunger, vanity, melancholy, wealth, love, and all shook man, like a rattle, and destroying him, like a rag. They were various forms of an evil that now tore at his entrails, sometimes gnawed at his thoughts, and walked ever in her Harlequin garments around the human species. The pain ceased sometimes, but gave way to indifference, which was a dreamless sleep, or to pleasure, which was a bastard pain.",19,RO005TR05
5003,113,"Then man, scourged and rebellious, ran before the fatality of things, behind a nebulous and elusive figure, made of scraps, a flap of the impalpable, another of the improbable, another of the invisible, sewn all to the precarious point, with the needle of the imagination; and this figure, - no less than the chimera of happiness, - either fled perpetually, or let itself be trapped by the hem, and man clung to its breast, and then she laughed in mockery, and disappeared as an illusion.",19,RO005TR05
5004,114,"In contemplating such calamity, I could not keep in a cry of anguish, which Nature or Pandora listened to without protest or laughter; and I do not know by what law of cerebral disorder, that I should laugh, - an idiotic laugh.",19,RO005TR05
5005,115,"“You’re right,” I said, “it’s fun and it’s worth it, - it may be monotonous - but it’s worth it. When Job cursed the day he was conceived, it was because he wanted to see the spectacle from above. Come on, Pandora, open your belly, and digest me; This thing is amusing, but digest me.”",19,RO005TR05
5006,116,"Her answer was to compel me brusquely to look down, and to see the centuries that continued to pass, swift and turbulent, generations overlapping generations, some sad, like the Hebrews in captivity, others happy, as the debaucheries of Commodus, and all of them punctual for the grave. I wanted to escape, but a mysterious force held my feet; Then she said to me, “Well, the centuries are passing, my age will come, and it will also pass, to the last, which will give me the secret of eternity.”",19,RO005TR05
5007,117,"And I fixed my eyes, and continued to see the ages coming and passing, and I was calm and resolute, I do not even know how happy I was. Maybe quite cheerful.

5008,118,"While life thus had a calendar’s regularity, history and civilization were made, and man, naked and unarmed, armed himself and dressed, constructed the tegurium and the palace, the rough village and Thebes of a Thousand Gates, made himself a mechanic, a philosopher, covered the face of the globe, descended to the womb of the earth, ascended to the sphere of the clouds, thus collaborating in the mysterious work, in which he contemplated the necessity of life and the melancholy of helplessness.",19,RO005TR05
5009,119,"My glance, annoyed and distracted, finally saw the coming of the present century, and behind it the future. It was agile, right-handed, vibrant, full of itself, a little diffuse, audacious, knowing, but at the end as miserable as the first, and so it passed and so passed the others, with the same rapidity and equal monotony. I focused my attention; I looked at it; I would finally see the last, the last! but then the speed of the march was such that it escaped all understanding; at its base the lightning would be a century.",19,RO005TR05

It’s quite a trick; you won’t get her out of there; she’s long past shaming. Now, if we notice in the immense number of houses she occupies, at one time or another during their calmer seasons, we will conclude that this lovely pilgrim is the terror of house-owners. In our case, there was almost a disturbance at the door of my brain, because the intruder did not want to give up the house, and the lady did not give up her intention of taking what was her own. After all, Nonsense was content with a corner in the attic.",19,RO005TR05

You see, my delirium began in the presence of Virgília; Virgília was my great sin of youth; there is no youth without childhood; childhood supposes birth; and here is how we arrived, effortlessly, on October 20, 1805, when I was born. Did you see? No apparent transition, nothing that distracts the reader’s leisurely attention: nothing.",19,RO005TR05

That this method, being, as it is, an indispensable thing, yet it is better to have it without a tie and suspenders, but a little fresh and loose, as if one does not care about the neighbour or the local policeman.

I was born; I was received in the arms of Pascoela, a distinguished midwife, who boasted that she had opened the door of the world to a whole generation of gentlemen. It is not impossible that my father should have heard this statement; I do not think, however, that the paternal feeling induced him to gratify her with two coins. Washed and bandaged, I was the hero of our house. Everyone prophesied to me what suited them best. My uncle John, the former infantry officer, saw in me a certain look of Bonaparte, which my father could not hear without nausea; my uncle Ildefonso, then a simple priest, sniffed a canon in me.",19,RO005TR05

Both descended from old families from the north and truly honored the blood that flowed in their veins, once shed in the war against Holland. I notice that the names of both were the first things I learned; and I certainly said them with much grace, or revealed some precocious talent, because there was no stranger before whom I was not obliged to recite them.",19,RO005TR05

My mother taught me in her own way, made me learn some precepts and prayers; but I felt that, more than prayers, my nerves and blood governed me, and the Golden Rule lost the spirit, which gave it life, and became a vain formula. In the morning, before the porridge, and at night, before bed, I asked God to forgive me, just as I forgave my debtors; but between morning and night I did great wickedness, and my father, after the uproar, poked me in the face and exclaimed with a laugh: “Ah!

He did not respect adolescence, as he did not respect my brother’s cassock; with the difference that the canon ran away as soon as he came across a rough subject. I did not; I stayed, without understanding anything at first, then understanding and finally finding it amusing.

The black women, with loincloths over their wombs, rolled up a few of their dresses, some inside the tank, others outside, leaning over the clothes, beating, waxing, twisting, listening and reprimanding the pranks of Uncle João, and commenting from time to time with this word:",19,RO005TR05

He did not just offer one gloss, but three; I swore to the gods it would not end.

I asked for the sweet in a low voice; I cried, I screamed, I stamped my feet. My father, who would have given me the sun, if I demanded it, called a slave to serve me the candy; but it was late.

The maid brought it to her, in a silver bowl, a proceed of my eleven contos. Marcela politely offered me the refreshment; my answer was to strike the glass and tray with my hand. As the liquid spilled in her lap, the black woman screamed, I cried to her to leave. Being alone, I poured out all the despair of my heart; I told her that she was a monster, who had never had love for me, who had allowed me to abase myself, without at least the excuse of sincerity; I called her many ugly names, made many wild gestures.",19,RO005TR05
5151,261,"Marcela sat down, clawing at her teeth, cold as a piece of marble. I had the urge to strangle her; to humiliate her at least, subjugate her at my feet. Maybe I was going to do it; but the action was changed into another; it was I who threw myself at her feet, contrite and supplicating; I kissed them, I remembered those months of our solitary happiness, I repeated to her the dear names of another time, sitting on the floor, with my head between her knees, squeezing her hands over and over; gasping for breath, I begged her with tears not to forsake me...

I was happy. It is true that the diamonds corrupted my happiness a little; but it is no less certain that a beautiful lady may well love both the Greeks and their gifts. And I trusted my good Marcela; she could have flaws, but she loved me ...",19,RO005TR05

I saw you there running after the vizier’s wife, along the gallery, she tempting you with possession, and you running, running, running, down the long alley, till you went out into the street, where all the saddlers sucked you in and spat you out.",19,RO005TR05
5178,288,"Then it seemed to me that Marcela’s corridor was the avenue, and that the street was that of Baghdad. In fact, looking at the door, I saw on the sidewalk three of the saddlers, one in a cassock, one in livery, the other in civilian clothes, all three of whom entered the corridor, took me by the arms, my father on the right, my uncle the canon on the left, the one with the livery driving, and I was taken to the house of the police chief, where I was transported to a galley that was on its way to Lisbon. Imagine how I resisted; but all resistance was useless.",19,RO005TR05

When he could not be with me, he would take me to his wife. The woman was almost always on a shallow couch, coughing a lot, and assuring me that she was going to show me around Lisbon. She was not thin, she was transparent; it was impossible that she would not die at any moment. The captain pretended not to believe in her impending death, perhaps deceiving himself. I did not know or think anything. What did I care about the fate of a physical woman in the middle of the ocean? The world for me was Marcela.",19,RO005TR05

After a few seconds, he took my hand and pointed at the moon, and asked why I did not do an ode to the night; I told him I was not a poet. The captain growled something, took two steps, reached into his pocket, took out a piece of paper, very crumpled; then, in the light of a flashlight, he read a Horacian ode on the freedom of maritime life. They were his verses.",19,RO005TR05
5188,298,“Well?”,19,RO005TR05
5189,299,"I do not remember what I told him; I remember that he shook my hand with great force and many thanks; then he recited to me two sonnets; he was about to recite another, when they called him on behalf of his wife.",19,RO005TR05

The next day, we woke up in a thunderstorm, which frightened everyone, except the madman; he started to jump, to say that his daughter was coming to fetch him; the death of his daughter was the cause of his madness. No, I shall never forget the hideous figure of the poor man in the midst of the tumult of the people and the howling of the hurricane, humming and dancing, his eyes leaping out of his face, pale, his hair long and shaking.",19,RO005TR05
5192,302,"Sometimes he would stop, raise his bony hands in the air, make crosses with his fingers, then a checkerboard, then some rings, and he would laugh loudly, desperately. His wife could no longer take care of him; delivered over to the terror of death, she prayed for herself to all the saints in heaven. At last, the storm subsided. I confess it was an excellent diversion from the storm of my heart. I, who was contemplating death, did not dare look at it when it came to me.",19,RO005TR05
5193,303,"The captain asked me if I had been afraid, if I had felt at risk, if I had not found the spectacle sublime: all this with a friend’s interest.

5194,304,"“You will see,” he replied.",19,RO005TR05
5195,305,"And he recited to me one little poem, then another, an eclogue, and finally five sonnets, with which he ended his literary confidences that day. The next day, before saying anything to me, the captain explained that he had only for very important reasons embraced the maritime profession, because his grandmother had wanted him to be a priest, and indeed he had some Latin letters; he did not become a priest, but he did not cease to be a poet, which was his natural vocation.",19,RO005TR05
5196,306,"To prove it, he recited to me, on the spot, a hundred verses. I noticed one phenomenon: the gestures he used were such, that they once made me laugh; but the captain, when he recited, drew so far within himself, that he neither saw nor heard.",19,RO005TR05
5197,307,"The days passed away, and the waters, and the verses, and with them his wife’s life also passed away. It was close. One day, shortly after lunch, the captain told me that the patient might not see the end of the week.",19,RO005TR05

I left her, dismayed; I arrived to find her husband looking at the waves, which came to die on the side of the ship, and I tried to comfort him; he thanked me, told me the story of his love, praised the faithfulness and dedication of the woman, recalled the verses he gave her, and recited. At this point they came to get him; we both ran; it was the crisis. This and the next day were cruel; the third brought death; I fled the spectacle, I was disgusted. Half an hour later I found the captain sitting on a bundle of cables, his head in his hands; I offered him some words of comfort.",19,RO005TR05
5201,311,"“She died a saint,” he answered. and so that these words could not be seen as weakness, he rose quickly, shook his head, and looked at the horizon with a long, penetrating gaze. “Come,” he went on, “let us deliver her to the pit that never opens again.”",19,RO005TR05
5202,312,"In fact, a few hours later, the corpse was thrown into the sea, with the usual ceremonies. Sorrow had withered all the faces; the widower’s face was the expression of a hill severely blasted by a lightning bolt. Great silence. The wave opened its belly, received the spoil, closed, - a slight wrinkle, - and the galley moved on. I lingered a few minutes after, with my eyes on that uncertain spot in the sea where one of us now rested ... I went to see the captain to distract him.",19,RO005TR05
5203,313,"“Thank you,” he said, understanding my intention; “believe that I will never forget your good services. God is going to repay them. Poor Leocadia! Remember us in heaven.”",19,RO005TR05
5204,314,"He wiped away a tear with his sleeve; I sought a distraction in poetry, which was his passion. I told him about the verses he had read me, and I offered to print them. The captain’s eyes brightened a little.",19,RO005TR05
5205,315,"“Perhaps they will take them,” he said. “but I do not know ... they are very loose verses.”",19,RO005TR05

5208,318,"The next day he came to read me a fresh elegy he had composed, which recorded the circumstances of the death and the burial of his wife; He read it in a voice that was very moving, and his hand trembled; at the end he asked me if the verses were worthy of the treasure he had lost.",19,RO005TR05

A great future? Maybe a naturalist, a literati, an archaeologist, a banker, a politician or even a bishop, - a bishop it was, - since it meant a position, a preeminence, a great reputation, a superior status. Ambition, since it is an eagle, cracked the egg on that occasion, and unveiled the bright, penetrating eye inside. Goodbye, sweetheart! Goodbye, Marcela! days of delirium, jewels without price, life without regimen, goodbye. I go to fatigue and to glory; I leave you with the short pants of my first age.",19,RO005TR05

The university met me with its arduous curriculum; I was a poor study, but I did not fail to gain my bachelors degree; in solemn style, after the custom of the law; a beautiful party that filled me with pride and longing, - especially longing for home. I had conquered in Coimbra as a carouser; I was a flippant, superficial, tumultuous, petulant scholar given to adventures, a romantic in practice and a liberal in theory, living with the pure faith of black eyes and written constitutions.",19,RO005TR05
5219,329,"On the day that the university certified on parchment my mastery of a science that was far from rooted in my brain, I confess that I felt somehow robbed, though I was proud.

I put that badly: he tried to bolt, and he actually took two leaps, but a mule-driver, who was there, came in time to catch the rein and stop him, not without effort or risk.

The mule-driver had saved my life; I knew it; I felt it in the blood that stirred my heart. Good mule-driver! As I examined myself, he was careful to repair the donkey’s harness with great zeal and art. I decided to give him three gold coins of the five I brought with me; not because it was the price of my life, - that was invaluable; but because it was a reward worthy of the dedication with which he saved me.

I took it out, saw it glitter in the sunlight; the mule-driver did not see it, because I had turned my back to him; but he suspected something perhaps. He went on speaking to the donkey in a meaningful way; gave him advice, told him to take his advice, that the “doctor” could punish him; a paternal monologue. God damn it!

She came out, modest and black, spreading her wings, under the vast dome of a blue sky, which is always blue, for all the wings that may fly there.",19,RO005TR05

I suppose she would never have seen a man; she did not know what man was; she flew endless laps around my body, and saw that I moved, that had eyes, arms, legs, a divine air, a colossal stature. Then she said to herself, “This is probably the inventor of butterflies.”",19,RO005TR05
5366,476,"The idea overwhelmed her, terrified her; but the fear, which is also suggestive, implied that the best way to please her creator was to kiss him on the forehead and so she kissed me on the forehead.

5367,477,"​A blow of a towel ended the adventure. It was nothing to her the blue immensity, or the joy of the flowers, or the pomp of the green leaves, against a face towel, two sticks of raw linen. See how good it is to be superior to butterflies! Because, it’s fair to say, if it were blue or orange, its life would have been no more secure; it was not impossible for me to pierce it with a pin, for the pleasure of my eyes. It was not. This last idea consoled me again; I pinched my big finger to my thumb, I said goodbye, and the corpse fell into the garden. It was time; here were the provident ants coming ...

Perhaps it was to cover up the defect; but why did she confess it now? I looked at her and noticed that she was sad.",19,RO005TR05

This contrast would make one suspect that nature is sometimes a great scorn. Why beautiful, if a cripple? Why a cripple, if she’s pretty? Such was the question I had been asking myself when I returned home at night, not knowing the solution to the riddle. The best solution, if you cannot solve a riddle, is to shake it out the window; That’s what I did; I reached for a towel and shook off that other black butterfly, which was fluttering in my brain. I was relieved and went to sleep. But dreams, which are a cleaving of the mind, let the beast enter again, and I lay there all night digging into the mystery without solving it.",19,RO005TR05

To be haunted is a way to enhance style; there was no rapture, but pleasure, a certain physical and moral satisfaction. I wanted her, it’s true; next to this simple creature, spurious and misshapen daughter, made by love and contempt, I felt good, and she felt still better next to me. And this in Tijuca.

Poor Eugenia! If only you knew what ideas wandered through my mind at that time!

In her alcove was an oratorio of rosewood, hand carved, three palms high, with three images inside; but she did not tell her friends about it; on the contrary, she saw those who were religious only as beatified.

The brown denim trousers had two strong knee pads, while the cuffs were gnawed by the heel of a boot without mercy or polish.

5705,815,"​ I told her no. The world was very vast, and I had the means to live wherever there was pure air and strong sun; he would never make it so far; only great passions are capable of great deeds, and he did not love her enough to find her if she were so far away. Virgília made a gesture of astonishment and perhaps indignation; she murmured that her husband was very fond of her.",19,RO005TR05
5706,816,"“It may be,” I replied; “He might well ...”",19,RO005TR05
5707,817,"I went to the window, and began to drum my fingers on the sill. Virgília called to me; I stood there, letting my jealousy rise, the desire to strangle the husband, if I had him there at hand ... Just at that moment, Lobo Neves appeared in the house. Do not tremble like that, pale reader; Rest easy, I will not stain this page with a drop of blood. As soon as he appeared in the yard, I made a friendly gesture, accompanied by a gracious word; Virgília hurriedly left the room, where he entered three minutes later.",19,RO005TR05

5724,834,"At dinner I proved him wrong; I drank more than usual; though not enough to lose my reason. I was already worked up, and I stayed fairly late. This was the first great anger I felt against Virgília. I did not look at her once during dinner; I spoke of politics, of the press, of the ministry, I believe that I would have spoken of theology, if I knew any, or if I remembered any. Lobo Neves engaged me with great placidity and dignity, and even with a certain superior benevolence; and this irritated me too, and it made the dinner longer and more bitter.

I checked the clock, I wanted to get dressed, and to go to the show. But I thought I would be late; it would show weakness. Of course, Virgília was starting to get bored with me, I thought. And this idea made me successively desperate and cold, willing to forget her and kill her.",19,RO005TR05
5731,841,"I could see her from where I was, reclining in her box, with her magnificent bare arms, - the arms that were mine, mine alone - captivating everyone’s gaze, with the superb dress she had to have, her milk bosom, her hair in curls, in the fashion of the time, and the jewels, less glittering than her eyes ... I saw her like this, and it hurt me that others saw her too. Then I began to undress her, to put aside the jewels and silks, to dishevel her with my lusty, lusty hands, to make her, - I do not know if she was more beautiful, or more natural, - to make her mine, mine alone, mine alone.",19,RO005TR05

5739,849,"I did not have the courage to argue, and, by the way, to argue about what? It was not her fault that her husband loved her. I told her that she had done nothing to me, that I was necessarily jealous of the other man, that I could no longer bear him with a cheerful smile; I added that there might be a lot of dissimulation in him, and that the best way to close the door to fear and dissension was to accept my idea of ​​the day before.",19,RO005TR05
5740,850,"“I thought of that,” said Virgília; “a lonely house, alone, in a garden, in some hidden street, is that not it? I didn’t mind the idea; but why escape?”",19,RO005TR05

5745,855,"Virgília burst into tears, and in order not to attract attention, she put her handkerchief in her mouth and repressed her sobs; how that rattled me. If anyone heard it, everything was lost.

Do you like Candiani? No surprise. You are all the same. The Baron said yesterday, in the box, that one Italian is worth five Brazilians. What a scandal! And the impertinence of an old man, which is worse. But why did not you go to the theatre yesterday?”",19,RO005TR05

5763,873,"When I got to the street, I regretted that I had left. The baroness was one of the people who most distrusted us. She was fifty-five, but looked forty, soft, gay, still with traces of her beauty, fine bearing, elegant manners. She did not talk much, not usually; she possessed the great art of listening to others, spying on them; She would recline in her chair, with an intense, acute gaze, and let herself be.",19,RO005TR05
5764,874,"The others, not noticing what was happening, spoke, looked around, gesticulated, while she just stared, her gaze now fixed, now moving, taking the ruse to the extent of seeming to disappear into herself sometimes, even letting her eyelids drop; but, as the eyelashes were lattices, the gaze continued its office, taking in the souls and the lives of others.",19,RO005TR05
5765,875,"A second person to worry about was a relative of Virgília, Viegas, a man of seventy winters, desiccated and jaundiced, who suffered from stubborn rheumatism, no less stubborn asthma, and a heart condition: he was a hospital ward made flesh. His eyes, however, shone with much life and health. Virgília initially had no fear of him; She told me that when Viegas seemed to stare, watching, he was simply counting money.",19,RO005TR05
5766,876,"In fact, he was a great miser. There was also Virgília’s cousin, Louis Dutra, whom I had disarmed by convincing him to speak of his verses and prose, and introducing him to my acquaintances. When these people, who recognised his name, seemed pleased with the introduction, there is no doubt that Louis Dutra exulted in happiness; and I drew on that happiness in the hope that he would never denounce us. There were, at last, two or three ladies, several dandies, and the servants, who were naturally so resentful of their servile condition, and together they all constituted a veritable forest of spies and eavesdroppers, among whom we had to slip with the tactics and suppleness of snakes.",19,RO005TR05

I used to eat dinner there; but not having deliberately walked there, none of the action’s merit belongs to me, but to the legs who did it. Blessed legs! And there are those who treat you with disdain or indifference. I myself have hated you before, I was angry when you were fatigued, when you could not go beyond a certain point, and left me with the desire to flap my arms, like a chicken bound by the feet.",19,RO005TR05

Yes, my friends, you left to my head the trouble of thinking of Virgília, and you said to one another: “He must eat, it is dinner, we will take him to the Pharoux; let us share his consciousness, let one side stay there with the lady, let us take the other, so that he may go straight, he will not upset the people or the carts, he’ll take off his hat to his acquaintances, and finally come safely to the hotel.” And you fulfilled your purpose to the letter, lovely legs, which compels me to immortalize you on this page.",19,RO005TR05

When she came to the window, she told me what had happened with the baroness. The baroness told her frankly that there had been much talk in the theater the night before about my absence from Lobo Neves’s stateroom; they had commented on my relations in the house; in short, we were the subject of public suspicion.

Virgília was capable of great sacrifices in order to preserve both, as great for the one as the other, and our escape would leave her with only one.

A pearl!",19,RO005TR05

5783,893,"For me it was a new scenario for our love, an appearance of exclusive possession, of absolute mastery, something that would numb my conscience and preserve propriety. I was tired of the other man’s curtains, of the chairs, of the rug, of the couch, of all these things, which constantly brought our duplicity to my eyes.

I followed the path, retracing an infinity of reflections, which I think are entirely lost; indeed, they could have been the subject of a good chapter, and perhaps a gay one. I like the gay chapters; it is my weakness. Outwardly, the episode of Valongo was frightful; but only externally.

If the idea seems indecorous, I will say that it is what my meals were like with Virgília, in the Gamboa house, where sometimes we had our meal, our luncheon. Wine, fruit, jams, it is true, but all served with sweet words, tender looks, childish caresses, an infinity of these testimonies from the heart, in fact the true, uninterrupted discourse of love.",19,RO005TR05
5825,935,"Sometimes our tempers enhanced the sweetness of the situation. She would leave me, take refuge in a corner of the settee, or go inside to hear the denunciations of Dona Placida. Five or ten minutes later, we would dissect it all, as I dissect the narration, then unleash it again. It should be noted that, far from being averse to correction, it was our custom to invite it, in the person of Dona Placida, to sit with us at the table; but Dona Placida never accepted.",19,RO005TR05

5831,941,"​I do not regret being generous; the coin gave me confidence in Dona Plácida, and consequently in this chapter. Days later, as I found her alone at home, we had a talk, and she briefly told me her story. She was the illegitimate daughter of a sexton at the Cathedral and a woman who sold sweets in the street. She lost her father when she was ten. Already by then she was shaving coconut and doing all kinds of other tasks for candy-making, suitable to her age.",19,RO005TR05
5832,942,"At the age of fifteen or sixteen, she married a tailor, who died of a cough some time later, leaving her with a daughter. A mere girl was left in charge of a daughter, as well as her mother who was worn out from working. She had to support three people. She made sweets, which was the trade she knew, but she also worked hard sewing, day and night, for three or four dealers and taught some children in the neighborhood, for ten pence a month. With that, the years slipped away, though not her beauty, because she had never had any. There were some flirtations, propositions, advances, all of which she resisted.",19,RO005TR05
5833,943,"​“If I could find another husband,” she told me, “I thought I would have married; but nobody wanted to marry me.”",19,RO005TR05
5834,944,"One of the suitors seemed serious; but he turned out no more sincere than the others, Dona Placida dismissed him in the same way, and, after dismissing him, wept very much. She continued to take in sewing and keep the pots going. Her mother had a short temper from her temperament, her age and her poverty; she exhorted her daughter to take one of the suitors who pursued her. And she cried:",19,RO005TR05
5835,945,"“Do you want to be better than me? I do not know where you get these ideas of the wealthy. My girl, life does not do its work for nothing; one does not eat wind. Come on! A young man as good as Polycarpo from the store, poor man. You expect some gentleman, don’t you?”",19,RO005TR05
5836,946,"Dona Placida swore to me that she had not expected any gentleman. It was her nature. She wanted to be married. She knew very well that her mother had not been, and she knew of some who had only lovers; but it was her nature and she wanted to be married. She did not want anything else for her daughter, either. She worked hard, burning her fingers on the stove, and wearing out her eyes on the lamp, so they could eat and not to fall lower. She lost weight, fell ill, lost her mother, buried her with charity funds, and continued to work. The daughter turned fourteen; but she was very placid, and did nothing, except to flirt with the ruffians who surrounded the patella. Dona Placida kept close watch, taking her with her when she had to deliver her sewing. The shopkeepers stared and winked, convinced she was taking her to meet a husband or something. Some offered good-natured remarks and compliments; the mother even received proposals of money.",19,RO005TR05

5838,948,"“My daughter ran away; I did not want to know ... She left me alone, but so sad, so sad, that I thought I would die. There was no one else in the world and I was growing old and sick. It was at this time that I met Iaiá’s family: good people, who gave me work to do, and even gave me a house. I stayed there for many months, a year, more than a year, working, sewing. I left when Iaiá married. Then I lived as God willed. Look at my fingers, look at these hands ...” And she showed me her thick, cracked hands, the scars on the tips of her fingers. “You do not get this way for nothing, my lord; God knows how this is created ... Fortunately, Iaiá protected me, and you, too, doctor ... I was afraid to end up on the street, begging ...”",19,RO005TR05
5839,949,"On speaking the last sentence, Dona Placida trembled. Then, as she returned to herself, she seemed to notice the incongruity of that confession to the lover of a married woman, and she began to laugh, to dismiss herself, to call herself a fool, “full of trust,” as her mother told her; Finally, tired of my silence, she withdrew from the room.

5843,953,"​“So the sexton of the Cathedral, one day, doing the mass, saw the lady enter, who was to be his collaborator in the life of Dona Placida. He saw her on other days, for weeks, she caught his eye, he told her some soft words, brushed her foot, as he climbed the altars, on feast days. She liked him, they got close, they loved each other. From this conjunction of fervent lust came Dona Placida. And though Dona Placida could not speak when she was born, if she had spoken, she could ask the authors of her day:",19,RO005TR05
5844,954,"“Here I am. What did you call me for?” And the sexton and her mistress would naturally respond: “We called you to burn your fingers on the pots, ruin your eyes on the seam, eat badly, or not eat, to run around with your work, get sick and get better, get sick and get better again, sometimes sad, sometimes desperate, sometimes resigned, but always with your hands in the pots and your eyes on the seam, until one day you end in the mud or the hospital; That’s why we called you forth in a moment of harmony.”",19,RO005TR05

5846,956,The manure,19,RO005TR05
5847,957,"​Suddenly my conscience called to me, accused me of having caused Dona Placida’s probity to be surrendered, forcing her into a shameful role, after a long life of work and deprivation. A mediatrix was no better than a concubine, and I had brought her to this office with gifts and money. That’s what my conscience told me; I paused for several minutes without knowing how I would reply. It added that I had taken advantage of Virgília’s hold over the former seamstress, of her gratitude, of her necessity. It pointed out Dona Placida’s resistance, the tears of the first days, the ugly faces, the silences, the lowered eyes, and my determination to endure all this, until it vanished. And it brought it all back to me with anger and agitation.",19,RO005TR05
5848,958,"​I agreed that it was so, but I argued that Dona Placida’s old age was now protected from begging: it was compensation. If it were not for my love affair, Dona Placida would probably end up like so many other human creatures; from which one could deduce that vice is often the manure of virtue. That does not stop virtue from being a fragrant, healthy flower. Conscience agreed, and I went to open the door to Virgília.",19,RO005TR05

5850,960,A meeting,19,RO005TR05
5851,961,"​Virgília walked in smiling and relaxed. Time had carried away the fear and vexation. How sweet it was to see her come, in the early days, ashamed and trembling! She came in a coach, her face veiled, wrapped in a kind of mantle, which disguised the heaving in her chest. For the first time she fell on the couch, panting, scarlet, with her eyes on the floor; and, my word! never did I find her so beautiful, perhaps because I have never been more flattered.",19,RO005TR05
5852,962,"​Now, however, as I said, the fear and vexation was over; our meetings entered their chronometric period. The intensity of love was the same; the difference is that the flame had lost the madness of the first few days and became a steady beam, calm and constant, as in marriages.",19,RO005TR05

5856,966,"In fact, I had broken the word I had given, and it was Virgília’s fault. From jealousy. This splendid woman knew what it was, and she wanted to hear me say it, whether out loud or in a whisper. On the previous evening, at the Baroness’s house, she had twice waltzed with the same dandy, after listening to his flirtations, in a corner by a window. She was so happy! so free! so full of confidence! When she noticed, between my eyebrows, the questioning and threatening wrinkle, she did not become startled or suddenly serious; but she threw to the sea the dandy and his flirtations. She came after me, took me by the arm, and led me to another, less crowded room, where she complained to me of fatigue, and said many other things, with the childish air she used to have, on certain occasions, and I listened but made little acknowledgement.",19,RO005TR05
5857,967,"​At first it was hard for me to answer her, but finally I told her the reason for my absence ... No, eternal stars, I never saw more astonished eyes. The half-open mouth, the eyebrows arched, a visible, tangible stupefaction that could not be denied, was Virgília’s first response. She shook her head with a smile of pity and tenderness that completely confused me.",19,RO005TR05
5858,968,"“Well, you!”",19,RO005TR05
5859,969,"And she took off her hat, light and jovial, like a girl who arrives from school; then drew herself next to me, where I sat, and tapped me on the forehead with one finger, repeating: “This, this;” - and I had no choice but to laugh, and it all ended in whimsy.

5866,976,"​Nothing more was said; but that night Lobo Neves insisted on the project, a little more resolutely than in the afternoon; two days later he told his wife that the presidency was final.

There were moments of silence; we heard only the barking of a dog, and perhaps the sound of the water dying on the beach. I gazed at her in silence. Virgília had her eyes on the ground, her expression dark, her hands on her knees, her fingers crossed in an attitude of supreme hopelessness.",19,RO005TR05
5879,989,"On another occasion, for a different reason, it is certain that I would have fallen at her feet, and protected her with my reason and my affection; but now it was necessary to compel her to make the effort herself, to make the sacrifice, to take on the responsibility for our common life, and consequently to forsake her, to leave her to herself, and to get away; That’s what I did.",19,RO005TR05

I moved between wanting and not wanting, between the pity that drew me back to Virgília’s house and another feeling, - selfishness, I suppose, - that said to me: - Stay; leave her alone with the problem, let her draw on her feelings of love to solve it. I believe that these two forces had equal intensity, drawing in and resisting at the same time, with ardor, with tenacity, and neither gave up.",19,RO005TR05
5885,995,"Sometimes I felt some remorse; it seemed to me that I abused the weakness of a loving and guilty woman, with no sacrifice or risk to myself; and when I was about to capitulate, love would come again, and I would repeat my selfish counsel, and I would be irresolute and restless, desirous to see her, and afraid that the sight would lead me to take on a share of responsibility for the solution.",19,RO005TR05
5886,996,"​At last there was a compromise between selfishness and piety; I would see her at home, and only at home, in the presence of her husband, telling him nothing, waiting for the effect of my arrival. In this way I could reconcile the two forces. Now that I write this, it seems to me that the compromise was a mockery, that this piety was still a form of selfishness, and that the resolution to go and console Virgília was nothing more than a product of my own suffering.",19,RO005TR05

5889,999,"​The next night I went to the house of Lobo Neves; they were both there, Virgília very sad, he very jovial. I swear she showed a certain relief when our eyes met, a look filled with curiosity and tenderness. Lobo Neves told me of his plans for the presidency, his hopes, the local difficulties, the possible resolutions; he was so happy! so hopeful!

No shadow of it; the look came straight and steady, the placidity of his face was natural, not forced, a placidity splashed with joy. I breathed, and I avoided Virgília’s gaze; she looked over the page at me, silently asking me the same thing, and I said yes, that I would do it. In fact, a president, a president’s wife, a secretary, was a sort of administrative solution to the whole problem.",19,RO005TR05

5908,1018,"I found her fatter, and perhaps younger. She looked twenty years old, and she was over thirty. Graceful, affable, no shyness, no resentment. We looked at each other, holding hands, talking about everything and nothing, like two lovers. My childhood resurfaced, fresh, mischievous and blond-haired; the years were falling like the rows of bent playing cards, with which I played when I was small, and they showed me our house, our family, our parties. I sustained the rush of memory with some effort; but I remembered a barber in the neighborhood who played the classical fiddle, and that voice - because until then the memory was mute, - that voice of the past, fiery and longing, moved me, such that ...",19,RO005TR05

Then, a hat appeared at the door, and then a man, Cotrim, no less than Cotrim. I was so moved that I put down the girl and threw myself into her father’s arms. Perhaps this outpouring disconcerted him a little; it’s true that he seemed sheepish. But that was just prologue. We were soon talking like good old friends.",19,RO005TR05

6037,1147,"My! in some places he wanted to cry. But he would never board a ship again. He had been very sick on board, like all the other passengers, except an Englishman ... Let the devil take the English! The country would not be right without them all out. What could England do to us? If he found some people of good will, it was a night’s work to expel the limey bastards. Thank God, he had his patriotism, and he beat his chest, no surprise since it was in the family; he was descended from an old patriot major.",19,RO005TR05
6038,1148,"Yes, he was no nobody. Come the occasion, he would show what he was made of ... But it was getting late, I was going to say that I could not miss dinner, and there we could have a longer talk. I led him to the door of the room; he paused to say how close he felt to me. When he had been married, I was still in Europe. He met my father, a straight man, with whom he had danced at a celebrated Praia Grande ball ... All the things! The things! He’d talk about them later, it was getting late, he had to get the answer to Cotrim. He exited; I closed the door behind him ...",19,RO005TR05

6041,1151,"​What a torment that dinner was! Fortunately, Sabina made me sit next to Damasceno’s daughter, Dona Eulalia, or more familiarly Nha-loló, a very graceful girl, a little shy at first, but only at first. She lacked elegance, but she made up for it with her eyes, which were superb and had only the flaw that they remained on me, except when they went down to her plate; but Nha-loló ate so little that she hardly looked at the plate. At night she sang; her voice was as her father had said, “very sweet.” Nevertheless, I slipped out. Sabina came to the door and asked me how what I had thought of Damasceno’s daughter.",19,RO005TR05

6050,1160,"​At these words, Virgília blushed, as always. She was in the corner at the window, alone, looking at the moon, and welcomed me joyfully; but when I spoke of our son, she was annoyed. She did not like this allusion, she was annoyed by the fatherly caresses she anticipated. And I, for whom she was now a sacred vessel, a divine ampulla, let her be still. I assumed at first that the embryo, this unknown creature, projecting itself into our affair, had restored her awareness of sin.",19,RO005TR05
6051,1161,"I was deceived. Never had Virgília seemed more expansive, more unreserved, less worried about others or her husband. This was not remorse. I also imagined that the pregnancy might be a pure invention, a way of attaching her to me, a short-term strategy, which perhaps began to overwhelm her. This hypothesis was not absurd; My sweet Virgília lied sometimes with such grace!",19,RO005TR05
6052,1162,"​That night I discovered the true cause. It was fear of childbirth and vexation at the pregnancy. She had suffered much when her first child was born; and recalling that occasion, hours spent drifting between life and death, gave her imagined chills of the gallows. As for the vexation, it was compounded by the forced deprivation of certain habits of elegant life. Sure enough, that was it; I told her I understood, reprimanding her a little in the name of my rights as a father. Virgília looked at me; then looked away and smiled incredulously.",19,RO005TR05

It was the embryo, lost before that point at which Laplace can be distinguished from a turtle. I heard the news from Lobo Neves, who left me in the living room, and accompanied the doctor to the bedroom of the grieving mother. I leaned against the window, looking at the little farm, where the orange blossoms grew green. Where are the flowers of old?",19,RO005TR05

6058,1168,"​I felt a tap on my shoulder; it was Lobo Neves. We stood for a few moments, mute, inconsolable. I inquired of Virgília, then we talked for half an hour. At the end of that time they came to bring him a letter; he read it, grew very pale, and closed it with a trembling hand. I think I saw him make a gesture, as if he wanted to throw himself at me; but I do not remember well. What I remember clearly is that during the following days I was cold and morose. Anyway, Virgília told me everything a few days later in Gamboa.",19,RO005TR05
6059,1169,"​Her husband showed her the letter as soon as she recovered. It was anonymous and it denounced us. It did not reveal everything; it did not speak, for example, of our external assignations; it just cautioned him about my intimacy, and added that the suspicion was public. Virgília read the letter and told him with indignation that it was an infamous slander.",19,RO005TR05

6061,1171,“Infamous.”,19,RO005TR05
6062,1172,"Her husband relaxed; but as he re-read the letter, it seemed that every word of it made a negative sign with each finger, each letter on the page cried out against his wife’s indignation. This intrepid man was now the most frail of creatures. Perhaps he imagined in the distance the notorious gaze of public opinion, looking at him sarcastically, with a distant air; perhaps an invisible mouth repeated in his ear insinuations he had once heard or overheard. He urged his wife to confess everything, because he could forgive her anything.",19,RO005TR05
6063,1173,"Virgília knew that she was safe; she was irritated by his insistence, she swore she had only had courtesies and teases from me. The letter had to be from some unfortunate suitor. And she mentioned a few, - one who had frankly pursued her for a few weeks, another who had written her a letter, and still others and others. She listed them by name, with the details, studying the eyes of her husband, and concluded by saying that, in order not to give fuel to slander, she would treat me so coldly that I would not return there.",19,RO005TR05
6064,1174,"​ I heard all this a little disturbed, not by the added concealment that had to be employed from now on, requiring me to avoid entirely the house of Lobo Neves, but by the moral tranquility of Virgília, the lack of emotion, of fear, of nostalgia, even of remorse. Virgília noticed my concern, raised my head, because I was looking at the floor, and said with some bitterness:",19,RO005TR05

I did not tell her anything. She tapped nervously with her toe on the floor; I approached and kissed her on the forehead. Virgília retreated, as if it were a kiss of death.",19,RO005TR05

Look at the picture: in a little house in Gamboa, two people who have loved each other for a long time, one leaning toward the other, giving her a kiss on the forehead, and the other pulling back, as if sensing the feeling of a corpse’s mouth. There is in the brief interval between the mouth and the forehead, before the kiss and after the kiss, there is sufficient room for a lot of things - the contraction of resentment - the wrinkle of mistrust - or finally the pale, sleepy whiff of satiety ...",19,RO005TR05

6072,1182,"​We parted happily. I had dinner reconciled with the situation. The anonymous letter restored to our affair the salt of mystery and the pepper of danger; and in the end it was a good thing that Virgília did not lose possession of herself in that crisis. At night I went to the Teatro de São Pedro; It was a great performance, in which Estela drew tears. I entered; I ran my eyes over the boxes; I saw in one of them Damasceno and his family. His daughter was made up elaborately and elegantly, something difficult to explain, because the father earned only enough to be indebted; but then maybe that was the cause.",19,RO005TR05
6073,1183,"​During the interval I went to visit them. Damasceno received me with many kind words, his wife with many smiles. As for Nha-loló, she did not take her eyes from me. She seemed more beautiful now than at dinner. I found a certain ethereal gentleness married to the polished beauty of earthly forms: - a vague expression, and worthy of a chapter in which everything is to be vague. I really do not know how to tell you that I did not feel ill at the girl’s side, a girl clad in a thin dress, a dress that gave me a tickle of Tartufo.",19,RO005TR05
6074,1184,"In contemplating it, chastely and roundly covering her knee, I made a subtle discovery, namely, that nature foresaw the human garment, a necessary condition for the development of our species. Perpetual nudity, given the multiplicity of mundane tasks and the preoccupations of the individual, would tend to dull the senses and retard the attraction of the sexes, whereas clothing, by negating nature, sharpens and attracts our will, activates it, stimulates it, and consequently makes civilization progress. Blessed custom that gave us Othello and the transatlantic packages!",19,RO005TR05
6075,1185,"​I want to delete this chapter. The slope is slippery. But in the end I write my memoirs and not yours, patient reader. Next to the graceful maiden, I seemed to have a double, indefinable sensation. It expressed perfectly the duality of Pascal, l’ange et la bête, with the difference that the Jansenist did not admit the simultaneity of the two natures, while they were very close together, - l’ange, which spoke some things from heaven, - and la bête, that ...

But in the next interval, before the curtain went up, we found ourselves in one of the corridors, where there was no one. He came to me, with much affability and laughter, drew me into one of the alcoves of the theater, and we talked a while, especially he, who seemed the most tranquil of men. I even asked him about his wife; he replied that she was fine, but he quickly changed the topic, his mood expansive, almost frivolous. Explain the difference how you will; I fled from Damasceno who was lurking at the door to the box.",19,RO005TR05
6079,1189,"​I heard nothing of the following act, neither the words of the actors, nor the applause of the audience. Reclining in my chair, I dissected my memory of Lobo Neves’ conversation, replayed his manners in my mind, and concluded that the new situation was much better. It was enough that we had Gamboa. To visit their house would arouse suspicion. We needn’t talk every day; it was even better, it left us longing for love. Anyway, I was in my forties, and I was nothing, not even a simple parish elector. It was urgent that I do something, even for Virgília’s sake, so she could boast when she saw my name shine ... I think there was great applause at that moment, but I do not swear it; my mind was elsewhere.",19,RO005TR05

An example of this second class is the present chapter, whose reading I recommend to all people who love the study of social phenomena. It seems, and it is not improbable, that there is a certain reciprocal, regular, and perhaps periodic oscillation between the facts of public life and those of private life - or, to use an image, there is something similar to the tides of Praia do Flamengo and other equally powerful currents. Indeed, when the wave invests the beach, it floods it many palms deep; but this same water will turn back to the sea with variable force, and will thicken the wave that is to come, and that will have to become like the first. This is the image; let’s look at the application.",19,RO005TR05

Thus the particular fact of the hatred of a number produced the phenomenon of political dissent. It remains to be seen how, later on, a political act determined a cessation of movement in private life. It is not fitting for the method of this book to immediately describe this other phenomenon, but I will say for the moment that Lobo Neves, four months after our meeting in the theater, reconciled with the ministry; a fact which the reader must not lose sight of if he wishes to penetrate the subtlety of my thought.",19,RO005TR05

And I do not know why, I feared that the imperial letter of appointment might draw her to virtue, not to virtue for its own sake, but out of gratitude to her husband. She sincerely loved the nobility; and one of the greatest disruptions in our life was the appearance of a certain member of a legation, - of the Dalmatian legation, it was - Count B.V., who courted her for three months. This man, a noble gentleman by blood, and a diplomat to boot, had turned Virgília’s head a while. I can’t imagine what might have become of me if a revolution had not broken out in Dalmatia, which overthrew the government and turned over all the embassies. It was a bloody revolution, painful, formidable; the newspapers, with every ship that came from Europe, described the horrors, measured the blood, counted the heads; everyone was wild with indignation and pity ...

I listened without saying anything to her; I wondered if it would have been better to have Virgília stay in the bedroom and for me to emerge into the parlour; but I realised it would have been worse; it would have confirmed his suspicion, sent a spark to the gunpowder, and a bloody scene would have ensued ... It was much better this way. But later? What was going to happen at Virgília’s house? Would her husband kill her? Would he slap her around? Would he lock her up? Expel her? These questions ran slowly through my brain, as dots and dark commas run through the visual field of sick or tired eyes. They came and went with their tragic, dry appearance, and I could not grab one of them and say, It’s you, you and no other.",19,RO005TR05

In the end, it seemed to me she played a dangerous game, and I wondered if it was not time to get up and take a stroll. I was filled with a longing for marriage, a desire to arrange my life. Why not? My heart still had room to explore; I did not feel incapable of a chaste, strict and pure love. Truly, love affairs are the torrential and vertiginous part of life, that is, the exception; I was angry about it all; I do not know if I perhaps even felt some remorse. As soon as I thought about it, I surrendered to my imagination; I was soon married to an adorable woman, with a baby sleeping in the maid’s lap, all of us at the back of a somber green chateau, peering through the trees at a wash of extremely blue blue sky ...",19,RO005TR05

This scrap of paper, just a scrawl in parts, crumpled in my hand, was a document needing analysis, which I will not do in this chapter or in the next, or perhaps in the rest of the book. Let it please the reader to note for himself the coolness, the insight, and the mood of these few lines written in a hurry; and behind them the storm of another brain, the disguised anger, the despair that is constrained and meditated, is it because it has to resolve itself in the mud, or in tears?",19,RO005TR05

But if I describe the turmoil it caused me, doubt the assertion a little, and do not accept it without proof. Not even then, I have not yet come to discuss what I experienced. It was fear, and it was not fear; it was pity and it was not pity; it was vanity, and not vanity; in short, it was love without love, that is, without delirium; and all this made for a very complex and vague combination, something that you cannot understand, as I did not understand.

I had not forgotten this minimal circumstance; in the midst of so much that was important, obliterated from my mind, this breakfast slipped through. The main reason could have just been my disaster; but it was not; the main reason was the reflection made to me by Quincas Borba, whose visit I received that day.",19,RO005TR05
6152,1262,"He told me that frugality was not necessary to understand Humanitism, let alone to practice it; that this philosophy was easily accommodated with the pleasures of life, including the table, the theatre, and the bedroom; and that, on the contrary, frugality might indicate a certain tendency toward asceticism, which was the complete expression of human foolishness.",19,RO005TR05

And if I do not tell the story, I also refrain from describing the figure, which is very different from the one that appeared to me on the Passeio Público. I’ll shut up; I say only that if the main characteristic of a man is not his features, but his clothing, he was not Quincas Borba; he was an unsecured debtor, a general without a uniform, a businessman with no debts.

As for his manners, without having lost the vivacity of past days, he did not have the manic manner, he subjected himself to a certain discipline. But I do not want to describe it. If I spoke, for example, of the gold button he had on his chest, and the quality of the leather of his boots, I would be launching into a description, which I must omit for brevity. Be content to know that the boots were polished. Know also than he had inherited a stock of contos from an old uncle from Barbacena.",19,RO005TR05

The narration of Quincas Borba gave it a whack, it took off; when it was about to fall, Virgília’s note gave it another whack, and it was again thrown into the air; and the episode of the Passeio Público dealt it another, equally sharp and effective blow. I know that I was not born for these convoluted scenarios. This pulling and thrusting of opposing things made me unbalanced; I wanted to wrap up Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves and Virgília’s note in the same philosophy, and send them as a present to Aristotle. However, our philosopher’s narrative was instructive; I admired above all the talent of observation with which he described the gestation and growth of vice, the inner struggles, the slow capitulations, the use of mud.",19,RO005TR05

And she concluded: “The wall is down on the alley side.”",19,RO005TR05

She was not just inviting scandal, she was inviting it in partnership with ridicule. I imagined myself creeping down the alley, finding the low point, leaping over the wall; and when I was about to get over, getting caught by a beat cop, who would haul me to the station. The wall is down! And what if it was down? Naturally Virgília did not know what she did; it was possible she already regretted it. I looked at the paper, crumpled, but inflexible. I had an itch to tear it up, in thirty thousand pieces, and toss them in the wind, as the last spoil of our affair; but I caught myself in time; self-love, the vexation of flight, a sense of ​​fear ...

He took advantage of the first acquaintance who passed us by, and left me after many friendly words. I remember that I was distracted, but I tried to conceal it. It seemed to me then (and I beg the pardon of critics, if my judgment is reckless!) - it seemed to me that he was afraid - not afraid of me, nor of himself, nor of the law, nor of conscience; He was afraid of public opinion.",19,RO005TR05
6180,1290,"I assumed that this anonymous and invisible tribunal, in which each member accuses and judges, was the limit placed on the will of Lobo Neves. Perhaps he no longer loved his wife; and thus it may be that his heart was indifferent whether to indulge her recent behavior. I presumed (and again I urge the good will of the critic!), I presumed that he would be ready to separate himself from his wife, as the reader has separated from many personal relationships; but public opinion, this opinion that would drag his life through the streets, that would open a meticulous inquiry into the case, that would collate one by one all the circumstances, antecedents, inductions, proofs, that would pass the report along through the most distant farms, that terrible opinion, so curious about bedroom matters, prevented the break-up of the family.",19,RO005TR05

Their son, growing up, would seek to satisfy his father’s ambitions; he would be the heir to all his affections.

It is not impossible for me to develop this thought before finishing the book; but neither is it impossible that I should leave it as it is. In one way or another, public opinion is formed, both in the domestic and in the political sphere. Some bilious metaphysicians have reached the extreme of presenting it as the simple product of the weak-minded or the mediocre; but it is evident that even when such an extreme conceit does not produce the answer by itself, it is enough to consider the salutary effects of public opinion to conclude that it is the superfinite work of the flower of men, namely, the greatest number.",19,RO005TR05

6212,1322,"​Virgília’s departure gave me a taste of widowhood. The first few days I spent in the house, catching flies, like Domitian, if Suetonius did not lie, but catching them in a particular way: with my eyes. I caught them one by one at the back of a large room, stretched out in the hammock, with a book open in my hands. I felt it all: homesickness, ambition, a little boredom, and a lot of daydreaming. My uncle the canon died during that period; also, two cousins. I did not feel shaken; I took them to the graveyard, like someone who takes money to a bank. What can I say? Like one who takes letters to the post office: I sealed the letters, put them in the box, and trusted the postman’s care in delivering them.

6217,1327,"​Two forces, however, added to a third, compelled me to return to my customary hectic life: Sabina and Quincas Borba. My sister pursued the matter of my marriage to Nha-loló in a truly impetuous way. When I came to my senses I had the girl almost in my arms. As for Quincas Borba, he exposed me at last to Humanitism, a system of philosophy destined to ruin all other systems.",19,RO005TR05
6218,1328,"​“Humanitas,” he said, “the principle of things, is none other than the same man divided by all men. Humanitas counts three phases: the static, previous to all the creation; the expansive, beginning of things; the dispersive, appearance of man; and it will count one more, the contractive, absorption of man and things. The expansion, initiating the universe, suggested to Humanitas the desire to enjoy it, and hence the dispersion, which is no more than the personified multiplication of the original substance.”",19,RO005TR05
6219,1329,"​As this exhibition did not appear clear enough, Quincas Borba developed it in a profound way, noting the broad lines of the system. He explained to me that, on the one hand, Humanitism was linked to Brahmanism, namely, in the distribution of men by the different parts of Humanitas’s body; but what in the Indian religion had only a narrow theological and political significance was in Humanitism the great law of personal value. Thus, descending from Humanitas’s chest or kidneys, that is, being a strong one, was not the same as descending from the hair or the tip of the nose. Hence the need to cultivate and shape the muscle. Hercules was but an early symbol of Humanitism.",19,RO005TR05
6220,1330,"At this point Quincas Borba pondered that paganism might have come to the truth, if only it had shed the gallant parts of its myths. None of this will happen to Humanitism. In this new church there are no easy affairs, no falls, no sorrows, no childish joys. Love, for example, is a priesthood, reproduction a ritual. As life is the greatest benefit of the universe, and there is no beggar who does not prefer misery to death (which is a delightful influx of Humanitas), it follows that the transmission of life, far from being an occasion of gallantry, is the supreme hour of the spiritual mass. For truly there is only one misfortune: it is not to be born.",19,RO005TR05
6221,1331,"​“Imagine, for example, that I was not born,” continued Quincas Borba; “it is a sure thing that I would not have the pleasure of talking to you now, eating this potato, going to the theater, and to say everything in one word: being alive. Note that I do not make man a mere vehicle of Humanitas; no, he is both vehicle, coachman and passenger; he is a reduced form of Humanitas itself; hence the need to worship oneself. Do you want proof of the superiority of my system? Consider envy. There is no Greek or Turkish moralist, Christian or Muslim, who doesn’t thunder against the feeling of envy. The agreement is universal, from the fields of Idumeia to Alto da Tijuca.",19,RO005TR05
6222,1332,"Well; give up the old prejudices, forget the rhetorical chestnuts, and study envy, that feeling so subtle and so noble. Each man being a reduction of Humanitas, it is clear that no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, whatever appearances to the contrary. Thus, for example, the executioner who executes the condemned may excite the vain clamor of the poets; but substantially it is Humanitas that corrects in Humanitas an infraction of the law of Humanitas. The same will be said of the individual who guts another; he is a manifestation of the strength of Humanitas. Nothing prevents (and there are examples) him equally being gutted. If you have understood this well, you will easily understand that envy is nothing more than an admiration that strives, and since struggle is the great function of the human race, all bellicose feelings are most well suited to your happiness. It follows that envy is a virtue.”",19,RO005TR05

6224,1334,"​Why deny it? I was stunned. The clarity of the exposition, the logic of the principles, the rigor of the deductions, all seemed superior, and I had to suspend the conversation for a few minutes while digesting the new philosophy. Quincas Borba could scarcely conceal his satisfaction in his triumph. He had a chicken wing on his plate, and he cracked it with philosophical serenity. I still made some objections to him, but they were so weak, that he did not spend much time destroying them.",19,RO005TR05
6225,1335,"​“To understand my system well,” he concluded, “we must never forget the universal principle, which is embodied and summarized in every man. Look, war, which looks like a calamity, is a convenient operation, as it were the snapping of Humanitas’s fingers; hunger (and he sucked philosophically on the chicken wing), hunger is a test to which Humanitas submits the viscera itself. But I do not want a better proof of the sublimity of my system, beyond this chicken.",19,RO005TR05
6226,1336,"It was fed on corn, which was planted by an African, suppose, imported from Angola. This African was born, grew, sold; a ship made of wood cut in the bush by ten or twelve men, carried by sails, which eight or ten men wove, not counting the string and other parts of the nautical apparatus. So this chicken, which I have eaten right now, is the result of a multitude of efforts and struggles, executed as the sole purpose of satisfying my appetite.”",19,RO005TR05
6227,1337,"​Between cheese and coffee Quincas Borba showed me that his system was the destruction of pain. Pain, according to Humanitism, is a pure illusion. When the child is threatened by a stick, before he has even been beaten, he closes his eyes and trembles; this predisposition is the basis of human illusion, inherited and transmitted. The adoption of the system to put an end to pain is not enough, but it is indispensable; the rest is the natural evolution of things. Since man is well aware that he is Humanitas himself, he need nothing more than to trace the thought back to the original substance to prevent any painful sensation. This evolution, however, is so profound that it can scarcely be completed for thousands of years.",19,RO005TR05
6228,1338,"​Quincas Borba read to me from his great work day after day. There were four manuscript volumes, one hundred pages each, with small print and Latin quotations. The last volume consisted of a political treaty, based on Humanitism; it was perhaps the most boring part of the system, though conceived with a formidable rigor of logic.",19,RO005TR05
6229,1339,"Society was reorganized by his method, enabling the elimination of war, insurrection, common assault, anonymous stabbings, misery, hunger, disease; but because these supposed scourges are actually delusions of the understanding, because they would be no more than external movements of the inner substance, destined not to influence man, but a simple breach of universal monotony, it was clear that their existence need not impede human happiness.",19,RO005TR05
6230,1340,"As such scourges (which were radically false) would correspond in the future to the narrow conceptions of ancient times, the system would never be destroyed, and for two reasons: First, because Humanitas being the creative and absolute substance, every individual should find the greatest delight in the world in sacrificing himself to the principle from which it descends; Second, because it would not diminish the spiritual power of man on earth, invented only for his recreation, as the stars, breezes, dates, and rivers were.

As Damasceno lived in the Cajueiros, I often accompanied them to Mass. The hill was still bare of dwellings, save the old mansion up above, where the chapel was.

In the middle of the hill we found a group of men. Damasceno, who was standing beside us, realised what it was and came forward with excitement; we went after him. And we saw them; men of all ages, sizes and colors, some in shirt sleeves, others in jacket, others in tattered frock coats; various attitudes, squatting, others with their hands on their knees, some sitting on the stones, others leaning against the wall, and all with their eyes fixed in the center, and their souls leaning out of their pupils.",19,RO005TR05

I saw the two contenders, two cocks with sharp spurs, eyes of fire, and razor beaks. They both waved their bloody combs; their chests were plucked and red; fatigue invaded them. But they fought on still, eyes fixed on eyes, beak down, beak up, a blow here, a blow there, vibrant and angry. Damasceno did not see anything else; the spectacle eliminated the whole universe for him. In vain I told him that it was time to leave: he did not answer, he did not listen, he concentrated on the duel. The cockfight was one of his passions.",19,RO005TR05

I have already said that the hill was then uninhabited; I also told you that we had come from the Mass, but I didn’t say that it was raining, in fact the weather was fine, a delicious sun. It was strong. So strong that I opened a parasol, I held it by the center of the handle, and tilted it so that I added a page to the philosophy of Quincas Borba: Humanitas osculated Humanitas ... That’s how the years fell away from me down the hill below.",19,RO005TR05

One of them had his crest so bruised and bloody, that I had him for the vanquished one; but it was a mistake - the loser was the other, who had no crest. Both had their beaks open, breathing hard, worn out.

The ease with which he had joined the gamblers brought back old customs and social affinities, and Nha-loló had come to fear that such a father-in-law would seem to me unworthy. It was remarkable the difference in her; she studied herself and studied me. The elegant and polished life attracted her, especially since it seemed to her the surest way of uniting our families. Nha-loló watched, imitated, guessed; at the same time, she endeavored to mask the inferiority of her family. But on that day the manifestation of her father’s nature was such that it grieved her greatly. I tried to distract her from the subject by making jokes and teasing her gently; a vain effort, which did not please her. Her dejection was so profound, so full of discouragement, that I realised Nha-loló wanted to separate herself from her father entirely in my eyes.

The esteem that lifts a hat from a head reveals nothing of the soul; but the indifference of that courtesy leaves a delightful impression. The reason is that, unlike an old absurd formula, it is not the letter that kills; the letter gives life; the spirit is the object of controversy, of doubt, of interpretation, and consequently of struggle and death.

That was my interest; and understanding the principle of Helvetius in a superficial way, this is what I should have done. But I have already given the reason for male indiscretion: beside that interest in security there was another, that of pride, which is more intimate, more immediate: the former is reflexive, an earlier syllogism supposed; the second is spontaneous, instinctive, it comes from the bowels of the subject; finally, the first has a remote effect, the second a direct one.

Then - and see how far a man’s imagination can go, when he is sleepy - then it seemed to me I heard a bat perched on the roof: Lord Brás Cubas, your rejuvenation was in the room, in the crystals, in the lights, in the silks, - finally, in other people.",19,RO005TR05

Tempora mutantur. [Times change.] She understands that this whirlwind is like that, it takes the leaves of the bush and the rags of the road, without exception or pity; and if you have a little philosophy, do not envy, but it hurts those who took the carriage, because they too will have to be stopped by the groom OBLIVION.

Fifty years old is the age for science and government. Take courage, Brás Cubas; do not be foolish. What have you to do with this succession from ruin to ruin or from flower to flower? Try to savor life; and learn that the worst philosophy is that of the whiners who lie on the bank of the river in order to lament the incessant course of the waters.

I was courting the cabinet by means of courtesies, teas, commissions; and the portfolio did not come. I had to seize the podium.",19,RO005TR05
6357,1467,"​I started slowly. Three days later, when discussing the budget of the Justice department, I took the opportunity to ask the minister modestly if he did not think it would be useful to reduce the size of the national guard’s barrentinas. It was a minor matter; but still I proved that I was not unworthy of the cogitations of a statesman; and I called on Philophemus, who had ordered the replacement of the small shields of his troops with larger ones, as well as the spears, which were also too light; a fact that history will show does not undermine the gravity of its pages.",19,RO005TR05

As for its form, its eloquent rapture, the literary and philosophical content, opinion was united; I was told by everyone that it was perfect, and that no one had ever been able to draw such ideas from a barretina. But the political content was considered by many deplorable; some thought my speech to be a parliamentary disaster; finally, I was told that many now considered me part of the opposition, including the chamber’s opposition party itself, which started to speak quietly of a motion of no confidence.",19,RO005TR05
6363,1473,"I strongly repudiated such an interpretation, which was not only erroneous, but slanderous, in view of the notoriety with which I supported the cabinet; I added that the need to reduce the barretina was not so great that it could not wait a few years; and that, in any case, I would compromise on the extent of the cut, contenting myself with three quarters of an inch or less; In fact, given that my motion was not adopted, I had done enough by proposing it.",19,RO005TR05

If the passion for power is the strongest of all, as some teach, imagine the despair, the pain, the dejection of the day I lost my seat in the Chamber of Deputies. End of my hopes; of my political career.

A Cromwell or a Bonaparte, he added, even as the passion of power burns in them, are willing to climb the ladder on the left, or on the right. This was not my feeling; as they had not the same force in themselves, they did not have equal confidence in the result; and hence they faced the greatest distress, the greatest disenchantment, the greatest sorrow. My feeling, according to Humanitism ...",19,RO005TR05

They brought us coffee; it was one o’clock in the afternoon, we were in my study, a beautiful room, which opened onto the back of the house, with good books, works of art, a Voltaire among them, a bronze Voltaire, whose sarcastic smile, with which he looked at me, seemed to be accentuated by the occasion, the rascal; excellent chairs; outside, the sun, a great sun, that Quincas Borba, I do not know if it was a pun or poetry, called one of the ministers of nature; there was a fresh wind, the sky was blue.",19,RO005TR05

I noticed that he was sincerely happy, the joy of a great philosopher. He made me observe the beauty of the spectacle, recalled the object of the struggle, concluded that the dogs were hungry; but the deprivation of food was nothing to the general effects of philosophy. Nor did he fail to recall that in some parts of the globe the spectacle is greater; the human creatures fight with the dogs for bones and other delicacies less appetizing; a struggle that is very complicated, because the intelligence of man comes into play, with all the accumulation of wit that the centuries gave him, and so on.",19,RO005TR05

He says that man has ‘a great advantage over the rest of the universe: he knows that he dies, while the universe knows nothing of this.’ See? Therefore, the man who fights with a dog for a bone has the great advantage of knowing that he is hungry; and this is what makes the fight great, as I said.",19,RO005TR05

Again I asked myself, as in Chapter 75, if this was why the sacristan of the Cathedral and the sweets-maker had brought Dona Placido into the light, in a moment of particular passion. But I soon realized that if it had not been for Dona Placida, perhaps my love for Virgília might have been interrupted, or immediately broken off, in the midst of its effervescence; this was, therefore, the usefulness of Dona Placida’s life.

It is an act that causes a certain deprivation of the beneficiary to cease. Once it has produced the essential effect, that is, once the deprivation ceases, it returns the organism to the previous state, to the indifferent state. Suppose you have tightened the waistband of your pants too far; to stop the annoyance, you unbutton the waistband, you breathe, you savor an instant of joy, then the organism becomes indifferent, and you do not remember your fingers that performed the act.",19,RO005TR05

The hope of other favors, indeed, always preserves the memory of the first; but this fact, in fact one of the most sublime that philosophy can find in its path, is explained by the memory of deprivation, or, using another formula, by the continued deprivation in memory, which reverberates past pain and advises the timely precaution of the remedy. I do not claim that, even without this circumstance, the memory of the gift, sometimes accompanied by a more or less intense affection, does not persist; but they are true aberrations, worthless in the eyes of a philosopher.”",19,RO005TR05

The persistence of the benefit in the memory of those who offer it is explained by the very nature of the benefit and its effects. First, there is the feeling of having acted well, and deductively the awareness that we are capable of good deeds; secondly, one receives a conviction of superiority over another creature, superiority in the state and in the means; and this is one of the most legitimately pleasing things, according to the best opinions, to the human organism.",19,RO005TR05

This is a difficult combination that I could not resolve; at home, however, getting out of the carriage, I suspected that the combination was possible, and even easy. Sweet Nature!

And I followed her, as pagemas as the other, as if the order were given to me, I let go boyfriend, vibrant, full of the first auroras. Halfway there, they called her ""beautiful Marcella,"" she reminded me that I had heard such a name from my Uncle Joao, and I was, I confess, that I was dizzy.",18,RO005TR04

The Xavier, with all his tubercles, presided at the night banquet, in which I ate little or nothing, because I only had eyes for the mistress of the house. How sweet she was in Spanish! There were another half a dozen women, all party, and beautiful, full of grace, but the Spanish ... Enthusiasm, a few sips of wine, the imperious genius, mad, all this led me to do a single thing ; at the door, I told my uncle to wait for a moment, and I went back up the stairs.",18,RO005TR04

That there are indeed two means of advancing the will of women: the violent, like the bull of Europe, and the insinuating, like Leda's cysne and Danae's gold rain, three inventions of Father Zeus, who, for being fashionable, there they are exchanged on horse and donkey. I will not tell the moths that I conjured, or the pitas, nor the alternatives of confidence and fear, nor the idle waits, nor any other of these preliminary things. I declare to them that the donkey was worthy of the corsel, —a donkey of Sancho, indeed a philosopher, who took me to her house at the end of that period; I fell on his hip and told him to graze.",18,RO005TR04

In the first, which was short, we ruled Xavier and myself, without him ever believing to share the government of Rome with me; but when credulity could not resist the evidence, Xavier gave up the insignia, and I concentrated all the powers in my hand; was the cesarean phase. The universe was mine; but sad it was not for free. I had to collate money, multiply it, invent it.",18,RO005TR04

But to the extreme came the abuse, that he restricted the franks a little, then more, then more. Then I turned to my mother, and induced her to divert something, which she gave me in secret. It was little; I made use of a last resort: I went on to strike over my father's inheritance, to assign obligations, which he was to redeem one day with usury.",18,RO005TR04

I have listened to him in silence, and he has not oppressed the order of the voyage, as he had done at other times; rumination, the idea of ​​taking Marcella with me. I went to her; expounds the crisis and made the proposal. Marcella listened to me with her eyes in the air, without answering; as he insisted, told me he was staying, that he could not go to Europe.",18,RO005TR04

I brought the maid to her, in a silver bowl, which was part of my eleven stories. Marcella politely offered me refreshment; my answer was to reach with my hand in the glass and in the salvo; The liquid in her lap was spilled, the black woman screamed, I begged her to leave. Being alone, I poured out all the despair of my heart; I told her that she was a monster, who had already had love for me, who had let me come down to everything, without at least the excuse of sincerity; I called him many ugly names, making many decomposed gestures.",18,RO005TR04
6781,261,"Marcella had sat there, clawing at her teeth, cold as a piece of marble. I had the urge to strangle her, to humiliate her at least, to subjugate her at my feet. Perhaps he would do it; but the action was changed in another; it was I who threw myself at the feet of the court, and supplice; I kissed them, I remembered those months of our solitary happiness, I repeated to him the beloved names of another time, sitting on the floor, with his head between her knees, clasping his hands very much; I asked her with lagrymas that she would not forsake me ...

6787,267,"So I decided to embark immediately to cut my life in two halves, and delighted in the idea that Marcella, knowing of the departure, would be grateful for regrets and remorse.

Marcella had a slight start; the pupilla blazed like a hungry hawk; She lifted half her body, and leaning on an elbow, looked at the comb for a few short instants; then he withdrew his eyes; he had mastered himself. Then I tossed his hands into his hair, put them together, linked them in a hurry, improvised a headdress, without any line, and finished with the diamond comb; I drew back, came back to him, corrected his locks, lowered them on one side, sought some symmetry in that disorder, all with a thoroughness and a mother's affection.",18,RO005TR04

She was not thin, she was transparent; it was impossible that he would not die at any moment. The captain pretended not to believe in the near death, perhaps by deceiving himself. I did not know or think anything. What did I care about the fate of a woman in the middle of the ocean? The world for me was Marcella.",18,RO005TR04

At this point they came looking for him on the part of the party; we run both; it was a crisis.

When he puts his eyes on the tip of his nose, he loses the feeling of external things, embellishes himself in the invisible, apprehends the impalpable, dissociates himself from the earth, dissolves, and becomes effluent.

She did not want her daughter to be anything else either. And he worked hard, burning his fingers to the stove, and his eyes to the lamp, to eat and not fall. She emaciated, fell ill, lost her mother, buried her by subscription, and continued to work. The daughter was fourteen years old; but it was very weak, and it did nothing, except to date the cappadocians that surrounded the letter.

That's what he told me to conscience; and I stayed for ten minutes without knowing that I would reply.

I swear she felt some relief, when our eyes met, filled with curiosity and tenderness; and I will not say what I felt, because this has already been expressed in the previous chapter, in fine. Lobo Neves told me of his plans for the presidency, the local difficulties, the hopes, the resolutions; I was so happy! so hopeful!

No shadow of it; the look came straight and straight, the placidness of the face was natural, not violent, a placidity splashed with joy. I breathed, and I had no desire to look at Virgilia; I looked over the page at the sight of her, who asked me for the same thing, and said yes, that I would.

It was my childhood that resurged, fresh, mischievous and blond; the years were falling, like the rows of bowed playing cards, with which I played as a child, and they let me see our house, our family, our parties.

 Ella melted the corners of her mouth, and moved her head on either side; but this gesture of indifference was denied by something less definable, less clear, an expression of taste and hope. And I do not know why I imagined that the imperial letter of the appointment could attrail it to virtue, not by virtue in itself, but by gratitude to the husband. That she loved the nobility cordially; and one of the greatest displeasures of our life was the appearance of a certain legion of legation, —of the Dalmatian legation, suppose, —or Count BV, who dated her for three months. This man, a noble gentleman of the race, had upset Virgilia's head a little, which, moreover, had a diplomatic vocation. I do not succeed in achieving what would become of me if a revolution did not break out in Dalmatia, which overthrew the government and purified the embassies. The revolution was bloody, painful, formidable; the journeys, with every ship that came from Europe, transcribed the horrors, measured the blood, counted the heads; everyone was furious with indignation and pity ... I did not; I blessed inwardly this tragedy, which had taken a pebble from my shoe. And then Dalmatia was so far away!",18,RO005TR04

There was a time when I came to suppose that she had said no more than to stop me; but the mere reflection suffices to show that, after ten minutes of the alcove, the most genuine and cordial gesture could not be other than this. And this by that famous law of the equivalence of janellas, which I had the satisfaction of discovering and formulating, in ch. LI. It was necessary to open the conscience.

Why not? My heart still had to explore; I did not feel incapable of chaste, severe and pure love. In fact, adventures are the torrential and vertiginous part of life, that is, the exception; I was angry with them; I do not know even if I felt any remorse.

I know that I was not born for complex situations. This pulling and thrusting of opposing things unbalanced me; wanted to wrap Quincas Borba, Lobo Neves, and Virgilia's note in the same philosophia, and send them to Aristoteles as a gift.

Some bilious metaphysics have come to the extreme of giving it as a simple product of the fickle or mediocre people; but it is evident that even when such an extreme concept did not bring the answer within itself, it was enough to consider the salutary effects of opinion, to conclude that it is the superfine work of men's flowers, namely, the greatest number.",18,RO005TR04

7842,1322,"Virgilia's departure gave me a taste of widowhood. In the first few days I came to my house, to catch flies, like Domitian, if I do not lie to Suetonius, but to fissile them in a particular way: with my eyes. He was patting them one by one at the back of a large room, stretched out in the hammock, with a book open in his hands. It was everything: homesickness, ambition, a little tedium, and a lot of daydreaming. My uncle died in that interval; item, two cousins; and I was not shaken; I took them to the cemetery, like someone who takes money to a bank. What do I say? like those who take letters to the post office: I sealed the letters, put them in the box, and left the postman careful to hand them over to him.

7847,1327,"Two forces, however, besides a third, compelled me to return to the hectic life of custom: Sabina and Quincas Borba. My sister referred to the marital candidacy of Nha—lolo in a truly impetuous way. When I found myself I was with the girl almost in my arms. As for Quincas Borba, he has at last exposed to me Humanitism, a system of philosophy destined to ruin all other systems.",18,RO005TR04
7848,1328,"Humanitas, said he, ""the beginning of things, is none other than the same man divided among all men. It tells three phases Humanitas; the static, prior to all creation; the expansive, the beginning of things; the dispersive, appearance of man; and it will count one more, the contractive, absorption of man and of things. The expansion, initiating the universe, suggested to Humanitas the desire to enjoy it, and hence the dispersion, which is no more than the personified multiplication of the original substance.",18,RO005TR04
7849,1329,"As this exposition did not appear clear enough, Quincas Borba developed it in a profound way, noting the broad lines of the system. He explained that, on the one hand, Humanitism was linked to Brahmanism, namely, in the distribution of men by the different parts of Humanitas's body; but that in the Indian religion had only a narrow theological and political significance, it was in Humanitism the great law of personal value. Thus, descending from the chest or the kidneys of Humanitas, that is, to be a strong, was not the same as descending from the hair or the tip of the nose. Hence the need to cultivate and temper the muscle. Hercules or Herakles was but an early symbol of Humanitism.",18,RO005TR04
7850,1330,"At this point, Quincas Borba pondered that paganism might have come to the truth, had it not been for the gallant part of its mythos. None of this will happen to Humanitism. In this new church there are no easy adventures, no falls, no sorrows, no childish joys. Love, for example, is a priesthood, reproduction a ritual. As life is the greatest benefit of the universe, and there is no beggar who does not prefer misery to death (which is a delightful influx of Humanitas), it follows that the transmission of life, far from being an occasion of gallantry, is the supreme hour of the spiritual mass. For truly there is only misfortune: it is not to be born.",18,RO005TR04
7851,1331,"Imagine, for example, that I was not born, continued Quincas Borba; it is a good thing that I would not have the pleasure of talking to you now, eating this potato, going to the theater, and saying everything in one word: to live. Note that I do not make man a mere vehicle of Humanitas; no, he is at the same time a vehicle, a coachman and a passenger; it is the reduced Humanitas itself; hence the need to worship oneself. Do you want proof of the superiority of my system? Contemplate envy. There is no Greek or Turkish moralist, Christian or Muslim, who does not thunder against the feeling of envy. The accordo is universal, from the fields of Idumea to the top of Tijuca.",18,RO005TR04
7852,1332,"Well; gives up the old prejudices, forgets the ragged rhetorics, and studies envy, that feeling so subtle and noble. Each man being a reduction of Humanitas, it is clear that no man is fundamentally opposed to another man, whatever the contrary appearances. Thus, for example, the executioner executes the condemnate could excite the vain clamor of the poets; but substantially it is Humanitas that corrects in Humanitas an infraction of the law of Humanitas. The same will say of the individual who gut the other; is a manifestation of the strength of Humanitas. Nothing hinders (and there are examples) that he is even gutted. If you have understood well, you will easily understand that envy is nothing more than an admiration which strives, and the struggle being the great function of the human genre, all bellicose feelings are the most suited to your happiness.

7854,1334,"Why deny it? I was stunned. The clarity of the exposition, the logic of the principles, the rigor of the consequences, all seemed superior, and I had to suspend the conversation for a few minutes, as I would digest the new philosophia. Quincas Borba could barely cover the satisfaction of triumph. He had an aza of chicken on his plate, and he crunched it with philosophical serenity. I made him some objections, but so loose, that he did not spend much time in destroying them.",18,RO005TR04

7857,1337,"Between the cheese and the coffee Quincas Borba showed me that his system was the destruction of the pain. The pain, according to Humanitism, is a pure illusion. When the child is threatened by a páuu, before he is even beaten, he closes his eyes and trembles; this predisposition is what constitutes the basis of human illusion, inherited and transmitted. It is certainly not enough to adopt the system to end the pain soon; but it is indispensable; the rest is the natural evolution of things. Once man is well aware that he is the Humanitas himself, he has nothing more than to trace the thought back to the original substance to prevent any painful sensation. But evolution is so profound that it can scarcely be attributed to it for thousands of years.",18,RO005TR04

If the passion of power is the strongest of all, as some inculcate, imagine the despair, the pain, the dullness of the day when I lost the chair of the Chamber of Deputies. I was hoping all of them; political career was over. And note that Quincas Borba, by philosophical inductions he made, felt that my ambition was not the true passion of power, but a whim, a wish to cheer.",18,RO005TR04

A Cromwell or a Bonaparte, he added, so even as the passion of power burns them, they reach there by the right force, or by the right or left ladder. This was not my feeling; this, not having the same force in itself, does not have the same certainty of the result; and hence the greatest affliction, the greatest disenchantment, the greatest sorrow. My feeling, according to Humanitism ...",18,RO005TR04

I noticed that she had been sincerely cheerful, even if she had had the joy, according to a great philosopher. He made me observe the beauty of the spectacle, recalled the object of the struggle, concluded that the dogs were hungry; but the deprivation of food was nothing for the general purposes of philosophia. Nor did he fail to remember that in some parts of the globe the spectacle is more grandiose: the human creatures are that they dispute to the dogs the bones and other less appealing foods; a struggle that is very complicated, because the intelligence of man comes into play, with all the accumulation of wit that the centuries have given him, and so on.",18,RO005TR04

The only objection to Quincas Borba's word was that I was not a doudo, but generally not having the other concepts of themselves, such an objection was worthless. And there is some ground in the popular belief that the philosophes are men alien to the least things. The next day Quincas Borba sent me an alienist. I knew him, I was terrified. Elle, however, had the greatest delicacy and skill, and said good—bye to me, and encouraged me to ask him if he really thought I was a doudo.",18,RO005TR04

8108,1588,"Imagine my affliction. The alienist, seeing the effect of his words, acknowledged that I was a friend of Quincas Borba, and tried to lessen the gravity of the warning. He observed that it might be nothing, and he added, until a grain of sandice, far from doing any harm, gave a certain peak to life. As I rejected this opinion with horror, the alienist smiled and told me something so extraordinary, so extraordinary, that it deserves no less than a chapter.",18,RO005TR04

8111,1591,"You must remember, said the alienist, of that famous Athenian maniac, who assumed that all the ships entering Piraeus were his property. He was no more than a poor fellow, who might not have slept in Diogenes's tub; but the imaginary possession of ships was worth all the drachmas of Hellade. Well, there is in us all a maniac of Athenas; and whoever swear that he has not at any time possessed, mentally, two or three patachos, at least he can believe that he swears falsely.",18,RO005TR04

8116,1596,"In fact, it was one of my servants who beat the carpets while we talked in the garden next door. The alienist then noticed that he had opened the windows for a long time, that he had lifted the curtains, that he had devastated the room, richly decorated, so that they could see it, and concluded:",18,RO005TR04

8130,1610,"It was about this time that I reconciled again with Cotrim, without even knowing the cause of the dissent. Opposite reconciliation, because loneliness weighed me like a remorse, and life was to me the worst of fatigues, which is fatigue without work. Shortly afterwards I was invited by him to join me in a Third Order; which I did not do without consulting Quincas Borba:",18,RO005TR04
8131,1611,"Go if you will, said this, but temporarily. I try to add to my philosophia a dogmatic and liturgical part. Humanitism must also be a religion, that of the future, the only true religion. Christianity is good for women and beggars, and other religions are not worth more than this: they all pray for the same vulgarity or weakness. The Christian paradise is a worthy emulator of Mussulman's paradise; and as for Buddha's nirvana, it is only a conception of paralytics. You will see what the humanistic religion is. The final absorption, the contractive phase, is the reconstitution of the substance, not its annihilation, etc. Goes where they call you; But do not forget that you are my caliph.",18,RO005TR04

Moreover, the phenomena of consciousness are difficult to analyze; On the other hand, if he counted one, he would have to count all those who arrested him, and ended up doing a psychology chapter. I affirm only that it was the brightest phase of my life. The pictures were sad; they had the monotony of doom, which is as boring as joy, and perhaps worse. But the joy which is given to the soul of the sick and the poor is a reward of some value; and do not tell me it's negative, just receive the gift.

But I will not end the chapter without saying that I saw death in the hospital of the Order, guess who? ... beautiful Marcella; and I saw her die on the same day when, visiting a tenement, to distribute alms, I found ... Now you can not guess ... I found the flower of the bush, Eugenia, the daughter of Don Eusebia and Villaça, as limp as he had left her, and even more sad.",18,RO005TR04
8137,1617,"When she recognized me, she was pallid, and she lowered her eyes; but it was the work of an instant. He raised his head and looked at me with great dignity. I realized that I would not receive alms from my pocket, and I extended my hand to him, as I would do to the wife of a capitalist. He courted me and closed himself in the cubicle. I never saw her again; he knew nothing of her life, nor whether her mother was dead, nor what disaster had brought her such misery. I know she was still thigh and sad. It was with this deep impression that I arrived at the hospital, where Marcella had come in the evening, and where I saw her expire half an hour later, ugly, thin, decrepit...",18,RO005TR04

8140,1620,"I realized that I was old, and I needed strength; but Quincas Borba had left six months earlier for Minas Geraes, and took with him the best of philosophies. He returned four months later, and entered me one morning, almost in the state in which I had seen him on the Promenade. The difference is that the look was different. It came insane. He told me that, for the purpose of perfecting Humanitism, he would have burned the entire manuscript and would recommence it. The dogmatic part was complete, though not written; was the true religion of the future.",18,RO005TR04

Quincas Borba was not only mad, but he knew that he was mad, and this rest of consciousness, like a loose lamp in the midst of darkness, made the horror of the situation very complicated. He knew it, and was not angry with evil; on the contrary, he told me that it was still a proof of Humanitas, who thus played with himself.",18,RO005TR04
8144,1624,"He recited to me long chapters of the book, and antiphons, and spiritual litanies; even reproduced a sacred dance which he had invented for the ceremonies of Humanitism. The lugubrious grace with which he lifted and shook his legs was singularly fantastic. At other times he was cuddling in a corner, his eyes staring into the air, eyes that, from afar at a distance, glowed with a lingering ray of reason, sad as a tear ...",18,RO005TR04

8148,1628,"Between the death of Quincas Borba and mine, they mediated the successes narrated in the first part of the book. The chief of them was the invention of the plaster Braz Cubas, who died with me, because of the annoyance I picked up. Divine plaster, you would give me the first log among men, above science and wealth, because you were the genuine and direct inspiration of the sky. Chance determined the opposite; and there you remain forever hypocritical.",18,RO005TR04
8149,1629,"This last chapter is all about negatives. I did not attain the celebrity of the poultice, I was not a minister, I was not a caliph, I did not know the marriage. It is true that, beside these faults, I was fortunate enough not to buy bread with the sweat of my face. More: I did not suffer the death of D. Placida, nor the semi—dementia of Quincas Borba. With some things taken and others, anyone will imagine that there was no mingua or surplus, and consequently that comes out quite with life. And he will imagine evil; because on reaching this other side of the mysterium, I found myself with a small balance, which is the final negative of this chapter of negatives: — I did not have children, I did not transmit to any creature the legacy of our misery.",18,RO005TR04
